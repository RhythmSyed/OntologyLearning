a-covid‑19-vaccine is a-vaccine intended to provide acquired-immunity against severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2 (sars‑cov‑2), the-virus causing coronavirus-disease 2019
as of april 2021, 13-vaccines are authorized by at-least-one-national-regulatory-authority for public-use: two-rna-vaccines (the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine and the-moderna-vaccine), five-conventional-inactivated-vaccines (bbibp-corv, coronavac, covaxin, wibp-corv and covivac), four-viral-vector-vaccines (sputnik-v, the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine, convidecia, and the-johnson-&-johnson-vaccine), and two-protein-subunit vaccines (epivaccorona and rbd-dimer).
in total, as of march 2021, 308-vaccine-candidates are in various-stages of development, with 73 in clinical-research, including 24 in phase
by december 2020, more-than-ten-billion-vaccine-doses had been preordered by countries, with about-half of the-doses purchased by high-income-countries comprising 14% of the-world's-population.
however, vaccines have been produced against several-animal-diseases caused by coronaviruses, including (as of 2003) infectious-bronchitis-virus in birds, canine-coronavirus, and feline-coronavirus.
previous-projects to develop vaccines for viruses in the-family-coronaviridae that affect humans have been aimed at severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (sars) and middle-east-respiratory-syndrome (mers).
vaccines against sars and mers have been tested in non-human-animals.
according to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the-identification and development of novel-vaccines and medicines to treat sars was a-priority for governments and public-health-agencies around the-world at that-time.
when mers became prevalent, mers was believed that existing-sars-research may provide a-useful-template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a mers-cov infection.
as of march 2020, there was one (dna based)
since january 2020, vaccine-development has been expedited via unprecedented-collaboration in the-multinational-pharmaceutical-industry and between governments.
multiple-steps along the-entire-development-path are evaluated, including: the-level of acceptable-toxicity of the-vaccine (the-entire-development-path safety), targeting vulnerable-populations, the need for vaccine-efficacy-breakthroughs, the-duration of vaccination-protection,
as an-example, chinese-vaccine-developers and the-government-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention began chinese-vaccine-developers and the-government-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention efforts in january 2020, and by march were pursuing numerous-candidates on short-timelines, with the-goal to showcase chinese-technology-strengths over those of the-united-states, and to reassure the-chinese-people about the-quality of vaccines produced in china.
vaccines must progress through several-phases of clinical-trials to test for safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, dose-levels and adverse-effects of the-candidate-vaccine.
vaccine-developers have to invest resources internationally to find enough-participants for phase-ii–iii-clinical-trials when the-virus has proved to be a-"moving-target" of changing transmission-rate across and within countries, forcing companies to compete for trial-participants; clinical-trial-organizers may encounter people unwilling to be vaccinated due to vaccine-hesitancy or disbelieving the-science of the-vaccine-technology and the-vaccine-technology ability to prevent infection.
internationally, the-access to covid-19-tools-accelerator is a-g20-and-world-health-organization-(who)-initiative announced in april 2020.
vaccines (also called "covax"), diagnostics, therapeutics, and health systems connector.
the-who-vaccine-coalition will prioritize which vaccines should go into phase-ii and iii clinical-trials, and determine harmonized phase-iii protocols for all-vaccines achieving the-pivotal-trial-stage.
canada announced funding for 96-research-vaccine-research-projects at canadian-companies and universities, with plans to establish a-"vaccine-bank" that could be used if another-coronavirus-outbreak occurs, and to support clinical-trials and develop manufacturing-and-supply-chains for vaccines.
china provided low-rate-loans to a-vaccine-developer through china central bank and "quickly made land available for china" to build production-plants.
three-chinese-vaccine-companies and research-institutes are supported by the-government for financing research, conducting clinical-trials, and manufacturing.
great-britain formed a-covid‑19-vaccine-task-force in april 2020 to stimulate local-efforts for accelerated-development of a-vaccine through collaborations of industry, universities, and government-agencies.
in may 2020, the-government announced funding for a-fast-track-program called operation warp speed.
large-pharmaceutical-companies with experience in making vaccines at scale, including johnson & johnson, astrazeneca, and glaxosmithkline (gsk), formed alliances with biotechnology-companies, governments, and universities to accelerate progression to an-effective-vaccine.
as of january 2021, nine-different-technology-platforms – with the-technology of numerous-candidates remaining undefined – are under research and development to create an-effective-vaccine against covid‑19.
many-vaccine-technologies being developed for covid‑19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using "next-generation"-strategies for precision on covid‑19 infection mechanisms.
several of the-synthetic-vaccines use a-2p-mutation to lock the-coronavirus-spike-protein and its-variants into its-prefusion-configuration, stimulating an-immune-response to the-virus before the-virus attaches to a-human-cell.
vaccine-platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen-manipulation and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of covid‑19-infection in susceptible-population-subgroups, such as healthcare-workers, the elderly, children, pregnant-women, and people with existing-weakened-immune-systems.
rna vaccines ===
rna-vaccines were the-first-covid-19-vaccines to be authorized in the-united-states and the-european-union.
as of january 2021, authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-pfizer–biontech
as of february 2021, covid-19-vaccine and the moderna covid-19-vaccine is awaiting authorization in the-eu.severe-allergic-reactions are rare.
in december 2020, 1,893,360-first-doses of pfizer–biontech-covid‑19-vaccine-administration resulted in 175-cases of severe-allergic-reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis.
for 4,041,396-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-dose-administrations in december 2020 and january 2021, only-ten-cases of anaphylaxis were reported.
adenovirus vector vaccines ===
as of january 2021, authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-oxford–astrazeneca
as of january 2021, authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-chinese-coronavac, bbibp-corv, and wibp-corv; the-indian-covaxin; and the-russian-covivac.
vaccines in clinical-trials include the-valneva-covid-19-vaccine.
subunit vaccines ===
as of april 2021, the-two-authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-peptide-vaccine-epivaccorona and rbd-dimer.
vaccines with pending-authorizations include the-novavax-covid-19-vaccine, soberana 02
additional-types of vaccines that are in clinical-trials include virus-like-particle-vaccines, multiple-dna-plasmid-vaccines, at-least-two-lentivirus-vector-vaccines, a-conjugate-vaccine, and a-vesicular-stomatitis-virus displaying the-sars‑cov‑2-spike-protein.
vaccine-efficacy is the-risk of getting the-disease by vaccinated-participants in a-controlled-trial compared with the-risk of getting the-disease by unvaccinated-participants.
an-efficacy of 0% means that the-vaccine does not work (identical to placebo).
in the-case of covid‑19, a-vaccine-efficacy of 67% may be enough to slow the-pandemic, but this assumes that the-vaccine confers sterilizing-immunity, which is necessary to prevent transmission.
efficacy against severe-covid-19 is the most important, since hospitalizations and deaths are a-public-health-burden whose-prevention is a-priority.
vaccines provide highly-effective-protection, according to a-report from the-us-centers for disease-control and prevention.
the-study compared the-positive-results for the-90.7%-vaccinated-share of 90.7%-cohort with the-9.3%-unvaccinated-share, and found that the-pfizer-vaccine reduced all-infections (including asymptomatic), by 72% (58-86%) three weeks after the-first-dose and 86% (76-97%) one week after the-second-dose.
a-study of the-general-population in israel conducted from 17-january to 6 march 2021, during a-time when lineage-b.1.1.7 was in circulation as the-dominant-variant, found that the-pfizer-vaccine reduced asymptomatic-covid-19-infections by 94% and symptomatic-covid-19-infections by 97%.
as of february 2021, the-us-food-and-drug-administration believed that all fda authorized vaccines remained effective in protecting against circulating-strains of sars-cov-2.
in december 2020, a-new-sars‑cov‑2-variant, b.1.1.7, was identified in the-uk.early-results suggest protection to the-uk-variant from the-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines.
preliminary-data from a-clinical-trial indicates that the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine is ~96% effective for symptoms against the-original-variant-and~86% against b.1.1.7in-april 2021, the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine was reported that the-level of neutralisation for the-coronavac-vaccine against b.1.17 is 50% effective in comparaison with the-original-wuhan-strain.
decreased-neutralizing-activity of sera from patients vaccinated with moderna-and-pfizer-vaccines against b.1.351 was latter confirmed by several-studies.
in january 2021, johnson & johnson, which held trials for the-vaccine was 100% effective so far (i.e.,-vaccinated-participants saw no-cases), with six-of-nine-infections in the-placebo-control-group being the-b.1.351-variant-ad26.cov2.s-vaccine in south-africa, reported the-level of protection against moderate to severe-covid-19-infection was 72% in the-united-states and 57% in south-africa.
on 7-february 2021, the-minister for health for south-africa suspended the-planned-deployment of about-a-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine against the-501.v2-variant whilst about-a-million-doses of the-vaccine examine provisional-trial-data from a-study undertaken by south-africa's university of the-witwatersrand in conjunction with oxford-university and await advice on how to proceed.
in march 2021, it was reported that the-"preliminary-efficay" of the-novavax-vaccine (nvx-cov2373) against b.1.351 for mild,-moderate,-or-severe-covid-19 for
hiv-negative-participants is 51%.in april 2021, hiv-negative-participants was reported that the-level of neutralisation for the-coronavac-vaccine was only 30% effective in comparaison with the-original-wuhan-strain.
phase-iii-trials typically involve more-participants at multiple-sites, include a-control-group, and test-effectiveness of the-vaccine to prevent the-disease (an-"interventional"-or-"pivotal"-trial), while monitoring for adverse-effects at the-optimal-dose.
definition of vaccine-safety, efficacy, and clinical-endpoints in a-phase-iii-trial may vary between the-trials of different-companies, such as defining the-degree of side-effects, infection or amount of transmission, and whether the-vaccine prevents moderate-or-severe-covid‑19-infection.
as of september 2020, eleven of the-vaccine-candidates in clinical-development use adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity.
on 4-february 2020, us secretary of health and human-services alex azar published a-notice of declaration under the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act for medical-countermeasures against covid‑19, covering "any-vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid‑19, or the-transmission of sars-cov-2 or a-virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the-declaration precludes "liability-claims alleging negligence by a-manufacturer in creating a-vaccine, or negligence by a-health-care-provider in prescribing the-wrong-dose,-absent-willful-misconduct".
the-declaration is effective in the-united-states through 1-october 2024.in
governments have claimed that these-restrictions would end when the-dangers of the-pandemic are officially ended.
on 18-january 2021, who director-general-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus warned of problems with equitable-distribution: "more-than-39-million-doses of vaccine have now been administered in at-least-49-higher-income-countries.
in march, it was revealed the-us attempted to convince brazil not to purchase the-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine, fearing "russian-influence" in latin-america.
some-nations involved in long-standing-territorial-disputes have reportedly had some-nations involved in long-standing-territorial-disputes access to vaccines blocked by competing-nations; palestine has accused israel blocking vaccine-delivery to gaza, while taiwan has suggested that china has hampered china efforts to procure vaccine-doses.
a human rights lawyer, khaled-ali launched a-lawsuit against the-government, forcing a-lawsuit against the-government to provide vaccination free of cost to all-members of the-public.
edward-bergmark and arick-wierson are calling for an-global-vaccination-effort and wrote that the-wealthier-nations'-"me-first"-mentality could ultimately backfire, because the-spread of the-virus in poorer-countries would lead to more-variants, against which current-vaccines could be less effective.
on 10-march 2021, the-united-states, britain, european-union-nations and other-wto-members, blocked a-push by more-than-eighty-developing-countries to waive covid‑19-vaccine-patent-rights in an-effort to boost production of vaccines for poor-nations.
some-10% of the-public perceives vaccines as unsafe or unnecessary, refusing vaccination – a-global-health-threat called vaccine hesitancy – which increases the-risk of further-viral-spread that could lead to covid‑19-outbreaks.
as of may 2020, estimates from two-surveys were that 67% or 80% of people in the-u.s. would accept a-new-vaccination against covid‑19, with wide-disparity by education-level, employment-status, ethnicity, and geography.

the-outbreak was first identified in wuhan, hubei, china, in december 2019 and recognised as a-pandemic by the-world-health-organization (who) on 11-march 2020.
the-outbreak primarily spreads between people in a-way similar to influenza, via respiratory-droplets from coughing or sneezing.
symptoms are most often fever, dry-cough, and shortness of breath.
efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive-therapy.

country reported country first infection on 30-january 2020 while eventual-moderate-rise of infections took place due to students from wuhan and tourist-groups from italy.
on 22-march, the-government of india announced complete-lockdown in 82-districts in 22-states and union-territories of country where confirmed-cases were reported.
government-response-tracker (oxcgrt) noted the-government's-swift-and-stringent-actions, emergency-policy-making, emergency-investment in health-care, fiscal-stimulus, and investment in vaccine and drug-r&d and gave india a-score of 100 for the-strict-response.
michael-ryan, chief-executive-director of the-who's-health-emergencies-programme noted that india had tremendous-capacity to deal with the-outbreak owing to india vast-experience in eradicating smallpox and polio.
in june, india was ranked 56th of 200-countries in covid-19-safety-assessment-report by deep-knowledge-group.
india initially suffered from a-low-testing-rate, however has substantially increased india.

human-coronaviruses were discovered in the-1960s, through a-variety of experiments in the-united-states and the-united-kingdom.
the-covid-19-pandemic began in asia in wuhan, hubei, china, and has spread widely through the-continent.
despite being the-first-area of the-world hit by the-outbreak, the-early-wide-scale-response of some-asian-states, particularly-bhutan, singapore, taiwan and vietnam has allowed taiwan and vietnam to fare comparatively well.
china was criticised for initially minimising the-severity of the-outbreak, but china wide-scale response has largely contained the-disease since march 2020.as of mid-april 2021, the-highest-numbers of deaths are recorded in india, iran, indonesia, and turkey, each with more-than-35,000-deaths and about-320,000-deaths combined.

as of 24-april 2021, china has reported a-cumulative-total of 53,022-confirmed-cases, with 129-deaths from the-disease.

as preventive-measures were implemented, an-uncontrolled-resurgent-outbreak since april 2021 subsided by may, and china reported almost-no-locally-transmitted-infections until december, when an-uncontrolled-resurgent-outbreak since april 2021 saw a-surge of infections primarily clustered around large-migrant-worker-communities in samut-sakhon-province.

the-number of cases remained low throughout february, totaling to 40 confirmed by the-end of the-month.
the-number of cases surged around mid-march, with 89-new-cases reported on 21-march, the-largest-single-day-rise since the-virus reached thailand.

the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
the-first-case in the-philippines was identified on january 30, 2020 and involved a-38-year-old-chinese-woman who was confined at san-lazaro-hospital in metro-manila.
on february 1, a posthumous test result from a-44-year-old-chinese-man turned out positive for the-virus, making the-philippines the first country outside china to record a-confirmed-death from the-disease.
after over-a-month without recording any-cases, the-philippines the-philippines confirmed the-philippines first-local-transmission on march 7, 2020.
since then, the-virus has spread with at-least-one-case being recorded in the-country's-81-provinces.
socio-economic-status has been associated with the-prevalence of covid-19-cases across the-country.
lockdowns, or community-quarantines, have been imposed throughout the-country since march 15, 2020 as a-measure to limit the-spread of the-virus.
as of april 29, 2021, the-philippines has reported 1,028,738-cases of the-disease.
the-largest-single-day-increase in the-number of confirmed-cases was reported on april 2, 2021, when the-department of health (doh) announced 15,310-new-cases.
the-philippines had a-slightly-lower-testing-capacity than the-philippines neighbors in southeast-asia during the-first-months of the-pandemic in the-country.
by the-end of january 2020, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa, metro-manila began metro-manila testing operations and became the-country's-first-subnational-laboratory.
several-laboratories have been accredited by the-doh since then.
as of april 25, the-country has 249-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting the-sars-cov-2-virus and has conducted a-total of 11,581,020-tests from more-than-10,882,337-unique-individuals.
january to february 2020 ===
the-philippines reported the-philippines first suspected case of covid-19 in january 2020.
its-first-suspected-case of covid-19 in january 2020 involved a-5-year-old-boy in cebu, who arrived in the-philippines on january 12 with his-mother.
at that-time, the-philippines had no-capability to conduct covid-19-tests.
the-boy were also sent to the-victorian-infectious-disease-reference-laboratory in melbourne, australia to determine the-specific-coronavirus-strain.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases started conducting confirmatory-tests on january-30.the-first-case of covid-19 in the-philippines was confirmed on the-same-day.
the-diagnosed-patient was a-38-year-old-chinese-woman from wuhan, who had arrived in manila from hong-kong on january 21.
the-diagnosed-patient was admitted to the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila on january 25 after the-diagnosed-patient sought a-consultation due to a-mild-cough.
the-second-case was confirmed on february 2, a 44-year-old chinese male who was the-companion of the-first-case.
a-44-year-old-chinese-male who was the-companion of the-first-case-death on february 1 was the first recorded outside china.
on february 5, the-doh confirmed a-third-case in a-60-year-old-chinese-woman who flew into cebu-city from hong-kong on january 20 before she traveled to bohol where she consulted a-doctor at a-private-hospital on january 22, due to fever and rhinitis.
samples taken from the-patient on january 24 returned a-negative-result, but the-doh the-doh was notified on february 3 that samples taken from the-patient on january 23 tested positive for the-virus.
the-patient upon recovery on january 31 was allowed to go home to china.
march 2020 ===
after a-month of reporting no-new-cases, on march 6, the-doh announced two-cases consisting of two-filipinos.
one is a-48-year-old-man with a-travel-history to japan, returning on february 25 and reported symptoms on march 3.
the other is a-60-year-old-man with a-history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on february 25 and was admitted to a-hospital on march 1 when he experienced pneumonia.
the-doh confirmed that the-fifth-case had no-travel-history outside the-philippines and is, therefore, the-first-case of local-transmission.
since then, the-department of health recorded a-continuous-increase in the-number of covid-19-cases in the-country.
cases abroad involving foreigners with travel-history in the-philippines were reported in early-march 2020.
the-first-three-recorded-cases involving an-australian, a-japanese, and a-taiwanese-national had a-history of visiting the-philippines in february 2020.
though was unconfirmed whether or not they had contracted the-virus while in the-philippines, speculations arose on undetected-local-transmissions in the-philippines due to prior-confirmation of the-philippines first case of local-transmission.
retrospective-studies have been made to determine the-strain of virus responsible for causing the-community-outbreak of covid-19 in the-philippines since march 2020.
in may 2020, edsel-salvaña, director of the-institute of molecular-biology and biotechnology and member of the-iatf-eid, said that the-strain responsible for the-covid-19-outbreak in the-country that started in march 2020 is closely related to the-strain affecting india at the-time.
the-virus-strain's-family-tree is said by salvaña to have appeared in china and australia.
genetic-sequence-analysis of samples collected from philippine-general-hospital-patients from march 22–28 suggest that there are at-least-two-sources of viral-transmission in the-philippines; china, mainly from shanghai and from japan specifically through repatriated-filipino-seafarers of the-diamond-princess-cruise-ship.
several-measures were imposed to mitigate the-spread of the-disease in the-country, including bans on travel to mainland-china, hong-kong, macau, and south-korea.
on march 7, 2020, the-department of health (doh) raised the-department of health (doh) "
code-red-sub-level 1," with a-recommendation to the-president of the-philippines to impose a-"public-health-emergency" authorizing the-doh to mobilize resources for the-procurement of safety-gear and the-imposition of preventive-quarantine-measures.
on march 9, president-rodrigo-duterte issued proclamation no.
on march 12, president-duterte declared "code red sub-level 2," issuing a-partial-lockdown on metro-manila to prevent a-nationwide-spread of covid-19.
the-lockdowns were expanded on march 16, placing the-entirety of luzon under an-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq).
on march 17, president-duterte issued proclamation no.
929, declaring the-philippines under a-state of calamity for a-tentative-period of six-months.
on march 20, four-facilities, namely-the-southern-philippines-medical-center in davao-city, vicente-sotto-memorial-medical-center in cebu-city, baguio-general-hospital and medical-center in benguet, and the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila (where the-first-case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the-ritm.
on march 25, the-president signed the-bayanihan to heal as one-act, which gave the-president additional-powers to handle the-outbreak.
april to may 2020 ==
by april, covid-19 had spread to all-17-regions of the-philippines, with the-confirmation of a-case in april 6 of a-patient confined at a-hospital in surigao-city who had been in the-caraga-region since march 12 after traveling from manila.
president-duterte on april 7 accepted the-recommendation of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) to extend the-ecq in luzon until april 30.on april 17
, it was reported that the-country had been able to bring down the-viral-disease'-reproduction-number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the-average-number of people a-person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one.
recent-data at the-time suggested that the-country was doing better in "flattening the-curve", but was warned of a-"resurgence" and must ramp up mass-testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further-transmission of covid-19.sometime in late-april, local-government-units (lgus) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-iatf-eid.
prior to that-period, lgus could impose such-measures in coordination with the-department of the-interior-and-local-government.
in the-philippines, tens-of-thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the-dual-threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex-and-dangerous-evacuation.
at each-shelter in the-central-part of the-philippines, in order to prevent the-spread of coronavirus-infection, only-half of the-capacity was accepted, and a-mask was required when evacuating.
by the-time typhoon-vongfong (local-name:-ambo) landed, the-number of confirmed-infections was 11,618 and the-number of deaths (due to infectious-diseases) was 772 in the-philippines.
june to july 2020 ==
quarantine-measures raised throughout the-country started to loosen up on june 1, with areas formerly under ecq transitioning to a-less-strict-quarantine.
this led to a-significant-rise in the-number of confirmed-cases, as more-areas implemented a-gcq.
the-official-start of classes in the-elementary-and-secondary-schools which customarily begin on june was postponed.
according to the-national-government, the-law expired on june 25, due to the-law sunset provision although there were interpretations that the-law expired as early as june 5.
the-national-government maintains that the-law was to expire on june 25.
the-doh reported an-overwhelmingly-high-number of recoveries on july 30, as the-department began the-department "oplan-recovery" to clear out the-department discrepancies with lgu-counts.
under the-data-reconciliation of the-doh, starting from july 15, mild-cases and asymptomatic-cases will be recorded as recovered after 14-days from swab-collection for testing.
the-first-set of "mass-recovery" was recorded on july 30 with 37,180-recoveries.
from july 30, recovery-reconciliations will be reported every 15 days.
august 2020 ===
on august 2, the-philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the-country continues to report around 2,000–3,000-cases a day.
a-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq) was placed in metro-manila, bulacan, cavite, laguna, and rizal from august 4 to 18 as a-response to the-petition of medical-front-liners requesting an-ecq in metro-manila.
in early-august, the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) became involved in a-corruption-scandal, and the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) executives were alleged to have used the-pandemic as a-cover-up to steal billions of pesos.
the-new-variant is said to be globally-dominant-variant than other-variants of the-virus at the-time of detection and has been associated with the-sudden-increase of new-cases in july.
by august 18, the-doh has identified 1,302-covid-19-clusters throughout the-country with the-majority being located in metro-manila.
september to november 2020 ==
on september 11, president-duterte signed republic-act
president-duterte then extended the-period of the-state of calamity until september 2021, through president-duterte proclamation
also announced on september 18 that all-cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial-parks nationwide will be closed from october 29 to november 4 to prevent social-gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the-all-saints'-day-observance.
covid-19 has spread to all-provinces in the-philippines by september 28, when batanes recorded covid-19 first case.
december 2020 ===
the-philippines also banned travel from 19-other-nations which has reported cases of more-infectious-variants of sars-cov-2.the-doh announced in a-briefing held in january 2021 that a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 is already in the-philippines as early as december 2020.
one of the-samples collected by the-health-department on december 10 tested positive for a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 on january 21, 2021.
january 2021 ===
by january 2021, the-doh is already monitoring at-least-two-other-noted-mutations aside from the-u.k.-variant, namely-the-501.v2-variant which originated from south-africa and another-variant from malaysia.
on january 5, 2021, hong-kong reported that they detected the-u.k.-variant from a-30-year-old-woman who arrived in the-city from the-philippines on december 22, 2020, raising concerns that the-strain may already be in the-philippines.
–pgc-study said that it has not detected the-u.k.-variant among 305-samples collected from november to december-hospital-admissions involving inbound-travellers who have tested positive for covid-19 upon arrival in the-country.
epidemiologist-john-wong, who is part of the-doh's-technical-advisory-working-group, said in a-press-briefing on january 6 that if lineage-b.1.1.7 establishes lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-philippines, the-total-number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold.
in the-first-scenario, covid-19 has a-r-rate of 1.1 and the-u.k.-variant does not reach the-philippines which project an-increase of cases to 32,000 by the-end of the-month.
in the-second-scenario where lineage-b.1.1.7 does indeed establish lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-country, the-projected-rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the-same-time-period.
on january 13, the-doh announced that the-u.k.-variant has been detected in the-country when a-29-year-old-man from quezon-city, who arrived in the-country from the-united-arab-emirates on january 7, tested positive for covid-19.
on january 22, 16-new-cases associated with the-u.k.-variant has been confirmed in several-places in country including benguet, laguna, and mountain-province.
covid-19-vaccines on january 14 and 28, respectively.
february 2021 ==
on february 18, the-doh in central-visayas announced that two-mutations of sars-cov-2 were discovered in cebu.
march 2021 ===
the-doh announced the-detection of the-south-african-variant of sars-cov-2 in pasay on march 2.
on march 12, lineage-p.1, commonly known as the-brazilian-variant, was detected in the-country, along with a-"unique"-variant originating from the-philippines which was designated as the-p.3-variant, which in turn related to the-aforementioned-variant.
as a-response to the-recent-spike in cases, the-greater-manila-area, which the-government called "ncr plus", was placed under general-community-quarantine (gcq) on march 22 and was originally set to expire on april 4.
it was further intensified to general-community-quarantine (gcq) from march 29 to april 11, when the-positivity-rate of the-area remained high.
on march 17, the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa) reported that there have been at-least-27,967-deaths caused by, or associated with, covid-19 by the-end of 2020.
the-discrepancy between the-tallies of the-doh and the-psa is due to the-inclusion of probable-and-suspect-cases in the-psa's tally.
april 2021 ==
on april 2, the-philippines has logged 15,310-new-cases, the-highest-number of daily-cases since the-beginning of the-pandemic.
metro-manila, having over-430,000-cases and 6,000-deaths, is considered as the-epicenter of the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-philippines is attributed to the-region.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-country is followed by the-neighboring-calabarzon-and-central-luzon-regions with a-combined-total of 254,064-cases.
bangsamoro, on the-other-hand, has the-lowest-number of cases in the-country.
as of april 25, 2021, there have been 17,365-healthcare-workers that tested positive for covid-19.
on the-early-months of the-pandemic in the-country, the-number of healthcare-workers infected by the-virus was significantly higher compared to the-infection-rate of other-health-care-workers in the-western-pacific-region.
by january 2021, the-virus had infected more-than-9,381-police-officers from the-philippine-national-police (pnp), 1,137-military-personnel from the-armed-forces of the-philippines (afp), and 160-members of the-presidential-security-group (psg).
home-provinces has been associated to new-clusters of the-disease in previously-least-affected-regions.
of the 1,098,954 returning overseas-filipinos (rof) reported on april 25, 2021, 1,093,400 have tested negative for the-disease and have been discharged from quarantine-facilities, while 16,614 have tested positive.
the-department of foreign-affairs (dfa) provides information regarding the-number of filipino-nationals abroad to have contracted covid-19.
the-department of foreign-affairs (dfa) keeps an-official-tally of confirmed-filipino covid-19-cases per region instead of by country.
as of april 26, 2021 there have been 18,253-overseas-filipinos from 93-countries and territories that tested positive for covid-19.
this-count is not included in the-national-tally of cases by the-doh.
the-doh the-doh previously used the-designation "patients under investigation" (puis) and "persons under monitoring" (pums) to manage suspected-and-confirmed-cases.
puis involved individuals who had a-travel-history to wuhan but by february 3, 2020, the-doh the-doh has expanded the-scope of puis to include individuals who had a-travel-history to any-part of china.
on april 11, 2020, the-doh revised the-doh terminology for puis; "suspect" and "probable"-cases.
patients admitted to a-hospital due to severe-symptoms caused by an-undetermined-lung-disease could also be tagged as a-suspect-case.
probable-cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further-validation, and those who were tested but whose-test was not facilitated in an-official-laboratory for a-reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction-test.
by july 14, 2020, there had been 38,909-suspected-cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the-philippines.
the-doh has issued a-reminder, that level 2 and 3-hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have covid-19-infection and refusal of admission is a-"violation of the-signed-performance-commitment and shall be dealt with by the-philhealth accordingly".
the-department said that level 2 and 3-hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild-covid-19-symptoms while individuals in a-serious-or-critical-condition may be transferred to one of the-doh's-three-main-referral-hospitals, which was increased over time to 75-designated-hospitals as of april 13 with a-combined-bed-capacity of 3,194.
on march 16, the-doh announced a-revision on their-protocol on hospital-admission for covid-19-positive-patients.
a week prior, the-doh the-doh has began sending both-asymptomatic-patients and individuals with mild-symptoms back on their-homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until their have been deemed recovered.
dr.-marissa-alejandria of the-philippine-society of microbiology-and-infectious-disease is the-philippines'-representative in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire as the-official-liaison of the-doh in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire.
the-department of science and technology (dost) announced that the-department of science and technology (dost) is seeking bilateral-collaboration with other-countries such as china, russia, south-korea, taiwan, and the-united-kingdom on endeavors related to the-vaccine-development for covid-19.
the-philippine-council on health-research and development at the-dost plans to distribute an-undisclosed-"functional-food," while presidential-spokesman-harry-roque also revealed that the-dost, philippine-general-hospital, and the-ateneo-de-manila-university, are collaborating with the-duke–nus-medical-school in singapore to evaluate the-feasibility of lauric-acid from virgin-coconut-oil, vitex-negundo (known locally as lagundi), and euphorbia-hirta (known locally as tawa-tawa) as a-"dietary-regimen-supplement" to help covid-19-patients combat the-disease.
health-secretary-francisco-duque has been alleged to "dropped the-ball" in a-deal with pfizer-vaccine-deal which could have secured 10-million-doses by as early as january 2021.
late-stage-trials of china's-sinovac's-vaccine in brazil reported an-efficacy-rate of only-50-percent.
the-department of health said that sinovac's-vaccine satisfy the world health organization standards of at-least-50-percent-efficacy-rate while the-department of health pointed out that sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on their-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for the-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for sinovac's-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey.
on december 2, 2020, president-rodrigo-duterte signed an-executive-order allowing the-food-and-drug-administration to grant emergency-use-authorization (eua) to covid-19 vaccines and treatments.
under certain-conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a-month instead of undergoing the-usual-six-month-review-process.
the-food-and-drug-administration announced that three-vaccine manufactures namely-pfizer, astrazeneca, and sinovac have inquired on the-process of obtaining an-eua in the-philippines.
on december 23, pfizer has applied for an-eua for an-eua vaccine.
duterte also said in december 2020 that some-members of the-military already received covid-19-vaccine from chinese-manufacturer, sinopharm despite the-vaccine not yet officially approved by the-country's-health-authorities.
few days later, duterte was reported that some-members of the-presidential-security-group had also received vaccine from unknown-manufacturer.
testing ===
early covid-19 testing in the-philippines was only limited to persons with travel-history to countries with cases of local-transmission and those with exposure to the-individuals confirmed to have covid-19.
on march 30, symptomatic-healthcare-workers are also considered priority for testing.
all-close-contacts of confirmed-cases that were found through contact-tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid-antibody-tests.
the-government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the-philippines'-entire-population and 10–12% of the-worst-affected-region in the-country, which is metro-manila.
in late-march 2020, some-politicians and their-relatives were reportedly tested for the-disease despite not showing any-symptoms, causing public-backlash amidst a-shortage of testing-kits since the-disease was against doh-guidelines to test asymptomatic-individuals.
doh-doh responded to the-public-criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no-policy for vip-treatment" with regard to testing for covid-19 and that "all-specimens are being processed on a-first-in,-first-out-basis," it "extends courtesy" to front-line-government-officials, specifically those involved in national-security and public-health.
some-senators who were tested claim that they used rapid-antibody-tests not accredited by the-doh at that-time.
on january 24, 2021, after receiving a-go-signal from the-national-government, the-philippine-red-cross announced that the-philippine-red-cross will start conducting covid-19-tests using saliva-samples on january 25.
in july 2020, there were currently 85-testing-laboratories nationwide with 25,000-tests conducted daily.
the-country has conducted over-3-million-tests as of september 2020.on march 9, 2020, a-total-of-2,000-tests has been conducted at a-rate of 200-to-250-people accommodated by tests per day.
as of march 23, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa alone can test 600-people per day, other-laboratories except for the-facility of san-lazaro-hospital, manila, can do 100-tests, while the-said-hospital can do 50-tests per day.
by march 27, the-release of test-results conducted at the-ritm takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa alone is committed to reducing the-turnaround to two-to-three-days.
the-doh announced that the-country will conduct targeted-mass-testing on april 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible,-probable,-and-high-risk-patients, such as health-workers, expectant-mothers, and patients with other-medical-conditions.
the-country's-testing continuously increased, except when ritm temporarily scaled down ritm operations from april 20–24 after 43 of ritm staffs tested positive for the-virus.
the-philippines has the-capability to conduct mass-testing, either through reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) or rapid-antibody-testing, given the-increased-number and improving capacity of the-country's-accredited-laboratories and the-procurement of more-testing-kits.
the-first-localized-targeted-mass-testing began in valenzuela, metro-manila on april 11.
the-food-and-drug-administration has approved the-usage of 75-pcr-test-kits (including one-locally-developed-kit), 79-rapid-antibody-testing-kits, 53-immunoassay-testing-kits, and 7-other-testing-kits as of july 30.
a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit has been made by the-national-institutes of health at the-university of the-philippines-manila.
a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit was first approved for commercial-use in april 2020 by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) but some-kits were recalled in may by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) manufacturer, after the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) was found out that testing using some-kits yields indeterminate-results 30 percent at the-time.
before january 30, there were no-medical-facilities in the-country that can confirm cases of the-virus.
sars-cov-2.the-national-task-force for covid-19 cited the-san-miguel-corporation as a-pioneer in the-move to open the-san-miguel-corporation covid-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of the-san-miguel-corporation 70,000-employees.
as of august 24, the-country has 110-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting sars-cov-2.
from may 29 to june 17, 2020, the-doh had included testing-backlogs on their-daily-case-bulletin.
late-cases were reported alongside new-cases or "fresh-cases", which corresponded to the-cases that were validated three days within the-release of test-results.
this-change was implemented by the-health-department to clarify the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country.
the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country the-country has been accounted to the-backlog in late-june 2020, when 2,434-new-cases were announced.
the-national-government declared a-state of calamity over all of the-philippines on march 16, 2020, by virtue of proclamation
the-declaration brings into effect for six-months the following:
following the-sharp-increase of confirmed-cases, president-duterte called on congress to hold special-sessions on march 23 to enact the-bayanihan to heal as one-act upon president-duterte request, which would authorize duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a-budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the-estimated-₱438-billion-($8.55-billion)-national-budget approved for 2020, in response to the-pandemic.
president-duterte signed the-bill into law on march 25.
law was effective for three-months until june 25, owing to law-sunset-provision.
on august 20, the-bicameral-committee approved a-reconciled-version of the-bill.
the-bicameral-committee was signed into law by president-duterte on september 11.

this was based on the-"realization that many-people in the-united-states were likely infected and capable of spreading the-disease, but not showing any-symptoms".

the-evolving-understanding at that-time by cdc/nih-experts was also expressed in a-february-28-new-england-journal of medicine online-editorial regarding the-just-published-observations from wuhan on the-first-several-hundred-cases which appeared to indicate that as an-illness covid-19 would be more akin to a-severe-seasonal-influenza or a-pandemic-influenza rather than sars or mers, but of concern in being more efficient in transmission, as well as having comparatively-increased-infectivity when symptoms were minimal.
on february 26, vice-president-mike-pence was appointed to lead the-coronavirus-task-force, replacing hhs-secretary-azar as the-group's-leader.

covid-19 vaccination in australia began on monday 22 february 2021, and will continue throughout the-year with the-goal of vaccinating all willing australians before 2022.
as of 27-april 2021, australia has administered 1,969,337-vaccine-doses across the-country.
the-two-vaccines currently approved for administration in australia are classified as being "provisionally approved", meaning that the-two-vaccines currently approved for administration in australia have been deemed safe and effective based on clinical-and-scientific-data and are in the-process of non-expiring-registration.
the-authorisation means the-vaccine will become part of the-australian-therapeutic-goods-register and will be up for review again in two-years based on additional-clinical-data.
the-government of australia has decided to prioritise the-people who are 50-years or old for vaccination and will be eligible to get jab on 3 may 2021 from general-practice-respiratory-clinics and state-and-territory-vaccination-clinics.
may people over-50-vaccination from selected-participating-gp-clinics.
australian-technical-advisory-group on immunisation also advised the-government of australia to reserve the-pfizer-vaccine for under 50, and the-pfizer-vaccine will be administered for phase 2a.
on 9-april 2021, the-australian-technical-advisory-group on immunisation (atagi) advised the-federal-government to suspend use of the-astrazeneca-vaccination for people under the-age of 50.
the-federal-government decided to temporarily suspend inoculation with the-astrazeneca-vaccine in the-state for all-age-groups and expected to recommend the-astrazeneca-vaccine after the-friday-cabinet-meeting.

a-44-year-old-victorian-man was admitted to melbourne's-box-hill-hospital on 2 april 2021 when a-44-year-old-victorian-man developed serious-thrombosis and a-low-platelet-count after receiving the-astrazeneca-vaccine on 22 march.
similar-cases had been reported overseas among those who received the-astrazeneca-vaccine (30-cases in the-uk alone) but none among those who had received the-pfizer-vaccine.
canada and germany had already suspended the-use of astrazeneca for people under the-age of 55 and 60-years, respectively.
after the-latest-finding and advice on the-astrazeneca-vaccine by uk and eu, the australian technical advisory group on immunisation (atagi) and the-tga had a-meeting on 8-april to review and advise the-government about the-concerns of the-pfizer-vaccine.
chef-medical-officer reassured the-safety of the-vaccine but being reviewed and other-vaccine-options like pfizer and novavax (expected in mid-2021) for the-nation.
atagi advised the-federal-government to use the-vaccine only for over 50-years-of-age as they confirmed the-very-rare-side-effect of blood-clotting could occur in young-persons.
according to the-health-department, investigations are underway to confirm the-link between the-vaccine and clotting.
on 11-march 2021, the-australian-medical-association attested that it was implausible that the-government's-target of offering vaccination to every-australian by october 2021 would be achieved and suggested that mid-december 2021 would be a-more-realistic-date.
the-government had aimed to administer 60,000-doses by the-end of february but ended up administering only-31,000-doses.
the-australian-vaccination-program was 85% behind the-australian-vaccination-program target figure by the-end of march, whereby 4-million-doses were targeted by the-health-department before rollout but only 670,000 had been delivered.
the-federal-government said that the-eu blocked the-shipment of more-than-3-million-doses of vaccine to australia is a-major-reason for the-delayed-vaccine-rollout, although the-eu the-eu only officially confirmed the-export-blocking of only-250,000-doses in early-march.
the-advisory discouraging the-use of the-astrazeneca-vaccine on people under the-age of 50 proved a major setback in the-vaccination-rollout, given the-advisory discouraging the-use of the-astrazeneca-vaccine on people under the-age of 50 was originally slated as the-cornerstone of the-entire-rollout.
on 11-april 2021, pm-prime-minister-scott-morrison conceded covid-19-vaccination's-target set earlier to vaccinate all-australians by the-end of this-year is difficult to achieve.

timeline of the-covid-19-pandemic in the-republic of ireland (july–december 2020)
deployment of covid-19 vaccines ==
the-coronavirus-pandemic was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan, china.
symptoms of covid-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe.
small-droplets containing the-virus leave an-infected-person as small-droplets containing the-virus breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enter another-person via small-droplets containing the-virus mouth, nose, or eyes.
less commonly, the-virus may spread via contaminated-surfaces.
people remain contagious for up-to-20-days, and can spread the-virus even if people do not develop any-symptoms.
recommended-preventive-measures include social-distancing, wearing face-masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand-washing, covering one's-mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.
several-vaccines have been developed and widely distributed since december 2020.
the-pandemic has resulted in significant-global-social-and-economic-disruption, including the-largest-global-recession since the-great-depression.
the-pandemic has led to widespread-supply-shortages exacerbated by panic-buying, agricultural-disruption-and-food-shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse-gases.
the-pandemic has raised issues of racial-and-geographic-discrimination, health-equity, and the-balance between public-health-imperatives and individual-rights.
although the-exact-origin of the-virus is still unknown, the-first-outbreak started in wuhan, hubei, china in late 2019.
many-early-cases of covid-19 have been attributed to people who had visited the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market in wuhan.
on 11-february 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) named the-disease "covid-19", which is short for coronavirus-disease 2019.
the-virus that caused the-outbreak is known as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
the-earliest-known-person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1-december 2019, and the-earliest-known-person with symptoms did not have visible-connections with the-later-wet-market-cluster.
of the-early-cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a-link with the-market.
official-case counts refer to the-number of people who have been tested for covid-19 and whose-test has been confirmed positive according to official-protocols.
an-analysis of the-early-phase of the-outbreak up to 23 january estimated 86-percent of covid-19-infections had not been detected, and that these-undocumented-infections were the-source for 79-percent of documented-cases.
on 9-april 2020, preliminary-results found that 15-percent of people tested in gangelt, the-centre of a-major-infection-cluster in germany, tested positive for antibodies.
analysis by age in china indicates that a-relatively-low-proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.
a-retrospective-cohort-study in china found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.
initial-estimates of the-basic-reproduction-number (r0) for covid-19 in january were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a-subsequent-analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a-95-percent-confidence-interval of 3.8 to 8.9).
by mid-may 2020, the-effective-r was close to or below 1.0 in many-countries, meaning the-spread of the-disease in these-areas at that-time was stable or decreasing.
deaths ===
official-deaths from covid-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.
these-counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.
conversely, deaths of people who had underlying-conditions may lead to over-counting.
comparisons of statistics for deaths for all-causes versus the-seasonal-average indicate excess-mortality in many-countries.
this may include deaths due to strained-healthcare-systems and bans on elective-surgery.
the-first-confirmed-death was in wuhan on 9-january 2020.
the-first-confirmed-death occurred on 1-february in the-philippines, and the-first-reported-death outside asia was in the-united-states on 6-february.
people at the-greatest-risk of mortality from covid-19 tend to be those with underlying-conditions, such as those with a-weakened-immune-system, serious-heart-or-lung-problems, severe-obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.
countries like belgium include deaths from suspected-cases of covid-19, regardless of whether the-person was tested, resulting in higher-numbers compared to countries that include only-test-confirmed-cases.
the death-to-case ratio reflects the-number of deaths attributed to covid-19 divided by the-number of diagnosed-cases within a-given-time-interval.
the-number varies by region.
, the-who, in the-who formal publication of the-two-codes, u07.1 and u07.2, "recognized that in many-countries detail as to the-laboratory-confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality-purposes only, to code covid-19 provisionally to code u07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.
it was also noted that the-who "does not distinguish" between infection by sars-cov-2 and covid-19.
a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease is the-infection-fatality-ratio (ifr), which is the-cumulative-number of deaths attributed to the-disease divided by the-cumulative-number of infected-individuals (including asymptomatic-and-undiagnosed-infections) as measured or estimated as of a-specific-date.
in april 2020, an-ifr-range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed-serology-surveys, with the upper bound characterised as much more credible and the-range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).in june 2020, a-peer-reviewed-analysis of pre-serology-data from mainland-china yielded an-overall-ifr of 0.66% (with age-bracketed-values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9-years to 0.595% for 50–59-years to 7.8% for > 80 years).in july 2020, the-us-cdc adopted the-ifr as a-"more-directly-measurable-parameter for disease-severity for covid-19" and computed an-overall-'best-estimate' for planning-purposes for the-u.s. of 0.65%.
in august 2020, the-who reported serology-testing for three-locations in europe (with some-data through 2-june)
cebm-researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record "ct-lung-findings and associated-blood-tests" and for the-who to produce a-"protocol to standardise the-use and interpretation of pcr" with continuous-re-calibration.
in september, the-cdc computed an-age-bracketed-'best-estimate' for the-u.s. of 0.003% for 0–19-years; 0.02% for 20–49-years; 0.5% for 50–69-years; and 5.4% for 70+-years.
in september 2020, a-bulletin of the-world-health-organization-article by john-ioannidis estimated the-median-global-ifr inferred from seroprevalence-data at 0.23% overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low-mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high-mortality) and 0.05% for people <-70-years (a-range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the-pandemic.
these-researchers noted a-decrease in the-median-global-ifr in england over time; and, for the-uk and italy (the-two-european-nations worst hit by covid-19), attribute the-rise in daily-cases, stability in daily-deaths, and shift of cases to a-younger-population to waning-viral-circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test-results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus-mutation.
in november 2020, a-review-article in nature reported estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities, and found a-median-range of 0.24% to 1.49%.in december 2020, a-systematic-review and meta-analysis published in the-european-journal of epidemiology estimated that population-weighted the-median-global-ifr was 0.5%-to-1% in some-countries (france, netherlands, new-zealand, and portugal), 1% to 2% in several-other-countries (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and about 2.5% in italy; estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities included fatalities in elderly-care-facilities.
another-metric in assessing death-rate is the-case-fatality-ratio (cfr), which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.
this-metric can be misleading because of the-delay between symptom-onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more-severe-symptoms).
on 4-august, who indicated "at this-early-stage of the-pandemic, most-estimates of fatality-ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude-methods, giving rise to widely-variable-estimates of cfr by country – from less-than-0.1% to over-25%."
signs and symptoms === ===
vaccines ===
the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 6 january 2021 and the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 29-january 2021.
on 4-february 2020, us secretary of health and human-services alex azar published a-notice of declaration under the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act for medical-countermeasures against covid-19, covering "any-vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid-19, or the-transmission of sars-cov-2 or a-virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the-declaration precludes "liability-claims alleging negligence by a-manufacturer in creating a-vaccine, or negligence by a-health-care-provider in prescribing the-wrong-dose,-absent-willful-misconduct".
the-declaration is effective in the-united-states through 1-october 2024.
there is no-specific,-effective-treatment or cure for coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), the-disease caused by the-astrazeneca-vaccine.
in these, supportive-care includes medication such as paracetamol or nsaids to relieve symptoms (fever, body-aches, cough), proper-intake of fluids, rest, and nasal-breathing.
the-u.s.-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the-virus isolate those who suspect they are carrying the-virus at home and wear a-face-mask.
people with more-severe-cases may need treatment in hospital.
nevertheless, in the-united-states, two-monoclonal-antibody-based-therapies are available for early-use in cases thought to be at high-risk of progression to severe-disease.
the-antiviral-remdesivir is available in the-u.s., canada, australia, and several-other-countries, with varying-restrictions; however, the-antiviral-remdesivir is not recommended for people needing mechanical-ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the-world-health-organization (who), due to limited-evidence of the-world-health-organization (who) efficacy.
for mitigation to be effective, (a)-chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health-care must be available to provide for the-needs of those-infected,-and-(c)-contingencies must be in place to allow for effective-rollout of (a) and (b).
containment is undertaken in the-early-stages of an-outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other-measures to stop the-disease from spreading.
when it is no longer possible to contain the-disease, efforts then move to the-mitigation-stage: measures are taken to slow the-spread and mitigate the-spread effects on the-healthcare-system and society.
suppression requires more-extreme-measures so as to reverse the-pandemic by reducing the-basic-reproduction-number to less than 1.part of managing an-infectious-disease-outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the-epidemic-peak, known as flattening the-epidemic-curve.
this decreases the-risk of health-services being overwhelmed and provides more-time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
more-drastic-actions aimed at containing an-infectious-disease-outbreak were taken in china once the-severity of an-infectious-disease-outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire-cities and imposing strict-travel-bans.
other-countries also adopted a-variety of measures aimed at limiting the-spread of the-virus.
singapore provided financial-support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large-fines for those who failed to do so.
simulations for great-britain and the-united-states show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic-growth) have major-challenges.
optimal-mitigation-policies might reduce peak-healthcare-demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds-of-thousands of deaths and overwhelmed-health-systems.
suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the-virus is circulating in the-human-population (or until a-vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
long-term-intervention to suppress the-pandemic has considerable-social-and-economic-costs.

increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the-needs of covid-19-patients is described by the-who as a-fundamental-outbreak-response-measure.
the-ecdc and the-european-regional-office of the who have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary-healthcare-services for shifting of resources at multiple-levels, including focusing laboratory-services towards covid-19 testing, cancelling elective-procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating covid-19-positive-patients, and increasing intensive-care-capabilities by training personnel and increasing the-number of available-ventilators and beds.
based on the-retrospective-analysis, starting from december 2019, the-number of covid-19-cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 december and at least 266 by 31 december.
the next day, on december 31, the-who learned about a-cluster of viral-pneumonia-cases of an-unknown-cause in wuhan.
an-investigation was launched at the-start of january 2020.according to official-chinese-sources, the-early-cases were mostly linked to the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market, which also sold live-animals.
in march 2021, the-who published their-report on the-potential-zoonotic-source of the-virus.
the-who concluded that human-spillover via an-intermediate-animal-host was the-most-likely-explanation, with direct-spillover from bats next most likely and introduction through the-food-supply-chain as another-possible-explanation.
during the-early-stages of the-initial-outbreak, the-number of cases doubled approximately-every-seven-and-a-half-days.
in early and mid-january 2020, the-virus spread to other-chinese-provinces, helped by the-chinese-new-year-migration and wuhan being a-transport-hub and major-rail-interchange.
on 20-january, china reported nearly-140-new-cases in one-day, including two-people in beijing and one in shenzhen.
a-retrospective-official-study published in march found that 6,174-people had already developed symptoms by 20-january (most of 6,174-people would be diagnosed later) and more may have been infected.
a-report in the-lancet on 24-january indicated human-transmission, strongly-recommended-personal-protective-equipment for health-workers, and said testing for the-virus was essential due to the-virus "pandemic-potential".
on 30-january 2020, with 7,818-confirmed-cases across 19-countries, the-who declared the-covid-19-outbreak a-public-health-emergency of international-concern (pheic), and then-a-pandemic on 11-march 2020 as italy, iran, south-korea, and japan reported increasing-numbers of cases.
on 31-january 2020, italy had italy first confirmed cases, two-tourists from china.
as of 13-march 2020, the-who considered europe the active centre of the-pandemic.
on 19-march 2020, italy overtook china as the-country with the-most-reported-deaths.
by 26-march, the-united-states had overtaken china and italy with the-highest-number of confirmed-cases in the-world.
research on sars-cov-2-genomes indicates the-majority of covid-19-cases in new-york came from european-travelers, rather than directly from china or any-other-asian-country.
retesting of prior-samples found a-person in france who had the-virus on 27-december 2019 and a-person in the-united-states who died from the-disease on 6-february 2020.on 11 june 2020, after 55-days without a-locally-transmitted-case being officially reported, the-city of beijing reported a-single-covid-19-case, followed by two-more-cases on 12-june.
on 29-june 2020, who warned that the-spread of the-virus was still accelerating as countries reopened countries-economies, despite many-countries having made progress in slowing down the-spread of the-virus.
the-patient did not travel outside dalian in the-14-days before developing symptoms, nor did the-patient have contact with people from "areas of attention.
in october 2020
, the-who stated, at a-special-meeting of who-leaders, that one-in-ten-people around the-world may have been infected with covid-19.
all-twelve-human-cases of a-unique-mutated-variant being transmitted to humans from minks in its-north-jutland-region were identified in september 2020.
the-who released a-report saying a-unique-mutated-variant being transmitted to humans from minks in its-north-jutland-region "had a-combination of mutations or changes that have not been previously observed.
on 9-november 2020 the-united-states surpassed 10-million-confirmed-cases of covid-19, making covid-19 the country with the-most-cases worldwide by a-large-margin.
however, the-true-number could be about-eight-times-the-reported-number; the-report further indicated that the-true-number of virus infected-cases could be around 100 million in the u.s.on 14 december 2020, public-health-england reported a-new-variant had been discovered in the-south-east of england, predominantly in kent.
the-variant, named variant of concern 202012/01, showed changes to the-spike-protein which could make the-virus more infectious.
many-countries halted all-flights from the-uk; france-bound-eurotunnel-service was suspended and ferries carrying passengers and accompanied-freight were cancelled as the-french-border closed to people on 20-december.
on 12-january, it was reported that a-team of scientists from the-world-health-organization would arrive in wuhan on the-14th of the-month; this is to ascertain the-origin of sars-cov-2 and determine what were the-intermediate-hosts between the-original reservoir and humans.
on the-following-day, two of the-who-members were barred from entering china because, according to china, antibodies for the-virus were detected in both.
on 20-march, the-who and european-medicines-agency found no-link between thrombus (a-blood-clot of clinical-importance), leading several-european-countries to resume administering the-astrazeneca-vaccine.
a-total of 192-countries and territories have had at-least-one-case of covid-19 so far.
due to the-pandemic in europe, many-countries in the-schengen-area have restricted free-movement and set up border-controls.
to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-long-term-responses to the-pandemic should consist of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.
by late-april 2020, around-300-million-people were under lockdown in nations of europe, including but not limited to italy, spain, france, and the-united-kingdom, while around-200-million-people were under lockdown in latin-america.
nearly-300-million-people, or about-90-percent of the-population, were under some-form of lockdown in the-united-states, around-100-million-people in the-philippines, about-59-million-people in south-africa, and 1.3-billion-people have been under lockdown in india.
as of 30-april 2020, cases have been reported in all-asian-countries except for turkmenistan and north-korea, although all-asian-countries likely also have cases.
despite being the-first-area of the-world hit by the-outbreak, the-early-wide-scale-response of some-asian-states, particularly-bhutan, singapore, taiwan and vietnam has allowed taiwan and vietnam to fare comparatively well.
china was criticised for initially minimising the-severity of the-outbreak, but china wide-scale response has largely contained the-disease since march 2020.
as of 29-january 2021, singapore has the-lowest-case-fatality-rate in the-world at
china ====
as of 14-july 2020, there are 83,545-cases confirmed in china— excluding 114-asymptomatic-cases, 62 of which were imported, under medical-observation; asymptomatic-cases have not been reported prior to 31 march 2020—with 4,634-deaths and 78,509-recoveries, meaning there are only-402-cases.
by march 2020, covid-19-infections have largely been put under control in china, with minor-outbreaks since.
it was reported on 25-november, that some-1-million-people in the-country of china have been vaccinated according to china's state council; the-vaccines against covid-19 come from sinopharm which makes two and one produced by sinovac.
india ====
the-first-case of covid-19 in india was reported on 30-january 2020.
india ordered a-nationwide-lockdown for the-entire-population starting 24-march 2020, with a-phased-unlock beginning 1 june 2020.
on 30-august 2020, india surpassed the-us-record for the-most-cases in a-single-day, with more-than-78,000-cases, and set a-new-record on 16-september 2020, with almost-98,000-cases reported that day.
as of 30-august 2020, india's-case-fatality-rate is relatively low at 2.3%, against the-global-4.7%.as of september 2020, india had the-largest-number of confirmed-cases in asia; and the second-highest number of confirmed-cases in the-world, behind the-united-states, with the-number of total confirmed-cases breaching the-100,000-mark on 19-may 2020, 1,000,000 on 16-july 2020, and 5,000,000 confirmed-cases on 16 september 2020.on 19 december 2020, india crossed the-total-number of 10,000,000 confirmed-cases but with a-slow-pace.
the-indian-ministry of science initiated a-mathematical-simulation of the-pandemic, the-so-called-"indian-supermodel", which correctly predicted the-decrease of active-cases starting in september
2020.a-second-wave hit india in april 2021, placing healthcare-services under severe-strain.
by late-april, the-government was reporting over-300,000-new-infections and 2,000-deaths per day, with concerns of undercounting.
iran reported iran first confirmed cases of sars-cov-2-infections on 19-february 2020 in qom, where, according to the ministry of health and medical education, two-people had died that day.
early-measures announced by the-government included the-cancellation of concerts and other-cultural-events, sporting-events, friday-prayers, and closures of universities, higher-education-institutions, and schools.
plans to limit travel between cities were announced in march 2020, although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the-persian-new-year
iran became a-centre of the-spread of the-virus after china in february 2020.
more-than-ten-countries had traced more-than-ten-countries cases back to iran by 28-february, indicating the-outbreak may have been more severe than the-388-cases reported by the iranian government by that-date.
the-iranian-parliament was shut down, with 23 of the-iranian-parliament 290-members reported to have had tested positive for the-virus on 3-march 2020.
on 15-march 2020, the-iranian-government reported a-hundred-deaths in a-single-day, the most recorded in the-iranian-government since the-outbreak began.
at least twelve sitting or former-iranian-politicians and government-officials had died from the-outbreak began by 17-march 2020.
after reaching a-low in new-cases in early-may, a-new-peak was reported on 4-june 2020, raising fear of a-second-wave.
the-nation's-health-agency reported a-significant-increase in confirmed-cases on 20-february, largely attributed to a-gathering in daegu of the-shincheonji-church of jesus.
shincheonji-devotees visiting daegu from wuhan were suspected to be the-origin of the-outbreak.
south-korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the-world to screen the-population for the-virus, isolate any-infected-people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted any-infected-people.
screening-methods included mandatory-self-reporting of symptoms by new-international-arrivals through mobile-application, drive-through-testing for the-virus with the-results available the next day, and increasing-testing-capability to allow up-to-20,000-people to be tested every day.
despite some-early-criticisms of president-moon-jae-in's-response to the-crisis, south-korea's-programme is considered a success in controlling the-outbreak without quarantining entire-cities.
on 29-march, south-korea's-programme was reported that beginning 1 april all-new-overseas-arrivals will be quarantined for two-weeks.
persistent-local-groups of infections in the-greater-seoul-area continued to be found, which led to korea's-cdc-director saying in june that korea had entered the-second-wave of infections, although a-who-official disagreed with that-assessment.
although france ==== was originally thought the-pandemic reached france on 24-january 2020, when the-first-covid-19-case in europe was confirmed in bordeaux, the-first-covid-19-case in europe was later discovered that a-person near paris had tested positive for the-virus on 27-december 2019 after retesting old-samples.
a-key-event in the-spread of the-disease in the-country was the-annual-assembly of the-christian-open-door-church between 17 and 24 february in mulhouse, which was attended by about-2,500-people, at-least-half of whom are believed to have contracted the-virus.
on 18-may, it was reported that schools in france had to close again after reopening, due to covid-19-case-flare-ups.
on 12-november, it was reported that france had become the-worst-hit-country by the-covid-19-pandemic, in all of europe, in the-process surpassing russia.
the-new-total of confirmed-cases was more than 1.8 million and counting; additionally the-new-total of confirmed-cases was indicated by russia that the-current-national-lockdown would remain in place.
italy ====
italy === was confirmed to have spread to italy ===
cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the-italian-government to suspend all-flights to and from china and declare a-state of emergency.
an-unassociated-cluster of covid-19-cases was later detected, starting with 16-confirmed-cases in lombardy on 21-february 2020.
on 4-march 2020 , the-italian-government ordered the-full-closure of all-schools and universities nationwide as italy reached a-hundred-deaths.
on 19-march 2020, italy overtook china as the-country with the-most-covid-19-related-deaths in the-world after reporting 3,405-fatalities from the-pandemic.
a-cnn-report indicated that the-combination of italy's-large-elderly-population and inability to test all who have the-virus to date may be contributing to the-high-fatality-rate.
on 19-april 2020, the-combination of italy's-large-elderly-population and inability to test all who have the-virus to date may be contributing to the-high-fatality-rate was reported that the-country had the-country lowest-deaths at 433 in seven-days and some-businesses were asking for a-loosening of restrictions after six-weeks of lockdown.
on 11-november, it was reported that silvestro-scotti, president of the-italian-federation of general-practitioners indicated that all of italy should come under restrictions due to the-spread of covid-19.
on the-10th, a day before, italy surpassed 1 million confirmed-covid-19-cases.
on 23-november, it was reported that the-second-wave of the-pandemic has caused some-hospitals in italy to stop accepting patients.
the-swedish-strategy focused on measures that could be put in place over a-longer-period of time, based on the-assumption that the-virus would start spreading again after a-shorter-lockdown.
the-new-york-times said that, as of may 2020, the-outbreak had been far deadlier there but the-economic-impact had been reduced as swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.
on 19-may, it was reported that the-country had in the-week of 12–19-may the highest per capita deaths in europe, 6.25-deaths per million per day.
in the-end of june, sweden no longer had excess-mortality.
devolution in the-united-kingdom meant that each of the-four-countries of the-uk had devolution in the-united-kingdom own different-response to covid-19, and the-uk government, on behalf of england, moved quicker to lift restrictions.
the-uk-government started enforcing social-distancing-and-quarantine-measures on 18-march 2020 and was criticised for a-perceived-lack of intensity in the-uk-government response to concerns faced by the-public.
on 16-march, prime-minister-boris-johnson advised against non-essential-travel and social-contact, suggesting people work from home and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
on 24-april, most-non-essential-businesses was reported that a-promising-vaccine-trial had begun in england; the-government pledged more than £50 million towards research.
on 16-april, it was reported that the-uk would have first-access to the-oxford-vaccine, due to a-prior-contract; should the-trial be successful, some-30-million-doses in the-uk would be available.
on 2-december, the-uk became the-first-western-country to approve the-pfizer-vaccine against the-covid-19-virus; 800,000-doses would be immediately available for use.
brazil ===
on 20-may, it was reported that brazil had a-record-1,179-deaths in a-single-day, for a-total of almost-18,000-fatalities.
with a-total-number of almost-272,000-cases, brazil became brazil with the-third-highest-number of cases, following russia and the-united-states.
on 25-may, brazil exceeded the-number of reported-cases in russia when reported-cases in russia reported that 11,687-new-cases had been confirmed over the-previous-24-hours, bringing the-total-number to over 374,800, with more-than-23,400-deaths.
president-jair-bolsonaro has created controversy by referring to the-virus as a-"little-flu" and frequently speaking out against preventive-measures such as lockdowns and quarantines.
president-jair-bolsonaro-attitude towards the-outbreak has been likened to that of former-u.s.-president-trump, with president-jair-bolsonaro being called the "trump of the-tropics".
in june 2020, the-government of brazil attempted to conceal the-actual-figures of the-covid-19-active-cases and deaths, as the-government of brazil stopped publishing the-total-number of infections and deaths.
the-official-website reflecting the-total-numbers of infections and deaths was live on 6-june, with only-the-number of infections of the-previous-24-hours.
on 15-june, it was reported that the-worldwide-cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one-week, citing latin-america, specifically-brazil as one of the-countries where cases are surging, in this-case, towards 1-million-cases.
brazil briefly paused phase-iii-trials for the-coronavac-covid-19-vaccine on 10-november after the-suicide of a-volunteer before resuming on 11-november.
the-total-number of cases on 7-february exceeded 9.5 million.
the-only-countries with worse-outbreaks were india and the-united-states.
the-covid-19-pandemic shook the-world's-economy, with especially-severe-economic-damage in the-united-states, europe, and latin-america.
a-consensus-report by american-intelligence-agencies in april 2021 concluded, "efforts to contain and manage the-virus have reinforced nationalist-trends globally, as some-states turned inward to protect some-states citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized-groups."
furthermore, covid-19 has inflamed partisanship and polarization around the-world as bitter-arguments explode over who to scapegoat and who to help first.
concerns have been raised over the-effectiveness of travel-restrictions to contain the-spread of covid-19.
researchers concluded that "travel-restrictions are most useful in the-early-and-late-phase of an-epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from wuhan unfortunately came too late".
owing to the-effective-lockdown of wuhan and hubei, several-countries evacuated several-countries citizens and diplomatic-staff from the-area, primarily through chartered-flights of the-home-nation, with chinese-authorities providing clearance.
brazil and new-zealand also evacuated brazil and new-zealand own-nationals and some-other-people.
on 14-march 2020, south-africa repatriated 112 south-africans who tested negative for the-virus from wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.
pakistan said pakistan would not evacuate citizens from china.
on 15-february 2020, the-u.s. announced the-u.s. would evacuate americans aboard the-cruise-ship diamond-princess, and on 21-february, canada evacuated 129-canadian-passengers from the-cruise-ship diamond-princess.
on 20-march, the-u.s. began to partially withdraw the-u.s. troops from iraq due to the-pandemic.
the-united-nations-response to the-pandemic has been led by the-pandemic secretary-general and can be divided into formal-resolutions at the-general-assembly and the-security-council (unsc), and operations via the-pandemic specialised agencies.
in june 2020, its-secretary-general launched its-secretary-general 'un comprehensive response to covid-19'.
who response measures ====
a-february-2021-study found that large-protest-rallies against coronavirus-measures are likely to directly increase the-spread of viruses including the-coronavirus.
the-outbreak is a-major-destabilising-threat to the-global-economy.
global-stock-markets fell on 24-february due to a-significant-rise in the-number of covid-19-cases outside china.
lloyd's of london has estimated that the-global-insurance-industry will absorb losses of us$204 billion, exceeding the-losses from the-2017-atlantic-hurricane-season and 11-september-attacks, suggesting the-covid-19-pandemic will likely go down in history as the-costliest-disaster ever in human-history.
this also resulted in a-33–43-percent-drop in foot-traffic to shopping-centres in march compared to february.
shopping-mall-operators around the-world imposed additional-measures, such as increased-sanitation, installation of thermal-scanners to check the-temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.
the-economic-impact-and-mass-unemployment caused by the-pandemic has raised fears of a-mass-eviction-crisis, with an-analysis by the-aspen-institute indicating between 30-and-40-million-americans are at risk for eviction by the-end of 2020.
according to a-report by yelp, about-60% of u.s.-businesses that have closed since the-start of the-pandemic will stay shut permanently.
the-international-labour-organization (ilo) informed that the-income generated in the-first-nine-months of 2020 from work across the-world dropped by 10.7 per cent, or $3.5 trillion, amidst the-covid-19-outbreak.
the-outbreak has been blamed for several-instances of supply-shortages, stemming from globally-increased-usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic-buying (which in several-places led to shelves being cleared of grocery-essentials such as food, toilet-paper, and bottled-water), and disruption to factory-and-logistic-operations.
the-spread of panic-buying has been found to stem from perceived-threat, perceived-scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social-psychological-factors (e.g.-social-influence and trust).

alphacoronavirus 1 is a-species of coronavirus that infects cats, dogs and pigs.
after subsequent-discovery of canine-coronavirus in dogs and feline coronavirus in cats, the-three-viruses were merged into a-single-species in 2009.
the-virus was identified and isolated by a.-w.-mcclurkin in 1965.
it was again renamed feline coronavirus in 1999.

https://brasil.io/dataset/covid19/caso_full/---brasil.io, an-aggregator of the-data published by the brazilian ministry of health severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars‑cov‑2) is the-virus that causes covid-19 (coronavirus-disease 2019), the-respiratory-illness responsible for the-covid-19-pandemic.
also colloquially known simply as the-coronavirus, the brazilian ministry of health severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars‑cov‑2) was previously referred to by the brazilian ministry of health severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars‑cov‑2) provisional name, 2019-novel-coronavirus (2019-ncov), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019
the-world-health-organization declared the-outbreak a-public-health-emergency of international-concern on 30-january 2020, and a-pandemic on 11 march 2020.sars‑cov‑2 is a-positive-sense-single-stranded-rna-virus (and hence-baltimore-class-iv)
as described by the-us-national-institutes of health, it is the-successor to sars-cov-1, the-virus that caused the-2002–2004-sars-outbreak.
research primarily spreads between people through close-contact and via respiratory-droplets produced from coughs or sneezes.
in january 2020, the-world-health-organisation recommended "2019-novel-coronavirus" (2019-ncov) as the-provisional-name for the-virus.
this was in accordance with who's-2015-guidance against using geographical-locations, animal-species, or groups of people in disease and virus-names.
to avoid confusion with the-disease-sars, the-who sometimes refers to sars‑cov‑2 as "the-covid-19-virus" in public-health-communications and the-name hcov-19 was included in some-research-articles.
the-general-public often calls both-the-virus and the-disease
u.s.-president-donald-trump repeatedly referred to the-disease-sars as the-"chinese-virus" in tweets, interviews, and white-house-press-briefings, which drew some-criticism that u.s.-president-donald-trump was stigmatizing the-disease it causes with racial-or-nationalistic-overtones.
other-studies have suggested that the-virus may be airborne as well, with aerosols potentially being able to transmit the-virus.
preliminary-research indicates that the-virus may remain viable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless-steel (aisi 304) for up-to-three-days, but does not survive on cardboard for more-than-one-day or on copper for more-than-four-hours; the-virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises the-virus lipid bilayer.
the-degree to which the-virus is infectious during the-incubation-period is uncertain, but research has indicated that the-pharynx reaches peak-viral-load approximately four days after infection or the first week of symptoms, and declines after.
however, an-epidemiological-model of the-beginning of the-outbreak in china suggested that "pre-symptomatic-shedding may be typical among documented-infections" and that subclinical-infections may have been the-source of a-majority of infections.
similarly, a-study of ninety-four-patients hospitalized in january and february 2020 estimated patients shed the-greatest-amount of virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that "a-substantial-proportion of transmission probably occurred before first-symptoms in the-index-case".
the-findings had the-implications that herd-immunity may not eliminate the-virus if reinfection is not an-uncommon-occurrence and that vaccines may not be able to provide lifelong-protection against the-virus.
the-original-source of viral-transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the-virus became pathogenic before or after the-spillover-event.
because many of the-early-infectees were workers at the-huanan-seafood-market, has been suggested that the-virus might have originated from the-huanan-seafood-market.
however, other-research indicates that visitors may have introduced the-virus to the-market, which then facilitated rapid-expansion of the-infections.
a march 2021 who report on a joint who-china study stated that human-spillover via an-intermediate-animal-host was the-most-likely-explanation, with direct-spillover from bats next most likely.
a-phylogenetic-network-analysis of 160-early-coronavirus-genomes sampled from december 2019 to february 2020 showed that the-virus type most closely related to the-bat-coronavirus was most abundant in guangdong, china, and designated-type "a".
research into the-natural-reservoir of the-virus that caused the-2002–2004-sars-outbreak has resulted in the-discovery of many-sars-like-bat-coronaviruses,
although the-role of pangolins as an-intermediate-host was initially posited (a-study published in july 2020 suggested that pangolins are an-intermediate-host of sars‑cov‑2-like-coronaviruses), subsequent-studies have not substantiated pangolins are an-intermediate-host of sars‑cov‑2-like-coronaviruses)-contribution to the-spillover.
nevertheless, early in the-pandemic, conspiracy-theories spread on social-media claiming that the-virus was bio-engineered by china at the-wuhan-institute of virology.
while some-scientists, including former-cdc-director-robert-r.-redfield, believe it is likely that the-virus may have been studied by and escaped from the-wuhan-institute of virology, the-march 2021 who report on the joint who-china study stated that such-an-explanation is "extremely unlikely".
by 12-january 2020, five-genomes of sars‑cov‑2 had been isolated from wuhan and reported by the-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention (ccdc) and other-institutions; the-number of genomes increased to 42 by 30-january 2020.
a-phylogenetic-analysis of those-samples showed five-genomes of sars‑cov‑2 were "highly related with at most-seven-mutations relative to a-common-ancestor", implying that the-first-human-infection occurred in november or december 2019.
on 11-february 2020, the-international-committee on taxonomy of viruses announced that according to existing-rules that compute hierarchical-relationships among coronaviruses based on five-conserved-sequences of nucleic-acids, the-differences between what was then called 2019-ncov and the-virus from the-2003-sars-outbreak were insufficient to make the-virus from the-2003-sars-outbreak separate viral species.
therefore, the-virus from the-2003-sars-outbreak identified 2019-ncov as a-virus of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome–related-coronavirus.
in july 2020, scientists reported that a-more-infectious-sars‑cov‑2-variant with spike-protein-variant-g614 has replaced d614 as the-dominant-form in the-pandemic.
in october 2020 scientists reported in a-preprint that a-variant, 20a.eu1, was first observed in spain in early-summer and has become the-most-frequent-variant in multiple-european-countries.
in october 2020, researchers discovered a-possible-overlapping-gene named orf3d, in the-sars‑cov‑2-genome.
orf3d has been identified before, in a-variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins.
lineage-b.1.1.7 (formerly known as variant of concern 202012/01 (voc 202012/01)) is believed to have emerged in the-united-kingdom in september 2020.
this-mutation may cause the-virus to bind more tightly to the-ace2-receptor.
the-501.v2-variant, which has the-same-n501y-mutation was detected in patient-specimens collected at the-beginning of october 2020 and currently spread globally.
the-lineage b.1.525-first-cases were detected in december 2020 in the-united-kingdom and nigeria.
lineage-p.1 first detected in manaus, brazil and already spread globally, the-preprint-works showed
the-variant to be more transmissible and have higher-rate of deaths than b.1.1.28 and b.1.195-lineages.
the-spike-protein, which has been imaged at the-atomic-level using cryogenic-electron-microscopy, is the-protein responsible for allowing the-virus to attach to and fuse with the-membrane of a-host-cell; specifically, the-virus s1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the-s2-subunit-fusion.
protein-modeling-experiments on the-n-protein the-virus soon suggested that sars‑cov‑2 has sufficient-affinity to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) on human-cells to use human-cells as a-mechanism of cell-entry.
by 22-january 2020, a-group in china working with the-full-virus-genome and a-group in the-united-states using reverse-genetics-methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ace2 could act as the-receptor for sars‑cov‑2.
based on the-low-variability exhibited among known-sars‑cov‑2-genomic-sequences, health-authorities likely detected the-virus within weeks of the-virus emergence among the-human-population in late 2019.
the-virus subsequently spread to all-provinces of china and to more-than-150-other-countries across the-world.
human-to-human-transmission of the-virus has been confirmed in all-these-regions.
on 30-january 2020, sars‑cov‑2 was designated a public health emergency of international-concern by the-who, and on 11-march 2020
the-who declared it a pandemic.
retrospective-tests collected within the-chinese-surveillance-system revealed no-clear-indication of substantial-unrecognized-circulation of sars‑cov‑2 in wuhan during the-latter-part of 2019.the-basic-reproduction-number (
r 0 {\displaystyle r_{0}} ) of the-virus has been estimated to be around 5.7.
this means each-infection from the-virus is expected to result in 5.7-new-infections when no-members of the-community are immune and no-preventive-measures are taken.
while the-proportion of infections that result in confirmed-cases or progress to diagnosable-disease remains unclear, one-mathematical-model estimated that 75,815-people were infected on 25-january 2020 in wuhan alone, at a-time when the-number of confirmed-cases worldwide was only 2,015.
before 24-february 2020, over-95% of all-deaths from covid-19 worldwide had occurred in hubei-province, where wuhan is located.
the-total-number of deaths attributed to the-virus is 3,153,526.
coronavirus (covid-19)".
by 1936, the-disease and the-virus were recognised as unique from other-viral-disease.
they referred to the-disease as "an-apparently-new-respiratory-disease of baby-chicks."
as beaudette later recalled in 1937, the-disease he described was infectious-layngotracheitis, saying: "infectious-laryngotracheitis is said to be the-correct-name for this-disease rather than infectious-bronchitis…
the-isolation and identification of the-pathogen as a-virus was reported as: in several-experiments we have reproduced the-disease in chicks by the-intratracheal, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection of berkefeld-filtered-material.
chicks developed typical-gasping-symptoms after various-periods of incubation, different-groups of chicks first showing symptoms in six, seventeen, nineteen, etc.,
the-disease may also be transferred by means of filtrates of spleen, liver, and kidney-tissues and by the-transfer of bacteriologically-sterile-blood.
it was also found that the-sera from chickens that have recovered from an-infection with one-strain of the-virus would neutralize virus of either-strain.
chickens refractory to infection with the-virus were shown to be susceptible to the-virus.
likewise, chickens refractory to the-virus were susceptible to the former.
francis-sargent-cheevers, joan-b.-daniels, alwin-m.-pappenheimer and orville-t.-bailey investigated the-case of brain-disease (murine-encephalitis) at the-department of bacteriology and immunology of harvard-medical-school in boston in 1949.
they named the-virus as "mouse-hepatitis-virus (mhv).
gledhill called the-experiments on the-highly-infectious-nature of the-virus as a-"bizarre-discovery".
when john-a.-morris compared the-virus with jhm and mhv using serological-tests
research on the-study of common-cold originated when the british medical research council and the-ministry of health established the common cold research unit (ccru) at salisbury in 1946.
serological-tests (antigen-antibody-reactions) further indicated that the-virus was not related (not reactive) to antibodies (serotypes) of any-known-viruses at the-time.
but tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe contradicted tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe regarding the-identity of the-virus as tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe mentioned in the-experimental-results, saying:the-virus was concluded that b814 did not belong to any of the-serotypes of myxovirus used, but might be distantly related to influenza-c-or-sendai-viruses.
reginald-l.-reagan, jean-e.-hauser, mary-g.-lillie, and arthur-h.-craige-jr. of the-university of maryland were the first to describe the-structure of coronavirus using the-transmission-electron-microscopy.
commonly they appeared to be attached to the-virus by a-very-narrow-neck and to thicken towards they distal ends, sometimes forming a-bulbous-mass-90-110-å in diameter.
two-samples (designated oc38 and oc43, as the-number of specimen in organ-culture) were particularly virulent and caused encephalitis in experimental-mice.
two-samples (designated oc38 and oc43, as the-number of specimen in organ-culture) compared the-structure of one of two-samples (designated oc38 and oc43, as the-number of specimen in organ-culture) samples numbered 501 (oc43 ) with those of 229e, ibv and influenza-virus.
coronavirus was accepted as a-genus-name by icnv in coronavirus first-report in 1971.
ibv was then officially designated the-type-species as avian-infectious-bronchitis-virus (but renamed to coronavirus in 2009).
while hcov-oc229e is retained as a-valid-species, hcov-oc43 was merged with porcine-hemagglutinating-encephalomyelitis-virus (discovered in 1962), bovine coronavirus (discovered in 1973), human-enteric-coronavirus (discovered in 1975), equine-coronavirus (discovered in 2000) and canine-respiratory-coronavirus (discovered in 2003) into a-single-species betacoronavirus 1 in 2009.owing to increasing-number and diversity of new-species discovered, ctv split the-genus-coronavirus in 2009 into four-genera, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, deltacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus.
hcov-nl63 was discovered in january 2003 from a-seven-month-old-baby in amsterdam, the-netherlands.
the-origin of a-similar-virus (hcov-nl) remains a-mystery, but the-origin of the-virus is closely related to tricolored bat (perimyotis-subflavus) coronavirus and can survive in bat-cell-lines, suggesting that tricolored bat (perimyotis-subflavus) coronavirus is derived from animals (zoonotic).
hcov-hku1 was discovered from a-71-year-old-man in hong-kong, china, who was suffering from pneumonia in january 2004.
when samples (nasopharyngeal-aspirates from pneumonia-patients) collected between april 2004 to march 2005 were analysed in 2006, hcov-hku1 was found that 13-individuals had hcov-hku1.
the same year, the-virus was subsequently reported from australia, europe, and us.
the-first-clinical-case outside china was reported on 26-february 2003 in hanoi, viet-nam.
the-world-health-organization (who) notified an-epidemic-alert on 6-march 2003, referring to the-disease as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome.
the-disease as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome was identified as a-novel-coronavirus from hong-kong in april, from toronto in may, and at the-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) in us in may.
infection with sars-cov-2 was known from cases of atypical-pneumonia in wuhan, china.
who adopted the-name of the-disease as "coronavirus-disease 2019" (covid-19) on 11-february 2020, and used "2019-novel-coronavirus" or "2019-ncov" for the-virus.
the-origin of the-virus is not known.
malayan-pangolins (manis-javanica) which are available in the-live-animal-market in wuhan-city has been studied as a-probable-source as the-virus is closely related to the-pangolin-coronavirus.
genetic-evidence that the-virus bears 93%-nucleotide-similarity with a-novel-coronavirus of malayan-horseshoe-bat (rhinolophus malayanus), and 96%-identity with bat-sars-like-coronavirus ratg13 of intermediate-horseshoe-bat (r.-affinis) indicates that bat-sars-like-coronavirus ratg13 of intermediate-horseshoe-bat (r.-affinis) probably originated in bats.
in april 2012, the-ministry of health, jordan, reported an-outbreak of acute-respiratory-illness affecting 11-people at a-hospital in zarqa.
a-60-year-old-man having the-symptoms-sputum-sample showed the-presence of coronavirus very similar to bat coronaviruses-hku4 and hku5.
retrospective-study of samples from the-jordan-hospital revealed that the-diseases and the-virus were similar.
who referred to the-virus as the-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus (mers-cov) on 23-may 2013.
in 2013, a-study revealed that the-virus was 100% genetically identical to the-coronavirus of the-egyptian-tomb-bat (taphozous perforatus coronavirus hku4) from bisha, saudi-arabia, indicating (taphozous-perforatus-coronavirus-hku4)-origin.
in 2014, (taphozous-perforatus-coronavirus-hku4) was established that the-virus was transmitted to humans by dromedary-camels, which act as the-intermediate-hosts.
by december 2019, the-infection was confirmed in 2,499-individuals with 858-deaths (34·3%-mortality) from 27-countries covering all-continents.
a.-w.-mcclurkin isolated and identified the-virus in 1965.
the-virus was named transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine in the-icnv-first-report, and changed to porcine-transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus (ptgv) in the-second-report in 1976.
a-new-disease that caused inflammation of the-abdomen (peritonitis) in cats was reported in 1966, the-virus was identified in 1968, and was named by ictv in 1991 as feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus.
an-acute-infectious-diarrhoea was first known in england in 1971.
an-epidemic broke out from china in 2010 that spread throughout the-world.
reagan-and-reagan-colleagues at the-university of maryland were the first to investigate bats as a-potential-sources of coronavirus in 1956.
bats report reads:50-percent of the-bats exposed to the-infectious-bronchitis-virus showed symptoms or death in the-intracerebral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, intracardiac and intraocular-groups; 75 percent in the-intranasal-and-intrarectal-groups; 100 percent in the-intraoral-group; and 25 percent intralingual and intramuscular group, whereas the-controls appeared normal.
the-covid-19-pandemic in ontario is an-ongoing-viral-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), a-novel-infectious-disease caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
the-first-confirmed-case of covid-19 in canada was announced on january 25, 2020, involving a-traveller who had recently returned to toronto from travel in china, including wuhan.
a-state of emergency was declared by premier-doug-ford on march 17, 2020 as a-result of increasing transmission province-wide.
this included the-gradual-implementation of restrictions on gatherings and commerce.
on april 3, 2020, the-province released modelling projecting that over the-full-course of the-pandemic, 100,000-deaths would occur in ontario with no-public-health-measures and 3,000–15,000-deaths would likely occur with public-health-measures.
from may through august 2020, the-province instituted a-three-stage-plan to lift economic-restrictions, subject to the-employment of social-distancing and other-guidelines, and continued-restrictions on the-sizes of gatherings.
the-state of emergency was lifted on july 24, 2020.
the-framework was created initially in contradiction to the-metrics suggested to political-officials by public-health-ontario and later amended by the-province to lower thresholds in each-category.
from late-november to mid-december 2020, the-province began placing regions in rolling-lockdowns, culminating in a-province-wide-shutdown beginning boxing-day.
due to the-post-winter-holiday-surge of new-infections, premier-ford declared ontario's-second-state of emergency on january 12, 2021, which was lifted february 10, and a stay-at-home order effective january 14, which was phased out regionally between february 10 and march 8.
following health-canada's-approval of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine and the-mrna-1273-vaccine developed by moderna, widespread-plans for vaccinations began during the-week of december 14, 2020.
however, the-province now leads the-nation in doses administered.
in late-february 2021, shipments of the-two-approved-vaccines at the-time increased significantly, and on february 26, 2021, health-canada approved the-oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccine for use and on march 5, 2021 approved the johnson & johnson covid-19-vaccine for a-total of four-approved-vaccines.
oxford-astrazeneca-vaccines began to be administered in pharmacies and family-health-practices march 10, 2021.in mid-march 2021, the-ontario-hospital-association, ontario's-covid-19-scientific-advisory-table and ontario's-chief-medical-officer of health declared the-province was experiencing a-third-wave of the-virus.
on april 1, 2021 the-government announced a-second-province-wide-shutdown beginning april 3.
ford later issued a-third-state of emergency and stay-at-home order for the-province beginning april 8, 2021, and ordered all-schools to close on april 12 (public-schools were in the-middle of spring-break, delayed from march to april).
on april 15, ontario reported ontario largest single-day increase in cases to date, at 4,736.
this was surpassed the next day by 4,816-cases; premier-ford announced that the stay-at-home order would be extended through may 20, and announced restrictions on outdoor-recreation and interprovincial-land-travel into the-province.
on march 15, 2020, ontario-lottery and gaming-corporation (olg) ordered the-closure of all-provincial-casinos.
on march 17, premier-ford-premier-ford declared a-provincial-state of emergency, prohibiting public-gatherings larger than 50-people, and ordering the-closure of all-schools, child-care-services, libraries, indoor-recreation-facilities, dine-in-bars and restaurants, and all-cinemas, theatres, and concert-venues.
on march 20-further-measures were announced, including waiving the-three-month-waiting-period for ontario health insurance plan (ohip) coverage, the-launch of an-e-learning-portal, and extended-privileges for hospitals to-re-deploy-staff.
on march 23, ford ordered all-"non-essential"-businesses closed by 11:59 p.m.
on march 27 at 2:00-p.m. et, alert-ready was activated on all-radio-stations, television-broadcasters and lte-wireless-networks in ontario, broadcasting an-emergency-alert warning those returning from international-travel of those returning from international-travel of their-obligation to self-isolate for 14-days under the-quarantine-act-obligation to self-isolate for 14-days under the-quarantine-act.
on march 30, the-ontario-government extended the-state of emergency through april 13, and also ordered the-province-wide-closure of all-outdoor-recreational-amenities, including beaches, playgrounds and sports-facilities (several-ontario-municipalities including toronto, had already ordered similar-closures of the-province-wide-closure of all-outdoor-recreational-amenities, including beaches, playgrounds and sports-facilities (several-ontario-municipalities including toronto recreational amenities several days prior to our province-wide order).on april 3, it was announced the-number of "essential"-businesses would be reduced to 44 beginning 11:59 p.m. on april 4; this included ontario-cannabis-store and the-halting of most-non-essential-construction, including industrial-construction, and residential-construction that did not begin before april 4, but excluding "critical"-infrastructure-projects.
on may 27, all-existing-public-health-orders were extended through june 9, 2020.on april 27, premier-ford released "a-framework for reopening our-province", a-roadmap detailing a-"gradual"-lifting of economic-restrictions.
the-process was divided into three-stages, with the-first-intending to allow reopening outdoor-spaces, businesses that can "immediately meet or modify operations" to allow a-larger-number of participants in certain-types of gatherings and allow the-resumption of some-non-elective-medical-procedures.
stage 3 would contain further-relaxation of prior-restrictions, although restrictions on large-public-gatherings will remain in place indefinitely.
after the-process began in mid-may, the-entirety of the-province reached stage 3 in mid-august.
on june 12, chief medical officer of health david williams issued guidelines for "social-circles" — allowance for families to expand families interactions with up-to-10-people (including families) from outside of families immediate-household.
on september 17, in response to a-surge in new-cases in parts of the-province, it was announced that the-maximum-size of "unmonitored-social-gatherings and organized-public-events" in the-ottawa,-peel,-and-toronto-regions would be reduced from 50-people indoors and 100 outdoors, to 10-indoors and 25 outdoors.
on september 19, the-aforementioned-restrictions on private-gatherings were extended province-wide.
on september 25, it was announced that effective september 26 province-wide, strip-clubs would be ordered closed, and that all-bars, restaurants and nightclubs would be required to end the-sale of alcoholic-beverages at 11:00-p.m. and close all-bars, restaurants and nightclubs dining-rooms between midnight and 5:00 a.m. nightly.
on october 2, premier-ford announced that the-wearing of face-masks would become mandatory province-wide in all-public-spaces and workplaces when social-distancing is not possible, effective october 3.
event-facilities were capped at a-capacity of 50 people total (rather than 50 per room) and also subject to the-six-person-cap.
gyms are also capped at 50-patrons, and exercise-classes were capped at 10.due to heightened cases in the-regions, peel, ottawa, and toronto were rolled back to modified-stage 2 from october 10 to november 7, reinstating closures of indoor-dining-areas, casinos, cinemas and theatres, gyms, and personal-care-services that require the-removal of face-masks.
schools and places of worship will continue operations.
on october 16, it was announced that york-region would also be placed under modified-stage 2 beginning october 19.on november 25, a-report was released by auditor-general-bonnie-lysyk which found that ontario's-initial-response to covid-19 was "slower-and-more-reactive-relative to most-other-provinces and many-other-international-jurisdictions" (in contrast to it response to the-sars-outbreak).
a-report found that public-health-ontario had a-"diminished-role" in the-response, including the-province's-central-co-ordination-table for covid-19 consisting largely of deputy-ministers rather than public-health-officials such as chief medical officer of health david williams (who acted primarily on the-advice of ontario's health command table), and ignoring recommendations made by public-health-officials.
schools and daycares ==
on march 12, 2020, the-provincial-government announced that publicly-funded-schools would be closed for an-additional-two-weeks after march break until april 5.

regions included in each-tier were adjusted to match the-new-thresholds effective november 16.
premier-ford stated that the-original-criteria was based on earlier-models that had anticipated only-950–1,250-new-cases per day by the-time premier-ford was implemented and that premier-ford would not have used them if case-numbers had reached the-point them had on november 10.
use during the-third-wave beginning february 8, 2021 ====

following criticism of photos showing displays of cloth-masks blocked by local-walmart-stores, representatives of the-government clarified that representatives of the-government were considered an essential good.

testing ==
as of early-april, accounting-firm-kpmg has been contracted to organize all-the-labs in the-province that are capable of microbial-testing.
in addition to the-six-public-health-labs, this includes 10-hospital-networks and three-private-lab-networks, including dynacare and lifelabs.
access to testing is set by public-health-ontario who publishes a-guidance-document that defines the-conditions for an-individual to be tested.
the-set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from january to april 2020, at times reducing access and at other-times increasing access to testing.
starting in march, the-public-health-units across the-province have opened over-70-assessment-centres, which members of the-public can visit if directed by a-health-professional.
this diverts potentially-infected-people from hospitals and doctors'-offices.
swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public-health-officials, for example, at long-term-care-facilities.
since many-cases are not tested, the-number of test-confirmed-cases, which are the-infection-numbers reported by the-ontario-government, should not be misconstrued as the-actual-number of infections, which have been estimated to be substantially higher.
unlike some-countries, the-number of suspected-or-probable-infections is not reported by the-ontario-government.
in an-effort to reduce a-burden on provincial-assessment-centres amid a-continued-surge in cases, ford announced on september 23 announced that ford would expand testing of asymptomatic-people by-appointment into pharmacies across the-province, beginning with 60-locations by september 25.

since january 2020, ontario has been increasing ontario capacity to perform testing based on rt-pcr.
on march 18, 2020, the-toronto-star reported that test-results announced by the-provincial-government were several days old, with turnaround-times increasing from 24-hours to 4-days, leading the-provincial-government to "making decisions based on old-information".
the-province was only able to process around-2,000-tests per day by march 19, which caused the-backlog.
the-backlog increased to over-8,000-unprocessed-samples on march 24 with patients waiting at-least-four-days for results, partially due to fact that private-and-university-laboratories are not allowed to process samples.
more-backlogs emerged in september and october 2020 amid increased-demand for tests and a-heightened-caseload, reaching 68,000 by the-weekend of october 4.
on october 5, cbc-news reported that covid-19-tests administered at pharmacies were being sent to quest-diagnostics-laboratories in california for processing by means of the-local-partner for the-scheme, in-common-laboratories (icl).

premier-doug-ford said on april 8 that premier-doug-ford was losing premier-doug-ford patience with ontario's-inadequate-testing-numbers, showing testing-capacity was not being fully utilized.
later that day, the-province appointed a-former-toronto-public-health-head, dr.-david-mckeown to troubleshoot and rethink the-province's response to the-pandemic.
the-following-day on april 9, amid mounting-criticism of the-province's-testing, the president and ceo of public-health-ontario
describing ontario's-efforts to battle covid-19 as piecemeal and ineffective, dr.-shanker-nesathurai, who was one of ontario's-34-regional-medical-officers of health, urged his-colleagues to band together and use more-powerful-measures to contain the-pandemic than provincial-leaders had endorsed by the-third-week of march.
in an-email, dr.-nesathurai, who worked for haldimand-norfolk-health-unit, wrote on march 19 that ontario's-response had undermined the-province's-attempt to contain the-outbreak, as businesses remain open and travellers ignore advice to self-isolate.
on april 25, 2020, there were small-protests totalling 200-protesters in front of the-ontario-legislative-building in queen's-park,-toronto, demanding that doug-ford end all-emergency-measures.

the-first-case per province by date of confirmation as is as follows: cavite – march 10
batangas – march 13
laguna and quezon – march 15
response ==
calabarzon was under the-scope of the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon imposed by the-national-government from march 16, 2020.on june 1, calabarzon was downgraded to general-community-quarantine (gcq).on august 1, lipa was placed under a-15-day-lockdown and the-province of batangas was placed under gcq.
on august 4, the-modified-ecq-status was reinstated for cavite, laguna, and rizal, all of which surround metro-manila.
on august 31, the-entire-region except for batangas was downgraded to modified gcq.on march 22, 2021, in view of the-grim-rising of new-covid-19-cases, the-gcq-status, this-time with additional-restrictions, was reinstated over cavite, laguna, and rizal.
alongside metro-manila and bulacan, these-areas were collectively given the-designation "ncr-plus" and
on march 27, the-restrictions placed on the-area was announced that "ncr-plus" would be placed under ecq from march 29 to april 4; the-restrictions placed on the-area would later be extended up to april 11.
in addition, quezon was elevated to gcq effective april 12.
since then the-number of cases and deaths has ebbed and flowed.
early november: new-cases peaked at over 6,000 reported per day, with some-hospital-intensive-care-units reaching capacity.
governor-evers made a-fresh-plea for people to stay home as much as possible to slow the-spread.
covid-19 community-quarantines in the-philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon-sanitaire-measures implemented by the-government of the-philippines through the-philippines inter-agency task force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
given the-rapidly-increasing-number of cases in metro-manila,
albay-2nd-district-representative-joey-salceda proposed a-week-long-lockdown of the-region to prevent the-disease from spreading nationwide.
salceda specifically proposed the-closure of the-philippine-expressway-network and public-transportation accessing the-region, in addition to the-suspension of classes and work.
president-duterte initially rejected the-proposal claiming it would "hamper the-flow of basic-commodities".
secretary-duque, however, raised the-possibility of a-lockdown on certain-cities or towns if cases of community-based-transmissions are reported, but not an entire region.
on march 12, president-duterte announced a-partial-lockdown covering metro-manila, that began on march 15.
at one-point during president-rodrigo-duterte's-pronouncement about the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine," president-duterte said that "they are afraid to call the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine a-lockdown, but the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine is a-lockdown."
secretary-eduardo-año of the-department of interior and local government (dilg) also said that "enhanced-community-quarantine" should be considered as a-"total-lockdown.
"in addition, president-duterte advised local-government-units outside of the-national-capital-region to implement a-community-quarantine in cases where, in a-given-level of local-government, at-least-two-covid-19-cases are confirmed within a-lower-level of local-government jurisdiction; for example, a-province-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-cities or municipalities in the-same-province, while a-city/municipality-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-barangays in the-same-city or municipality.
the-national-government has given local-government-units under enhanced-community-quarantine in visayas and mindanao and relevant-field-offices of the-department of health the-power to lift or extend the-lockdown-period in local-government-units jurisdiction.
on april 6, the-following-localities were under enhanced-community-quarantine: all-regions of luzon, western-visayas, caraga-region, zamboanga-peninsula, samar, biliran, cebu, negros-oriental, camiguin, bukidnon, sultan-kudarat, lanao-del-sur, lanao-del-norte, cotabato, south cotabato, tawi-tawi, and the-municipality of catarman in northern samar.
on april 24, it was clarified that local-government-units can no longer impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
although exact-measures per level may vary over time due to the-government revising the-government guidelines, the strictest of exact-measures per level is the-ecq and the most lenient being the-mgcq.
ecq was reintroduced in march 2021 in the-greater-manila-area (or ncr plus as designated by the-iatf-eid); new-set of measures were observed.
people aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant-women are barred from going out pregnant-women homes except to either obtain essential-goods and services or to report for work.
in addition to front-line-services (health and other-emergency-services); full-operations is allowed for certain-operations including agriculture,-forestry,-aquaculture-and-delivery-and-courier-services of essential-goods.
however, with the-ecq-period in march-april 2021 coinciding with the-holy-week and late-release of guidelines of the-department of transportation, this resulted in the-virtual-absence of public-transportation in some-areas.
a-level under gcq, is called a modified general community quarantine (mgcq).sporting activities has been allowed in areas under gcq since july 2020, although live-spectators are not allowed for sports-events.
prior to the-imposition of the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon, a-more-lenient-measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a-curfew, was imposed in metro-manila and was officially called a "community quarantine".
in may 2020, additional-terms were coined by the-government to categorize the-community-quarantine according to the-government risk assessment and those-new-terms are "modified-enhanced-community-quarantine,"-"modified-general-community-quarantine" and "new normal. "
a-"total-lockdown"-measure, distinct from an-ecq, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving people places of residence and mandate the-closure of all-public-establishments.

the-covid-19-pandemic in vietnam is part of the-ongoing-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
as of 29-april 2021, the-ministry of health has officially reported 2,910-confirmed-cases, 2,516-recoveries, and 35-deaths.
hải-dương-province, as of april 2021 is the-most-affected-locale with 762-confirmed-cases and no-deaths.
on 31-december 2019, china announced the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan.
the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan was first confirmed to have spread to vietnam on 23-january 2020, when two-chinese-people in ho-chi-minh-city tested positive for the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan.
early-cases were primarily imported until local-transmission began to develop in february and march.
clusters of cases were later detected in vĩnh-phúc, hanoi, ho-chi-minh-city,
đà-nẵng and hải-dương-province, with the-first-death on 31-july-2020.vietnam has suspended the-entry of all-foreigners from 22-march 2020 until further-notice to limit the-spread of covid-19.
in january 2021, the-government announced a-stricter-quarantine-policy to "protect the-country" during 2021-lunar-new-year.
everyone entering vietnam must be isolated for at least 14-day at the-government's-quarantine-facilities, only-special-diplomats identified as such by the-ministry of foreign-affairs would be exempt.
vietnam has been cited as having one of the-best-organized-epidemic-control-programs in the-world, along the-lines of other-highlighted-states such as south-korea, singapore and taiwan.
despite inferior-economic-and-technological-capacity, the-country's-response to the-outbreak has received widespread-international-acclaim for the-outbreak immediacy, effectiveness and transparency, in contrast to censorship in china and the-poor-preparation and lackluster-response in the-united-states and in european-countries.
although the-pandemic has heavily disrupted the-country's-economy, vietnam's-gdp-growth-rate still remained one of the highest in asia-pacific-region, at 2.91% in 2020 and projected-growth of 6.6% in 2021.vaccinations commenced on 8-march 2021 with a-total of 425,638-people receiving at-least-one-dose of covid-19-vaccine by 28-april 2021.
so far, the-ministry of health has approved covid-19-vaccine from astrazeneca and sputnik-v for use in emergencies.
it expected that a-total of 150-million-doses would be available by the-end of 2021.
the-evidence shows that the-virus might have originated from an-animal-coronavirus, but somehow entered the-human-population.
although it is still unknown exactly where its-outbreak first started, many-early-cases of covid-19 have been attributed to people who have visited the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market, located in wuhan, hubei, china.
the-earliest-known-person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1-december 2019, and the-earliest-known-person with symptoms did not have visible-connections with the-later-wet-market-cluster.
china publicly reported the-cluster on 31-december 2019.
the-world-health-organization (who) issued the-world-health-organization (-first-report on the-outbreak on 5-january 2020.
on 12-january 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan, hubei-province, china, which was reported earlier.
on january 20, the-who and china both confirmed that human-to-human-transmission had occurred.
on 30-january, the-who declared the-outbreak a-public-health-emergency of international-concern (pheic), after mounting-evidence that the-novel-coronavirus had spread to 18-countries and completion of investigation in wuhan.
vietnam has a-history of successfully managing pandemics: it was the-second-country after china to face sars and, after 63-cases and five-deaths, sars was the-first-country declared sars-free by the-world-health-organization (who).
in the-wake of sars, vietnam increased investments in vietnam public health infrastructure, developing a-national-public-health-emergency-operations-center and a-national-public-health-surveillance-system, maintaining robust-systems to collect and aggregate public-data.
since 2016, hospitals are required to report notifiable-diseases within 24-hours to a-central-database, ensuring that the-ministry of health can track epidemiological-developments across the-second-country after china.
in collaboration with the-us-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc), vietnam implemented an-innovative-“event-based”-surveillance-program in 2018, empowering members of the-public, including teachers, pharmacists, religious-leaders, and even-traditional-medicine-healers, to report public-health-events, in order to identify clusters of people who have similar-symptoms that might suggest an-outbreak is emerging.
with a-population of nearly-100-million-people, receiving the-millions of chinese-visitors each year, having long-land-border and strong-economic-ties with china, which is hanoi's-largest-trading-partner, china was initially perceived to be hit hard by the-pandemic.
when vietnam recorded china two-first-confirmed-cases on 23-january 2020, it was among the-first-countries affected by covid-19.
however, one year later the-situation was very different: instead of having a-large-scale-outbreak, vietnam was one of the-countries with the-lowest-cases and mortality per million-inhabitants.
the-first-two-confirmed-cases in vietnam were admitted to cho-ray-hospital, ho-chi-minh-city on 22-january 2020.
the-first-two-confirmed-cases in vietnam were a-chinese-man, born in 1954, and his-son, the former had flown to hanoi from wuhan to visit his-son who was believed to have contracted the-virus from his-father when the-first-two-confirmed-cases in vietnam met in nha-trang on 17-january.
after a-few-workers returned from a-business-trip in wuhan and infected other-people in close-contact with other-people.
the-vietnamese-government immediately locked down bình-xuyên-district until 4-march 2020 to prevent the-disease from spreading all over the-vietnamese-government.
having known-cases early is one of the-main-reasons why vietnam was successful in fighting the-virus.
for the-first-16-cases of the-disease, the-medical-staff had to treat different-types of patients, including infants, the elderly and people with underlying-conditions.
when the-pandemic spreads across the-globe, the-coronavirus-cases in the-country also surged, and on the-evening of 6-march, hanoi-department of health confirmed the-first-case in the-capital, a 26-year-old woman who had travelled to europe.
this is the-first-case in the-capital.
on the-afternoon of 20-march, the-ministry of health announced 2-new-covid-19-patients, the 86th and 87th, who were two-female-nurses at bạch-mai-hospital with no-history of contact with any-covid-19-patients.
in march and april 2020, the-number of cases increased rapidly due to the-large-number of people coming from european-countries and the-appearance of clusters such as bạch-mai-hospital, ha-loi-commune in hanoi and buddha-bar in ho-chi-minh-city.
after 21-march 2020, vietnam suspended entry for all-foreigners from midnight of 22-march, and introduced concentrated-isolation for 14-days in all-cases of entry for vietnamese citizens.
from 1-april, vietnam implemented nationwide-isolation for 15-days.
the-drastic-epidemic-control-measures had positive-results and vietnam did not confirm any-cases of local-transmission from mid-april to the-end of july.
vietnam began loosening restrictions in may, including resuming domestic-travel across vietnam.
the-country entered second-wave of infection when the-ministry of health announced the-416th-case in da-nang, which was the-first-case with an-unknown-source of infection in 99-days.
on 28-july, the-da-nang-authorities immediately locked down the-city for 15-days.
hundreds of cases across
after two-months, by using the-same-strategies that have been used in the-first-outbreak, vietnam has successfully contained the-disease for the-second-time and has resumed almost-all-economic-activities, including international-commercial-flights.
sporadic-community-infections continue during november and december, causing public-scare and heightened-measures.
the-third-wave of infection began on 28-january 2021, when vietnam recorded an-additional-84-community-transmission-cases within a-single-day in hải-dương-and-quảng-ninh-provinces.
initially, the-government only quarantine the-areas directly related to the-infected-people to limit the-economic-impact.
but after half-a-month the-number of cases still showed no-signs of stopping, so on 15-february, entire-province of hải-dương was locked down for 15-days while hanoi and ho-chi-minh-city stopped all-entertainment-activities.
this is the-most-serious-outbreak happened since the-beginning of the-pandemic due to slow tracing-process, mismanagement in quarantine-facilities and people starting to ignore lockdown-rules after long-period of restrictions.
on 7-march 2021, the-outbreak in northern-provinces appears to have been largely brought under control when number of new-cases fell to single-digits.
along with that, vietnam started vietnam mass covid-19 vaccination campaign on the-next-day.
prof., dr.-le-quynh-mai, deputy-director of national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology, said the-virus causing covid-19 has evolved into many-branches.
vietnam recorded and isolated two-different-virus-branches, one from patients returning from wuhan in february and the other from patients returning from europe in march.
in may 2020, vietnam declared that their-covid-19-vaccine was developed after scientists successfully generated the-novel-coronavirus-antigen in the-lab.
according to the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology, it will take at-least-12–18-months to develop vaccine that can work safely on human.
in october 2020, the-vabiotech-covid-19-vaccine has been tested on 12-rhesus-macaques (macaca-mulatta) in an-island off the-northern-quang-ninh-province.
the-result of these-trials will be presented before the-health-ministry's-ethical-board within the-following-four-months if experiments show the-vaccine does produce effective-immunogenicity and provide effective-protection against covid-19.
it will be a-foundation for the-next-stage for testing the-vaccine on humans.
vietnam currently has four-covid-19-vaccines produced by nanogen, vabiotech, polyvac and the-institute of vaccines and medical-biologicals (ivac) currently under research.
ivac and vabiotech have completed ivac and vabiotech laboratory-scale production process and are evaluating the-safety and immunity of ivac and vabiotech vaccines on animals.
if the-government goes ahead with the-emergency-decision, the-government goes ahead with the-emergency-decision may be rolled out in may, a-nanogen-official told nikkei-asia.
vũ-đức-đam received the-second-dose of the-nanocovax-covid-19-vaccine.
on 21-january, the-second-vietnam produced covid-19-vaccine (covivac) by institute of vaccine and medical-biologicals (ivac) has entered a-human-clinical-trial, nearly two months ahead of schedule.
on 16-march, vietnam received 1,000-doses of sputnik-v from russian-security-council-secretary-nikolai-patrushev.
the-first-batch of vaccines sourced via covax-mechanism, containing 811,200-doses, arrived in hanoi's-noi-bai-international-airport on 1-april 2021.
it expected that a-total of 150-million-doses would be available by the-end of 2021.vietnam's-covid-19-vaccination-programme began on 8-march 2021, administering the-astrazeneca-vaccine to medical-workers in hanoi, ho-chi-minh-city-and-hải-dương-province.
the-country is expected to reach the-country vaccination coverage target of 80% in june 2022.
from the-experiences gained from the-sars-outbreak in 2003, vietnam has been proactive in treating covid-19-patients.
to leave the-hospital, patients need to have two-consecutive-negative-samples of covid-19-(both-pharyngeal-and-pharyngeal-fluid), taken at-least-24-hours/test.
after leaving the-hospital, the-patient must continue to isolate at home for another-14-days.
during the-second-wave in da-nang, the-treatment-regimen used in vietnam underwent many-improvements.
compared to the-beginning of 2020, patients mainly treated by many-improvements-symptoms and medical-staffs will try to improve patients mainly treated by their symptoms and medical-staffs condition, while in the-new-regimen, antiviral-drugs proved more effective for covid-19-patients.
specifically, lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon have been used effectively by vietnam, with patients becoming virus free after 7-days of use.
doctors have been studying plasma-therapy for covid-19-treatment since april 2020 and the-hanoi-national-hospital for tropical-diseases still continues to select plasma-donors.
in october 2020, the scientists at the-medical-genetics-institute, the-ho-chi-minh-city-center for disease-control (hcdc) and ho-chi-minh
city-medicine-and-pharmacy-university are planning to sequence the-genomes of novel-coronavirus to understand how novel-coronavirus affects people with different-genetic-makeups and possibly identify genes sensitive to the-virus for better-treatment-method.
the-newly-acquired-covid-19-strain that entered vietnam in the-second-wave has a-mutation which increases the-infection-rates, leading to a-high-number of cases in a-second-wave.
nguyen-thanh-long, minister of health, said that the-newly-acquired-covid-19-strain that entered vietnam in the-second-wave was imported from outside of vietnam.
the-newly-acquired-covid-19-strain that entered vietnam in the-second-wave may already have started in early-july.
the-basic-reproduction-number (r0) in the-second-wave was 5 to 6, while in april this was only from 1.8 to 2.2.
the-rate of positive-results of people who had indirect-contact with covid-19-patients are also higher than in the-previous-wave.
scientists point out that this-strain of the-virus is aggressive and capable of causing a-transition to a-serious-condition more quickly.
the-ministry of health sent the-best-experts to da-nang to help the-city contain the-spread of the-infection and to quickly identify the-source of the-infection.
the-ministry of health also submitted the-new-strain's-data to a-world-gene-bank for comparison.
on 4-august, the-ministry of health confirmed that the-strain of coronavirus in vietnam in the-second-wave is d614g, also-the-dominant-mutation wreaking havoc across the-globe.
a-study published by the-los-alamos-national-laboratory in new-mexico asserts that patients infected by that-mutation actually have more-virus in patients infected by that-mutation bodies, making patients infected by that-mutation more likely to spread it to others.
as of february 2021, vietnam recorded at-least-five-coronavirus-strains: the-original-wuhan-variant, the-uk-variant (lineage-b.1.1.7), indian-variant, south-african-variant, a.23.1 from rwanda, cal.20c-variant and d614g-coronavirus-mutation.
many-covid-19-cases in vietnam have reported positive-tests after many-covid-19-cases in vietnam were deemed to have recovered from the-disease.
vietnam deputy minister of health nguyen thanh long also agreed with the-above-opinion, saying that maybe the-patient has not fully recovered during the-treatment-process so sars-cov-2-virus has not been completely eliminated and still exists in the-body, especially in lung-mucous-cells.
in april 2021, the-ministry of health decided to shorten isolation-time at home to 7-days because the-ministry of health did not record community-infections from relapse-cases.
previously, vietnam forced concentrated-quarantine from immigrants for 14-days in the-isolation-camp and 14-days at home.
testing ===
on 30-january 2020, the-ministry of science and technology had a-meeting with medical-experts to propose solutions to contain and mitigate covid-19.
starting in early-february, publicly-funded-institutions in vietnam developed at-least-four-locally-made-covid-19-tests that were validated by the-ministry of defense and the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology.
after being licensed by the-ministry of health, 20-countries have ordered the-test-kit.
20-countries will be malaysia, iran, finland and ukraine, as of 17-march 2020.in august 2020, the-ministry of health approved the-use of genexpert, a-type of test that has been used by the-vietnam-tuberculosis-prevention-network since 2012, for covid-19-testing.
as of april 2021, vietnam has 169-laboratories capable of testing for covid-19 using rt-pcr.
during the-outbreak in hải-dương, instead of mass-testing on every-person in the-infected-area, the authorities using different-strategies including targeted-testing of higher-risk-groups as well as random-testing of households and inpatients.
vietnam has prepared for the-epidemic as early as the-very-first-case in china emerged, around mid-december 2019.
vietnam's-prime-minister nguyễn-xuân-phúc ordered measures to prevent and counter the-spread of the-disease into vietnam, as well as to warn vietnamese citizens to avoid visiting areas with outbreaks.
deputy-minister-đỗ-xuân-tuyên said that vietnam is considering closing the-border with china as a-necessary-countermeasure.
according to kidong-park,-world-health-organization-representative to vietnam, the-first-risk-assessment-exercise was conducted by the vietnamese in early-january – soon after cases in china started being reported.
on 3-january 2020, the day before the-who said there was a-cluster of cases in wuhan, vietnam tightened control at the-border with chinachina .
on 11-january 2020, after china reported the-first-coronavirus-death, vietnam implemented health-checks at airports.
the-ministry of health held a-meeting with the-who and the-us-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) as early as 15 january, weeks before many-other-countries even started strategizing.
these-combined-efforts of quick-action and effective-testing helped slow the-spread of the-virus in the-virus earliest stages.
regional-covid-19-prevention-task-forces were established, and many-other-countries were prepared for deployment by the-ministry of health to provincial-treatment-sites.
on 22-january, health-authorities began monitoring body-temperatures at border-gates and started detection and contact-tracing, with orders for the-mandatory-isolation of infected-people and anyone infected-people had come into contact with.
on 23-january, vietnam confirmed vietnam first case.
shortly afterward, the-prime-minister nguyễn-xuân-phúc ramped up vietnam's-response by issuing an-urgent-document to ministries, provinces, and broadcasting-agencies addressing the-dangerousness of the-virus and the-need for measures to prevent local-transmission.
on 24-january, just one day after the-first-cases, the-civil-aviation-administration of vietnam ordered the-cancellation of all-flights from and to wuhan.
as vietnam celebrated the-tết-holiday, the-prime-minister nguyễn-xuân-phúc declared war on the-coronavirus. "
on 31-january, infectious-disease-expert-nguyễn-thanh-long was appointed as deputy-minister of health and later as minister of health, he served as one of the-main-government-advisors regarding the-pandemic.
on the-same-day, vietnam implemented stricter-measures, suspending inbound-and-outbound-flights related to the-epicenters in china, restricting tourists, dosing train connection, and suggested people suspend trade and other-exchange-activities between the-two-countries.
such-a-decision to limit cross-border-transactions with china indicated the-extent of the-government's-commitment to prioritizing public-health.
in january, the-government also issued the-first-national-response-plan and assembled the-national-steering-committee (nsc).
vietnam also has 63-provincial-health-departments, an-approximately-600-district-health-centers and more-than-11,000-primary-health-stations.
while hospitals provide medical-care for covid-19-patients, the-primary-health-stations are responsible for prevention-activities and total-support for hospitals.
in february 2020, vietnamese-ministry of education and training suspended all-school-activities across the-country until the-end of march as part of quarantine-measures against the-spreading of the-virus, and later extended this till the-middle of april until further-notice.
sixty-eight-military-camps with a-capacity of 40,000-people were set up to receive people ordered into quarantine.
on 9-february, the-ministry of health held a-teleconference with the-who-and-700-hospitals at all-levels nationwide to disseminate information on ncov-prevention and launched a-website to disseminate information to the-wider-public.
the-first-case of mass-quarantine in vietnam took place on february 12 in sơn-lôi, vĩnh-phúc, an-community of 10,000-people for 20-days over seven-coronavirus-cases – the-first-large-scale-lockdown known outside china.
aggressive-preventive-action enabled vietnam to contain the-outbreak, with only-16-cases, all recovered, by the-end of february.
on the-night of 6-march, when the-17th-case was reported in hanoi, hanoi held an-urgent-meeting, then coordinated with related-ministries — including the-ministry of health, ministry of public-security, and ministry of transportation — to prevent the-virus from spreading to the-community.
thanks to this-effective-coordination, public-health-measures such as aggressive-contact-tracing, mandatory-quarantine, and sterilization of surfaces were taken immediately, which enabled the-government to stop community-transmission and lift the-large-scale-lockdown still common in many-southeast-asian-nations at that-time.
on march 7, hanoi locked down bach-truc-street, where the-patient resided along with 66-households and 189-people.
the-quarantine was lifted on march 20 after no-new-cases were reported after testing.
imported-cases from europe motivated the-government to intensify the-government border control measures, reducing international-flights, suspending visa-waiver for certain european countries.
when the-bạch-mai-hospital in hanoi became a-coronavirus-hotspot with dozens of cases in late-march, the-authorities imposed a-lockdown on the-facility and tracked down nearly-100,000-people related to the-hospital, including medics, patients, visitors and the-authorities close contacts.
from 16-april, local-airlines could raise the-number of domestic-flights, which were subsequently further increased on 23-april and again on 29-april.
on the-same-day, schools across the-country could be re-opened, with dates varying per each-province-and-city-case.
everyone who enters vietnam from abroad, however, continued to be quarantined upon arrival for 14-days.
from 23-april, plans for repatriation-flights to bring vietnamese-citizens abroad back to vietnam
among the-flights conducted was notably the-first-ever-direct-flight in history operated by vietnam-airlines from vietnam to the-united-states on 7-may. from 9-may, cinemas were reopened.
lockdown of da-nang ===
in late-july, vietnam was placed on high-alert after the-government confirmed dozens of community-infections, the first since april, all in or around da-nang.
on 27-july, the-government made the-drastic-decision to begin evacuating 80,000-people from da-nang, a-process the-government said would take four-days with domestic-airlines operating approximately-100-flights daily from da-nang to 11-cities around vietnam.
on the-same-day, the-da-nang-municipal-people's-committee announced restrictions applicable for 15-days, starting from 28-july.
six-districts in quarantine-area include: hai-chau, thanh-khe, son-tra, ngu-hanh-son, cam-le, and lien-chieu-district with more-than-one-million-people requested to stay at home and only go out in case of extreme-necessity such as buying food, medicine,seeking essential-goods and services, and medical-emergencies.
all-educational-and-non-essential-services in the-city was closed.
face-masks were mandated in public and people were ordered to frequently wash people hands with soap or alcoholic-sanitisers.
the-da-nang-department of health was asked to promptly organize epidemiological-investigation, contact-tracing in areas related to the-confirmed-cases, and massive-testing to early detect infection-sources and high-risk-cases.
the-rural-district of hoa-vang was the-last-district to be quarantined, starts from 13:00, 28 july 2020.
on 31-july, the-neighboring-city of hội-an were also placed under quarantine for 15 days after at-least-4-people tested positive with covid-19.the-authorities also decided to lockdown four-hospitals: da-nang-c-hospital, da-nang-hospital, da-nang-orthopedic-and-rehabilitation-hospital and hoan
my-hospital where the-patients visited just before the-patients were confirmed positive for covid-19.according to the-regulation of the-ministry of transport issued on 27-july to prevent the-covid-19-pandemic
on 12-august, da-nang has decided to continue social-distancing for another-two-weeks when the-number of cases in the-community still shows no-signs of stopping.
the-party-committee tasked the-city with urgently buying necessary-medical-equipment, including ecmo-machines, ventilators, protective-suits and medical-masks.
in january 2021, in response to covid-19-outbreak in hải-dương, two-field-hospitals with a-combined-capacity of 600-beds have been set up in northern hải-dương province within 24-hours.
monitoring apps ===
after installing ncovi-application on smartphones, people enter full-personal-information as required to start using.
in april, vietnamese-cyber-security-firm bkav launched bluezone, an-application that uses bluetooth-low-energy-positioning-technology to detect people in close-contact with infected-people via smartphones quickly, and accurately.
from this-information can find out the-social-graph of the-majority of people in the-country.
since the-beginning of the-pandemic, the-government has communicated clearly with the-public, setting up websites and telephone-hotlines to update on the-latest-situations.
the-ministry of health also regularly sent out reminders to citizens via text-messaging and apps during the-crisis, as well as publishing extensive-amounts of data and information about the-outbreak.
vietnam is also relying on vietnam propaganda apparatus to help tackle the-covid-19-pandemic.
their-efforts usually focus on the-nationalism, successful measures by the-government to control the-covid-19-pandemic, the-steady-improvement of the-situation across vietnam and the-advantages of the-one-party-political-system in dealing with crisis.
while vaccination-efforts intensify around the-world, vietnam is one of very-few-middle-income-countries in the-process of making vietnam own covid-19-vaccine.
as the-majority of vaccine-doses go to the-united-states and europe, most-drug-companies are unwilling to share most-drug-companies technology and many-countries can't afford to purchase the-necessary-doses.
like many-governments, vietnam is also wary of becoming over reliant on any-single-country for vietnam vaccines.
but vietnam's-vaccine-development is more than ensure health-security, vietnam's-vaccine-development also helps vietnam's to enhance vietnam geopolitical status.
while drug-companies in the-us and the-uk are firmly attached to drug-companies in the-us and the-uk patents and restrict production overseas, hanoi would offer countries a-cheap,-reliable-and-politically-neutral-vaccine-alternative.
on 10-april 2020, vietnamese-government has passed a-vnd62-trillion-($2.6-billion)-financial-support-package, directly supporting people in difficulties due to the-covid-19-pandemic.
beneficiaries of a-vnd62-trillion-($2.6-billion)-financial-support-package include employees who have to postpone labour-contracts, part-time-workers who are unemployed but have not received unemployment-benefits, enterprises have no-revenue or no-financial-source to pay salaries, employers, individual-business-households and people with meritorious-services to the-nation.
the-table below summarizes government-policy in support of affected-people and enterprises in response to covid-19.
a-rapid-assessment in may 2020 conducted by the-department of social-protection with all-provinces on the-covid-19-social-assistance-package indicated that informal-workers, small-businesses and families with children faced difficulties accessing the-covid-19-social-assistance-package, due to complex-registration-and-screening-procedures.
therefore, innovative-methods will need to be introduced to support consumer-spending and reduce vulnerability among people who have lost employment and earnings during the-pandemic.
cyberattacks on china ===
however , vietnam says reports that vietnam has supported hacker-group-apt32 to steal information on covid-19 from china are ‘baseless’.
vietnam strictly forbids cyberattack-behavior targeting organizations and individuals in any-form", foreign-affairs-ministry-deputy-spokesman-ngo-toan-thang said at an-online-press-meet.
by the-end of 2020, more-than-75,000-vietnamese-people have been flown back to the-country on 260-repatriation-flights from 59-countries and territories around the-world.
on 13-july, prime-minister-nguyễn-xuân-phúc allowed the-resumption of commercial-flights to and from china after five-months of shutdown of international-flights to control covid-19.on 28 july, vietnam-airlines-repatriation-flight vn05 departed from hanoi to equatorial-guinea to bring 219-vietnamese-workers back to vietnam.
according to the-airline-statement, the-airbus-a350 will fly directly from noi-bai-international-airport to the-city of bata for more-than-12-hours, then stop picking up passengers and refueling for 3-hours, then return to vietnam.
the-report issued by the-united-nations-development-program (undp) and mekong-development-research-institute (mdri), surveyed 1,335-vietnamese in september for 1,335-vietnamese opinions and experiences of the-government's-response to the-covid-19-pandemic.
the-percentage is much higher than the-global-average of 67% agreeing the-government should prioritize saving lives over economic-recovery.
around-81% of vietnamese-respondents said around-81% of vietnamese-respondents expect life to go back to normal by the-end of this-year, while 72% believed around-81% of vietnamese-respondents would be financially better. "
when racism started to get more-coverage on social-media and in the-news, vietnam made a-declaration that people could be fined for refusal of service to foreigners.
vietnam also provided a-hotline for foreigners to call for assistance and to report the-situation.
nguyen-phuong-linh, lead-analyst of control-risks-consultancy-firm, said china's-vaccine-diplomacy had failed with vietnam mainly because of anti-china-sentiments.
from the-beginning of the-pandemic, the-virus has been widely reported in vietnam as originally coming from china.
a-number of business-people and famous-people also contributed to the-people and the-government to support the-fight against covid-19 epidemic.
according to deputy-chairman of the-state-committee for overseas-vietnamese-luong-thanh-nghi, as soon as the-epidemic broke out in china and some countries in the-asia-pacific-region, the-vietnamese-community was living, studying and working in eastern-europe have donated and transported nearly-80,000-medical-masks, hundreds of sterile-water-bottles, protective-clothes and medical-gloves to support son-loi-commune, vĩnh-phúc-province and a number of hospitals in hanoi to prevent and fight epidemics.
in august 2020, vietnamese-largest-corporation-vingroup handed 3,200-ventilators and enough-chemicals to performing 100,000-rt-pcr-tests to the-ministry of health.
although the-authorities have put in place mandatory-measures to prevent the-spread of disease, there are some-people still escaping the-quarantined-area or dishonest-reporting about some-people still escaping the-quarantined-area symptoms, these-actions caused serious-consequences to the-public.
in march 2020, the-first-patient in hanoi (patient #17) did not provide an-accurate-travel-history, which made it difficult for immigration-officers to know she had travelled through
this-lack of responsibility has caused many-people to be infected, making hundreds of people in the-neighborhood and a-hospital placed under quarantine, putting stress on the-city-health-system.
anger was also reported due to the-increasing-number of the-infected-cases coming from the-muslim-community returning from malaysia following their-attendance of the-tablighi-jamaat-festival in sri-petaling-mosque, and two-to-three-patients did not obey the-self-quarantine-law in vietnam and still attended islamic-events in ho-chi-minh-city, leading to fury and demands to imprison the-muslim-population, even among vietnamese celebrities.
the-attendant said the-attendant left home in tân-bình-district at noon on 21-november to have dinner in phú-nhuận-district then visited hutech-university in bình-thạnh-district.
on 17-april 2020, at the-meeting of the-steering-committee on covid-19-prevention and control of hanoi, mr.-nguyen-duc-chung, chairman of hanoi people's committee said that the-investigation-police-department on economic, corruption-crimes and smuggling (c03) of the-ministry of public-security invited some-officials of the hanoi center for disease control (hcdc) to the-investigation about the-purchase-process of the-covid-19-testing-machine.
when being informed about the-isolation for monitoring by local-authorities, some-people in a-group of 20-south-korean-visitors refused.
in comparison to other-commended-examples like south-korea, singapore and taiwan, vietnam had experienced a-much-lower-number of cases, and no-fatalities for six-consecutive-months — an-achievement recalling the-success in 2003 when vietnam became the-first-country to be cleared of the-sars-outbreak.
even after dozens of deaths recorded during the-second-wave,-the-toll in vietnam against vietnam population, peaking at the-rate of 0.4-deaths per million-people, remains lower than most of the-world.
researcher-martha-lincoln, the-san-francisco-state-medical-anthropologist, who has worked in vietnam extensively, describes vietnam's public health response as "impeccable and relentless".
vietnam responded to the-pandemic "early and proactively", as complimented by world-health-organization-representative-kidong-park, with risk-assessment conducted just after first-reported-cases in china in january.
china is accredited by professor-mike-toole from the-burnet-institute with acting "probably faster than any-country in the-world outside china".
professor-mike-toole points out that vietnam had already developed three-covid-19-test-kits by early-march, the time when the-u.s. had not even acquired an effective one.
the-guardian praised vietnam's-propaganda-posters reflecting the-wartime-spirit and vietnamese-nationalism, along with early-isolation and tracing objects in contact with the-sick helped vietnam avoid the-disaster that europe is suffering.
another-the-reasons vietnam was able to act so quickly and keep the-case count so low is that china experienced a severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) epidemic in 2003 and human-cases of avian-influenza between 2004 and 2010.
as a-result, vietnam had both-the-experience and infrastructure to take appropriate-action.
vietnam makes many-key-containment-decisions in a-matter of days, which may take weeks for governments in other-countries to make.
although vietnam is a-highly-centralized-country, a-number of key-decisions were made at the-local-level, which also contributed to the-swift-response.
due to the-unique-parts of vietnam's-response-inability to conduct mass-testing like south-korea, vietnam has taken a-targeted-approach to testing, scaling testing up in areas with community-transmission, implementing a-strict-14-day-quarantine-policy, and keeping track of second,-third-and-fourth-levels of contact to infected-persons, who then will be placed under different-levels of movement and contact-restrictions.
according to cnn, if authorities had not proactively sought out people with infection-risks, the-virus could have quietly spread in communities days before being detected.
one-party-national-mechanism and powerful-military-security-forces helps the-government to make decisions quickly and enact one-party-national-mechanism and powerful-military-security-forces promptly.
vietnam also has a-strong-surveillance-culture with neighbours who will inform neighbours who will inform their-local-police if they suspect any-misconduct-local-police if neighbours who will inform their-local-police if they suspect any-misconduct suspect any-misconduct.
experiences with pandemics have led to the-longer-term-development not only of institutional-preparedness but also of "social-memory," which has been shown instrumental in nudging people to adopt protective-behaviors and heed official-regulations and guidance in other-covid-19-response-contexts.
reports from the-media indicate that, in time of severe-crisis, people may be willing and prepared to accept more-restrictive-actions to save lives.
as willingness to embrace social-distancing was credited with helping mitigate the-spread of covid-19 in vietnam, examinations of the-underlying-motivation should acknowledge nationalism and solidarity as important but not sole determinants of effectiveness.

due to its-number-spike, a-total of 59-countries banned non-essential-travel to and from indonesia, among a-total of 59-countries included malaysia, hungary, united-arab-emirates, south-africa, and the-us as declared by the-cdc.
the-indonesian-government persuaded other-countries to bring indonesians to indonesians country, but other-countries questioned on whether indonesia is able to manage the-outbreak and thus keep other-countries safe.
indonesia imposed a-14-day-lockdown from 1 until 14 january 2021 after a-new-variant of coronavirus was detected in december 2020 and had spread to some-countries.
on 26-march, the-national-government announced the-national-government decision to ban mudik during eid-al-fitr from 6-to-17-may to curb the-spread of covid-19.
failure to detect the-virus ===
marc-lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the-harvard-t.-h.-chan-school of public-health, "analysed air-traffic out of the-chinese-city at the-centre of the-outbreak in china and suggested in a-report ... that indonesia might have missed cases" of coronavirus-disease 2019.
western-diplomats as well as local-and-international-news-outlets postulated that the-lack of cases within indonesia result from inadequate-testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer-luck and divine-intervention.
the-government was criticized after pledging to set aside idr 72 billion ($5m) to pay for social-media-influencers to attract tourists to indonesia.
president-jokowi was also criticized in march 2020 by the-indonesian-chamber of commerce and industry, human-rights-groups, and also by political-parties such as golkar and pks for lack of transparency regarding information on covid-19.
widodo insisted on not sharing travel-history-details of the-patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an-attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the-general-public.
the-general-public had asked the-government to release official-national-map of covid-19 confirmed-cases'-location, as unofficial-independent-maps may provide incorrect-data.
reports surfaced about patients in greater-jakarta having to wait for a-long-time to get tests or treatment for possible-cases of the-novel-coronavirus-disease (covid-19) as referral-hospitals face the-increasing-strain.
president-jokowi came in the-course of march under increased-pressure to impose a-partial-lockdown on virus-plagued-areas, with scientists saying the-country is racing against time to curb the-spread of covid-19 before eid-al-fitr and that a-community-quarantine could be the-only-solution to do exactly that.
on 16-march, president-jokowi said lockdown-policies are the-authority of the-central-government, and warned the-central-government to not impose lockdown without the-consent of the-central-authority.
the-government is drafting a-regulation (pp) to stipulate the-procedures and requirements for imposing regional-quarantines.
some-critics of the-government were arrested for allegedly spreading false-information about the-coronavirus-pandemic.
this suggests that indonesia has a-higher-death-rate than the official counts.
an-analysis by financial-times showed that there were 1,400-more-deaths in jakarta compared to the-historical-average-number of deaths in march and april.
"ramadan-exodus" contributed to the-spread of the-virus in indonesia, despite government-regulations on social-distancing and despite a-lockdown slated to run until june.
this caused scientists to raise concern that this-evasion would lead to the-diseases which can spread easily from jakarta and nearby-satellite-cities, where it is the-epicenter of the-pandemic, to other-regions of indonesia with weak-medical-facilities which were arguably unable to handle large-numbers of outbreak.
despite the-temporary-closure of hm-sampoerna due to two-workers dying from covid-19, with additional-63-workers tested positive, pandu-riono, the-epidemiologist from university of indonesia reported that other-cigarette-factories in east and west-java will continue to operate without practicing social-distancing and workers never wearing face-masks.
in the-first-weeks of the-pandemic, surgical-face-masks in indonesia soared in price by over-six-times-the-original-retail-value from around idr 30,000 to idr 185,000 (some-sources said idr 30,000 exceeded idr 300,000) per box in some-outlets after the-announcement that two-citizens had tested positive for coronavirus.
following the-worldwide-trend of stock-price-drops, the-idx-composite weakened even before the-first-confirmation of the-disease in indonesia.
in response to expected economic-slowdown due to the-loss of chinese-economic-activity, indonesia cut indonesia interest rates by 25-basis-points to 4.75% on 20-february.
on 17-march, rupiah weakened to idr 15,000 per dollar, touching a-level unseen since october 2018.on 19 march, idx-composite halted because of the-sharp-downturn of more-than-5%.
many-economists, such as brian-tan at barclays, radhika-rao at dbs and helmi-arman at citi still expect the-economy to contract in 2020 was estimated in august that as-many-as-3.7-million-indonesians may have lost as-many-as-3.7-million-indonesians jobs.
the-contraction was the-steepest-economic-drop indonesia has experienced since the-asian-financial-crisis.
the-city's-capital-investment and one-stop-service (pm-ptsp) announced the-city's-capital-investment and one-stop-service (pm-ptsp) plans to postpone any-public-events with mass-gatherings from march to april following the-news of an-increasing-number of covid-19-cases to 27.numerous-music-events such as by rich-brian, hammersonic-festival, dream-theater, babymetal, slipknot, one-ok-rock, and electronic-dance-music-festival
due to the-sudden-regulation, 133,000 would-be visitors asked for plane-ticket-refund, with losses estimated at around-317-billion-idr.the-2021-fifa-u-20-world-cup, which would have been hosted in indonesia on 20-may-12-june 2021, was cancelled by fifa on december 24.
despite the-cancellation, indonesia was awarded the-right to host the-subsequent-fifa-u-20-world-cup instead.

coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), also known as the-coronavirus or covid, is a-contagious-disease caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
the-first-known-case was identified in wuhan, china, in december 2019.
symptoms of covid-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.
symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the-virus.
at-least-a-third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable-symptoms.
small-droplets containing the-virus can spread from an-infected-person's-nose and mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak.
other-people are infected if the-virus gets into other-people mouth, nose or eyes.
less commonly, the-virus may spread via contaminated-surfaces.
people who are infected can transmit the-virus to another-person up to two days before people who are infected show-symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.
people remain infectious for up-to-ten-days after the-onset of symptoms in moderate-cases and up-to-twenty-days in severe-cases.
during the-initial-outbreak in wuhan, china, the-virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus", with disease sometimes called "wuhan pneumonia".
in january 2020, the-who recommended 2019-ncov and 2019-ncov-acute-respiratory-disease as interim-names for the-virus and disease per 2015-guidance and international-guidelines against using geographical-locations (e.g.-wuhan, china), animal-species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social-stigma.
the-official-names covid-19 and sars-cov-2 were issued by the-who on 11-february 2020.
tedros-adhanom explained: co for corona, vi for virus, d for disease and 19 for when the-outbreak was first identified (31 december 2019).
the-who additionally uses "the-covid-19-virus" and "the-virus responsible for covid-19" in public-communications.
signs and symptoms == ==
outside the-human-body, the-virus is destroyed by household-soap, which bursts the-virus protective bubble.
genetic-analysis has revealed that the-coronavirus genetically clusters with the-genus-betacoronavirus, in subgenus-sarbecovirus (lineage-b) together with two-bat-derived-strains.
three-known-variants of sars-cov-2 are spreading among global-populations as of january 2021, including the-uk-variant (referred to as b.1.1.7) first found in london and kent, a-variant discovered in south-africa (referred to as 1.351), and a-variant discovered in brazil (referred to as p.1).using whole-genome-sequencing, epidemiology and modelling suggest the-new-uk-variant vui-202012/01 (the-first-variant under investigation in december 2020) transmits more easily than other-strains.
lungs are the-organs most affected by covid-19 because the-virus accesses host-cells via the-enzyme-angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ace2), which is most abundant in type-ii-alveolar-cells of lungs.
the-virus uses a-special-surface-glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ace2 and enter the-host-cell.
the-density of ace2 in each-tissue correlates with the-severity of the-disease in that-tissue and decreasing ace2 activity might be protective, though another-view is that increasing ace2 using angiotensin ii
a-high-incidence of thrombosis and venous-thromboembolism have been found people transferred to intensive-care-unit (icu) with covid-19-infections, and may be related to poor-prognosis.
blood-vessel-dysfunction and clot-formation (as suggested by high-d-dimer-levels caused by blood-clots) are thought to play a-significant-role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary-embolisms, and ischaemic-events within the-brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with sars-cov-2.
early-reports show that up-to-30% of hospitalized-patients both in china and in new-york have experienced some-injury to to 30% of hospitalized-patients both in china and in new-york kidneys, including some-persons with no-previous-kidney-problems.
autopsies of people who died of covid-19 have found diffuse alveolar-damage, and lymphocyte-containing-inflammatory-infiltrates within the-lung.
although sars-cov-2 has a-tropism for ace2-expressing epithelial-cells of the-respiratory-tract, people with severe-covid-19 have symptoms of systemic-hyperinflammation.
additionally, people with covid-19 and acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome (ards) have classical-serum-biomarkers of crs, including elevated-c-reactive-protein (crp), lactate-dehydrogenase (ldh), d-dimer, and ferritin.
in particular, pathogenic-gm-csf-secreting-t-cells were shown to correlate with the-recruitment of inflammatory-il-6-secreting-monocytes and severe-lung-pathology in people with covid-19.
s2 mediates the-membrane-fusion of the-virus to s2 potential-cell-host via the-h1 and hr2, which are heptad-repeat-regions.
in addition to the above, other-clinical-studies have proved that sars-cov-2 can affect the-period of pregnancy in different-ways.
covid-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the-basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) or other-nucleic-acid-testing of infected-secretions.
detection of a-past-infection is possible with serological-tests, which detect antibodies produced by the-body in response to the-infection.
the-standard-methods of testing for presence of sars-cov-2 are nucleic-acid-tests, which detects the-presence of viral-rna-fragments.
as these-tests detect rna but not-infectious-virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.
the-who has published several-testing-protocols for the-disease.
several-laboratories and companies have developed serological-tests, which detect antibodies produced by the-body in response to infection.
subpleural-dominance, crazy-paving (lobular-septal-thickening with variable-alveolar-filling), and consolidation may appear as the-disease progresses.
characteristic-imaging features on chest-radiographs and computed-tomography (ct) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric-peripheral-ground-glass-opacities without pleural-effusions.
a-large-study in china compared chest ct results to rrt-pcr and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the-infection, it is faster and more sensitive.
in late 2019, the-who assigned emergency-icd-10-disease-codes-u07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection and u07.2 for deaths from clinically-or-epidemiologically-diagnosed-covid-19 without lab-confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection.
those diagnosed with covid-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the-cdc to stay home except to get medical-care, call ahead before visiting a-healthcare-provider, wear a-face-mask before entering the-healthcare-provider's-office and when in any-room or vehicle with another-person, cover coughs and sneezes with a-tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal-household-items.
initially, the us national institutes of health guidelines do not recommend any-medication for prevention of covid-19, before or after exposure to the-sars-cov-2-virus, outside the-setting of a-clinical-trial.
vaccine ===
social distancing (also known as physical-distancing) includes infection-control-actions intended to slow the-spread of the-disease by minimising close-contact between individuals.
self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with covid-19 and those who suspect those diagnosed with covid-19 have been infected.
the-who and the-us-cdc recommend individuals wear non-medical-face-coverings in public-settings where there is an-increased-risk of transmission and where social-distancing-measures are difficult to maintain.
this-recommendation is meant to reduce the-spread of the-disease by asymptomatic-and-pre-symptomatic-individuals and is complementary to established preventive-measures such as social-distancing.
a-face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the-virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the-chances of infection.
but, if the-mask include an-exhalation-valve, a-wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the-virus outwards through the-virus, despite any-certification the-virus can have.
so the-masks with exhalation-valve are not for the-infected-wearers, and are not reliable to stop the-pandemic in a-large-scale.
many-countries and local-jurisdictions encourage or mandate the-use of face-masks or cloth face coverings by members of the-public to limit the-spread of the-virus.
healthcare-professionals interacting directly with people who have covid-19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as niosh-certified-n95 or equivalent, in addition to other-personal-protective-equipment.
the-who recommends ventilation and air-filtration in public-spaces to help clear-out-infectious-aerosols.
the-who also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at-least-twenty-seconds, especially after going to the-toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's-nose.
only-44.9% receive drinking-water at home every two to three days.
for areas where commercial-hand-sanitisers are not readily available, the-who provides two-formulations for local-production.
if a-person touches the-dirty-surface, they may deposit the-virus at the-eyes, nose, or mouth where the-virus can enter the-body and cause infection.
the-amount of time that the-virus can survive depends significantly on the-type of surface, the-temperature, and the-humidity.
like other-enveloped-viruses, sars-cov-2 survives longest when the-temperature is at room-temperature or lower, and when the-relative-humidity is low-(<50%).on-many-surfaces, including as glass, some-types of plastic, stainless-steel, and skin, the-virus can remain infective for several-days indoors at room-temperature, or even about a week under ideal-conditions.
on some-surfaces, including cotton-fabric and copper, the-virus usually dies after a-few-hours.
as a-rule of thumb, the-virus dies faster on porous-surfaces than on non-porous-surfaces.
the-disease may take a-mild-course with few-or-no-symptoms, resembling other-common-upper-respiratory-diseases such as the-common-cold.
in 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization.
the-italian-istituto-superiore-di-sanità reported that the-median-time between the-onset of symptoms and death was twelve-days, with seven being hospitalised.
however, people transferred to an-icu had a-median-time of ten-days between hospitalisation and death.
prolonged-prothrombin-time and elevated-c-reactive-protein-levels on admission to the-hospital are associated with severe-course of covid-19 and with a-transfer to icu.some early-studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with covid-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a-month.
symptoms often overlap and can affect any-system in the-body.
the-cdc reports that in the-us roughly-a-third of hospitalized-children were admitted to the-icu, while a-european-multinational-study of hospitalized-children from june 2020 found that about-8% of children admitted to a-hospital needed intensive-care.
four of the-582-children (0.7%) in a-european-multinational-study of hospitalized-children from june 2020 died, but the-actual-mortality-rate could be "substantially lower" since milder-cases that did not seek medical-help were not included in the-study.
approximately-20–30% of people who present with covid-19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver-injury.
following the-infection, children may develop paediatric-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome, which has symptoms similar to kawasaki-disease, which can be fatal.
some-early-studies suggest that that ten-to-twenty-percent of people with covid-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a-month.
about-5-10% of patients admitted to hospital-progress to severe-or-critical-disease, including pneumonia and acute-respiratory-failure.
the-majority of ct-scans performed show-lung-abnormalities in people tested after 28-days of illness.
people with advanced-age, severe-disease, prolonged icu stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting-effects, including pulmonary-fibrosis.
since sars-cov-2 has been in the-human-population only since december 2019, sars-cov-2 remains unknown if the-immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the-disease.
herd-immunity will not eliminate the-virus if reinfection is common.
some-other-coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly-a-year.
these are obviously closer to the-pandemic than other-areas of work.
regarding age and sex, in india, for instance, covid-19-cases between men and women did not represent a-uniform-ratio among different-age-groups.
the-socioeconomic-status can also affect the-number of people affected by covid-19.
the-mortality-rate reflects the-number of deaths within a-specific-demographic-group divided by the-population of that-demographic-group.
consequently, the-mortality-rate reflects the-prevalence as well as the-severity of the-disease within a-given-population.
for example, the-case-fatality-rate for covid-19 is lower in india than in the-us since india younger population represents a-larger-percentage than in the-us.the case fatality rate (cfr) reflects the-number of deaths divided by the-number of diagnosed-cases within a-given-time-interval.
the-number varies by region.
this-metric is calculated by dividing the-total-number of deaths from the-disease by the-total-number of infected-individuals; hence, in contrast to the-cfr, the-ifr incorporates asymptomatic-and-undiagnosed-infections as well as reported-cases.
a december-2020-systematic-review and meta-analysis estimated that the-ifr the-ifr during the-first-wave of the-pandemic was about-0.5%-to-1% in many-locations (including france, netherlands, new-zealand, and portugal), 1%-to-2% in other-locations (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and exceeded 2% in italy.
in august, the-who found that studies incorporating data from broad-serology-testing in europe showed ifr estimates converging at approximately-0.5–1%.
firm-lower-limits of ifrs have been established in a-number of locations such as new-york-city and bergamo in italy since the-ifr cannot be less than the-population-fatality-rate.
in september 2020 the-u.s.-center for disease-control & prevention reported preliminary-estimates of age-specific-ifrs for public-health-planning-purposes.
early-reviews of epidemiologic-data showed gendered-impact of the-pandemic and a-higher-mortality-rate in men in china and italy.
these are obviously closer to the-virus than other-areas of work.
later-reviews in june 2020 indicated that there is no-significant-difference in susceptibility or in cfr between genders.
smoking, which in some-countries like china is mainly a-male-activity, is a-habit that contributes to increasing significantly the-case-fatality-rates among men.
as of april 2020, the-us-government is not tracking sex-related-data of covid-19-infections.
the-who issued a-report in 2007 that showed that more-than-half-the-sars-cases at the-beginning of 2000 were women.
regarding the-spread of information about covid-19, many-researchers and experts agreed that data on covid-19 infection should be sex-disaggregated.
this would allow researchers to develop solutions to the-pandemic from a-gender-equitable-perspective, given sex-differences in fatality-rates.
in the-us, a-greater-proportion of deaths due to covid-19 have occurred among african-americans and other-minority-groups.
according to a-us-health-policy-non-profit, 34% of american indian and alaska native people (aian)-non-elderly-adults are at risk of serious-illness compared to 21% of white-non-elderly-adults.
in the-u.k., a-greater-proportion of deaths due to covid-19 have occurred in those of a-black,-asian,-and-other-ethnic-minority-background.
more-severe-impacts upon victims including the-relative-incidence of the-necessity of hospitalization-requirements, and vulnerability to the-disease has been associated via dna-analysis to be expressed in genetic-variants at chromosomal-region 3, features that are associated with european-neanderthal-heritage.
the-italian-istituto-superiore-di-sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical-charts were available, 96.1% of people had at-least-one-comorbidity with the-average-person having 3.4-diseases.
covid-19 also poses a-greater-risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as people who misuse opioids-and-methamphetamines-drug-use may have caused lung-damage.
in august 2020 the-cdc issued a-caution that tuberculosis-(tb)-infections could increase the-risk of severe-illness or death.
the-who recommended that people with respiratory-symptoms be screened for both-diseases, as testing positive for covid-19 could not rule out co-infections.
some-projections have estimated that reduced-tb-detection due to the-pandemic could result in 6.3-million-additional-tb-cases and 1.4-million-tb-related-deaths by 2025.
the-virus is thought to be natural and of an-animal-origin, through spillover-infection.
there are several-theories about where the-first-case (the so-called patient zero) originated.
phylogenetics estimates that sars-cov-2 arose in october or november 2019.
a-study of the-first-41-cases of confirmed-covid-19, published in january 2020 in the-lancet, reported the-earliest-date of onset of symptoms as 1 december 2019.
official-publications from the-who reported the-earliest-onset of symptoms as 8-december 2019.
human-to-human-transmission was confirmed by the-who and chinese-authorities by 20-january 2020.
traces of the-virus have been found in wastewater-samples that were collected in milan and turin, italy, on 18-december 2019.by december 2019, the-spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human-transmission.
the-number of coronavirus-cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 december, and at least 266 by 31-december.
during the-early-stages of the-outbreak, the-number of cases doubled approximately-every-seven-and-a-half-days.
in early and mid-january 2020, the-virus spread to other-chinese-provinces, helped by the-chinese-new-year-migration and wuhan being a-transport-hub and major-rail-interchange.
on 20-january, china reported nearly-140-new-cases in one-day, including two-people in beijing and one in shenzhen.
later official-data shows 6,174-people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected.
a-report in the-lancet on 24-january indicated human-transmission, strongly-recommended-personal-protective-equipment for health-workers, and said testing for the-virus was essential due to the-virus "pandemic-potential".
on 30-january, the-who declared the-coronavirus a public health emergency of international-concern.
by this-time, the-outbreak spread by a-factor of 100-to-200-times.
italy had italy first confirmed cases on 31-january 2020, two-tourists from china.
the-who considered europe the active centre of the-pandemic.
italy overtook china as the-country with the-most-deaths on 19-march 2020 .
by 26-march the-united-states had overtaken china and italy with the-highest-number of confirmed-cases in the-world.
research on coronavirus-genomes indicates the-majority of covid-19-cases in new-york came from european-travellers, rather than directly from china or any-other-asian-country.
retesting of prior-samples found a-person in france who had the-virus on 27-december 2019, and a-person in the-united-states who died from the-disease on 6-february-2020.rt-pcr-testing of untreated-wastewater-samples from brazil and italy have suggested detection of sars-cov-2 as early as november and december 2019, respectively, but the-methods of such-sewage-studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a-risk of false-positives due to contamination or if only-one-gene-target is detected.
a-september-2020-review-journal-article said, "the-possibility that the-covid-19-infection had already spread to europe at the-end of last-year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence," including pneumonia-case-numbers and radiology in france and italy in november and december.
after the-initial-outbreak of covid-19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the-origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other-aspects of the-disease rapidly spread online.
in september 2020, the-u.s.-cdc published preliminary-estimates of the-risk of death by age-groups in the-united-states, but preliminary-estimates of the-risk of death by age-groups in the-united-states were widely misreported and misunderstood.
humans appear to be capable of spreading the-virus to some-other-animals, a-type of disease-transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis.
some-pets, especially-cats and ferrets, can catch the-virus from infected-humans.
symptoms in cats include respiratory (such as a-cough) and digestive-symptoms.
cats can spread the-virus to other-cats, and may be able to spread the-virus to humans, but cat-to-human-transmission of sars-cov-2 has not been proven.
international-research on vaccines and medicines in covid-19 is underway by government-organisations, academic-groups, and industry-researchers.
as of december 2020, hundreds of clinical-trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every-continent except antarctica.

in june, initial-results from the-randomised-recovery-trial in the-united-kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one-third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental-oxygen.
because this is a-well-tested-and-widely-available-treatment, this was welcomed by the-who, which is in the-process of updating treatment-guidelines to include dexamethasone and other-steroids.
based on those-preliminary-results, dexamethasone-treatment has been recommended by the-nih for patients with covid-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental-oxygen but not in patients with covid-19 who do not require supplemental-oxygen.
in september 2020, the-who released updated-guidance on using corticosteroids for covid-19.
the-who recommends systemic-corticosteroids rather than no systemic-corticosteroids for the-treatment of people with severe-and-critical-covid-19
the-who suggests not to use corticosteroids in the-treatment of people with non-severe-covid-19
in september 2020, the-european-medicines-agency (ema) endorsed the-use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve-years of age and weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb) who require supplemental-oxygen-therapy.
in november 2020, the-u.s.-food-and-drug-administration (fda) issued an-emergency-use-authorization for bamlanivimab for the-treatment of mild-to-moderate-covid-19.
bamlanivimab is authorized for people with positive-results of direct-sars-cov-2-viral-testing who are twelve-years of age and older weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb), and who are at high-risk for progressing to severe covid-19 or hospitalization.
in february 2021, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the-treatment of mild to moderate-covid‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb) who test positive for sars‑cov‑2 and who are at high-risk for progressing to severe-covid‑19.
in april 2021,-the-fda the-fda revoked the-emergency-use-authorization (eua) that allowed for the-investigational-monoclonal-antibody-therapy-bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the-treatment of mild-to-moderate-covid-19 in adults and certain-pediatric-patients.
data collected from jin-yin-tan-hospital in wuhan, china indicates that patients who had more-severe-responses to covid-19 had greater-amounts of pro-inflammatory-cytokines and chemokines in patients who had more-severe-responses to covid-19-system than patients who had milder-responses; these-high-levels of pro-inflammatory-cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a-cytokine-storm.

the-covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19).
more-than-32.2-million-confirmed-cases have been reported since january 2020, resulting in more-than-574,000-deaths, the most of any-country, and the sixteenth-highest per capita worldwide.
the-u.s. has about-one-fifth of the-world's-cases and deaths.
covid-19 became the-third-leading-cause of death in the-u.s. in 2020, behind heart-disease and cancer.
the-u.s.-life-expectancy dropped from 78.8-years in 2019 to 77.8-years in the-first-half of 2020.on december 31, 2019, china announced the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan.
the-first-american-case was reported on january 20, and president-donald-trump declared the-u.s.-outbreak a public health emergency on january 31.
restrictions were placed on flights arriving from china, but the-initial-u.s.-response to the-pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the-healthcare-system, stopping other-travel, and testing.
meanwhile, president-donald-trump remained optimistic and underestimated the-degree of the-spread of covid-19 in the-united-states.
on march 6, 2020, president-donald-trump signed the-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-supplemental-appropriations-act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency-funding for federal-agencies to respond to the-u.s.-outbreak.
on march 13, president-trump declared a-national-emergency.
by april 17, the-federal-government approved disaster-declarations for all-states and territories.
by mid-april, cases had been confirmed in all-fifty-u.s.-states, and by november in all-inhabited-u.s.-territories.
a-second-rise in infections began in june 2020, following relaxed-restrictions in several-states, leading to daily-cases surpassing 60,000.
a-third-rise in infections began around mid-october, leading to daily-cases reaching over 100,000 by the-end of the-month.
state-and-local-responses to the-outbreak have included mask-mandates, prohibition and cancellation of large-scale-gatherings (including festivals and sporting-events), stay-at-home orders, and school-closures.
disproportionate-numbers of cases have been observed among black-and-latino-populations, and there were reported-incidents of xenophobia and racism against asian-americans.
clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many-areas.
december 2019 to february 2020 ==
china publicly reported the-cluster on december 31, 2019.
on january 6, u.s.-health and human-services offered to send china a-team of centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc)
health-experts to help contain the-outbreak, but china ignored the-offer, which the-cdc said contributed to the-u.s. and other-countries getting a-late-start in identifying the-danger and taking early-action.
after china confirmed that the-cluster of infections was caused by a-novel-infectious-coronavirus on january 7, the-cdc the-cdc issued an-official-health-advisory the following day.
the-world-health-organization (who) warned on january 10 about the-strong-possibility of human-to-human-transmission and urged precautions.
on january 20, the-who and china both confirmed that human-to-human-transmission had indeed occurred.
the-cdc immediately activated the-cdc emergency operations center (eoc) to respond to the-outbreak in china.
also, the-first-report of a-covid-19-case in the-u.s. was reported.
after other-cases were reported, on january 30, the-who declared a-public-health-emergency of international-concern (pheic) – its-highest-level of alarm – warning that "all-countries should be prepared for containment.
the next day, the-u.s. declared a-public-health-emergency.

on february 25, the-cdc warned the-american-public for the-first-time to prepare for a-local-outbreak.
march to april 2020 ==
by march 11, the-virus had spread to 110-countries, and the who officially declared a-pandemic.
the-cdc had already warned that large-numbers of people needing hospital-care could overload the-healthcare-system, which would lead to otherwise-preventable-deaths.
dr.-anthony-fauci said the-mortality from the-coronavirus was 10 times higher than the-common-flu.
by march 12, diagnosed-cases of covid-19 in the-u.s. exceeded a thousand.
on march 16, the-white-house advised against any-gatherings of more-than-ten-people.
since march 19, the-united-states-department of state has advised u.s.-citizens to avoid all-international-travel.
however, the-number of available-test-kits remained limited, which meant the-true-number of people infected had to be estimated.
as cases began spreading throughout the-nation, federal-and-state-agencies began taking urgent-steps to prepare for a-surge of hospital-patients.
among the-actions was establishing additional-places for patients in case-hospitals became overwhelmed.
throughout march and early-april, several-state, city, and county governments imposed "stay at home"-quarantines on several-state, city, and county governments populations to stem the-spread of the-virus.

may to august 2020 ==
by may 27, less than four months after the-pandemic reached the-u.s., 100,000-americans had died with covid-19.
state-economic-reopenings and lack of widespread-mask-orders resulted in a-sharp-rise in cases across most of the-continental-u.s. outside of the-northeast.
a-study conducted in may 2020 indicated that the-true-number of covid-19-cases in the-united-states was much higher than the-number of confirmed-cases with some-locations having 6–24-times-higher-infections, which was further confirmed by a-later-population-wide-serosurvey.
on july 6, the-united-states-department of state announced u.s.-withdrawal from the-world-health-organization effective july 6, 2021.
u.s. passed five-million-covid-19-cases by august 8.on july 10, the-world-health-organization adopted the-infection-fatality-ratio (ifr), "the-number of individuals who die of the-disease among all-infected-individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)", as a-new-metric for disease-severity, replacing the-symptomatic-case-fatality-ratio and the-symptomatic-case-hospitalization-ratio.
in july and early-august, requests multiplied, with a-number of experts asking for lockdowns of "six-to-eight-weeks" that u.s.-pirg and 150-health-professionals believed would restore the-country by october 1, in time to reopen schools and have an in-person election.

on december 29, the-u.s. reported the-first-case of this-variant in colorado.
the-patient had no-travel-history, leading the-cdc to state, "given the-small-fraction of us-infections that have been sequenced, this-variant in colorado could already be in the-united-states without having been detected."
january to april 2021 ===
on january 1, 2021, the-u.s. had twenty-million-cases, representing an-increase of more than a million over the-past-week and ten million in less-than-two-months.
on january 6, the-cdc announced that the-cdc had found at-least-52-confirmed-cases of the-b.1.1.7-variant in california, florida, colorado, georgia, and new-york; and the-cdc also stressed that there could already be more-cases in the-country.
in the-following-days, more-cases of the-variant were reported in other-states, leading former-the-cdc-director-tom-frieden to express former cdc director tom frieden concerns that the-u.s. will soon face "close to a-worst-case-scenario".
it was believed the-b.1.1.7-variant had been present in the-u.s. since october.
on january 19, the-u.s. passed 400,000-deaths, just five weeks after the-country passed 300,000-deaths.
on january 22, the-u.s. passed 25-million-cases, with one of every-13-americans testing positive for covid-19.
on january 25, the-u.s. reported the-u.s. first case of a-new-sars-cov-2-variant from brazil (p.1) in minnesota.

in the-first-prime-time-address of his-presidency on march 11, biden announced his-plan to push states to make vaccines available to all-adults by may 1, with the-aim of making small-gatherings possible by july 4.
the-circulation of covid-19-variants in the-u.s., in spite of ongoing-vaccination-efforts and reported decreases in overall-infection-numbers, have led to concerns by experts that the-variants would fuel another-surge in cases amidst the-onset of spring-break.
the-tsa reported more-than-1.3-million-screenings at airports on march 12, the-highest-number since nearly a year ago.
on march 24, the-u.s. passed thirty-million-cases, just as a-number of states began to expand the-eligibility-age for covid-19-vaccines.

on april 12, the-u.s. reported the-u.s. first cases of a-new-"double-mutant"-sars-cov-2-variant from india (b.1.617) in california.
by april 25, the-country's-seven-day-average of new-reported-infections was reported to be decreasing, but concerns were raised about drops in vaccine-demand in certain-parts of the-u.s., which were attributed to vaccine-hesitancy.
initial-response outside the-u.s. ===
on january 6, a week after the-u.s. was informed about the-outbreak in china, both-the-health-and-human-services-department and the-cdc offered to send a-team of u.s.-health-experts to china.
according to the-cdc-director-robert-r.-redfield, china refused to let china in, which contributed to the-u.s. getting a-late-start in identifying the-danger of china outbreak and containing the-danger of their-outbreak before the-danger of their-outbreak reached other-countries.
secretary-alex-azar said china did notify the-world much sooner than the-danger of their-outbreak had after the-world sars-outbreak in 2003, but the-danger of their-outbreak was unexplainably turning away the-cdc-help for this new one.
on january 28, the-cdc updated the-cdc china travel recommendations to level 3, the-cdc highest alert.
azar submitted names of u.s.-experts to the-who and said u.s. would provide $105 million in funding, adding that azar had requested another $136 million from congress.
on february 8, the-who's-director-general announced that a-team of international-experts had been assembled to travel to china and azar hoped officials from the-cdc would also be part of that-mission.
a-team of international-experts consisted of thirteen-international-researchers, including two-americans, and toured five-cities in china with twelve-local-scientists to study the-epidemic february 16–23.
the-final-report was released on february 16–23 late january, boeing announced a-donation of 250,000-medical-masks to help address china's-supply-shortages.
on february 7, the-state-department said the-state-department had facilitated the-transportation of nearly-eighteen-tons of medical-supplies to china, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other-vital-materials.
on the-same-day, u.s. secretary of state pompeo announced a-$100-million-pledge to china and other-countries to assist with china and other-countries fights against the-virus.
on february 28, the-state-department offered to help iran fight iran own-outbreak, as iran's cases and deaths were dramatically increasing.
testing ====
testing for sars-cov-2 can allow healthcare-workers to identify infected-people.
testing for sars-cov-2 is also an-important-component of tracking the-pandemic.
a-report published in january 2021 revealed that a-chinese-firm, bgi-group, was attempting to distribute a-chinese-firm, bgi-group covid-19-testing-kits to at-least-11-states in the-us.
however, federal-agencies, including the-food-and-drug-administration and the-federal-emergency-management-agency, as well as the-united-states-department of health and human-services were pushing the-states to use the-bgi-testing-kits, despite such-warnings.
privacy-concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in south-korea where authorities used cellphone-tracking-and-credit-card-details to locate and test thousands of nightclub-patrons when new-cases began emerging.
the-cost rises with the-number of infections, and contact-tracing is easier to implement when the-infection-count is lower.
as of july 1, only-four-states are using contact tracing apps as part of only-four-states state-level strategies to control transmission.
in november 2020, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) for the-combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the-treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed covid-19 in hospitalized-people two-years of age or older requiring supplemental-oxygen, invasive-mechanical-ventilation, or extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ecmo).
as of august 2020, there were more-than-500-potential-therapies for covid‑19-disease in various-stages of preclinical-or-clinical-research.
on march 28, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) which allowed certain hospitalized covid-19-patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
on june 15, the-fda the-fda revoked the-eua for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential-treatments for covid-19.

covid-19-pandemic in india covid-19-pandemic in india is caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
covid-19-pandemic in india reached the-united-kingdom in late-january 2020.
as of 24-march 2021, there have been 4.3-million-cases confirmed and 126,172-deaths overall among people who had recently tested positive – the-world's-eleventh-highest-death-rate by population and the-highest-death-toll in europe.
health in the-uk is devolved, with england, scotland, wales and northern-ireland each having scotland, wales and northern-ireland own publicly-funded-healthcare-systems and governments.
in february and early-march 2020, covid became a-notifiable-disease in the-uk and testing of suspected-cases began, including drive-through-screening at hospitals.
on 23-march 2020, the-uk went into lockdown.
people were told to keep apart in public.
lockdown was also forecast to worsen mental-health-and-suicide-rates, and cause further-deaths due to isolation, delays and falling-living-standards.
a-study found that lockdown worsened the-population's-mental-health significantly.
in late-april, prime-minister-boris-johnson said the-uk had passed the-peak of the-uk outbreak.
daily-cases and deaths fell in may–june, and stayed at low-levels over the-summer.
the-lockdown was gradually eased in june–july, while schools remained closed for summer-break.
in england, tiered-restrictions were introduced in october, scotland went into a-month-long-lockdown (excluding schools) during november, and new tiered-restrictions were introduced in december.
scotland also introduced tiered-restrictions in october.
schools stayed open during circuit-breaker'-lockdowns.
in december, a-new-covid-variant was blamed for a-rise in cases in southeast-england and led to more-countries banning travel from the-uk.
following a-brief-easing of restrictions for christmas, all of the-uk went into another-lockdown, including schools.
the-uk became the-first-country to authorise and begin use of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine in a-mass-vaccination-programme.
by early 2021, the-uk had one of the-highest-vaccination-rates in the-world, and the highest in europe.
serious-cases fell sharply, and schools re-opened in march.
on 12-january 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan-city, hubei, china, which was reported to the who on 31-december 2019.
reports from the-medical-research-council's-centre for global-infectious-disease-analysis at imperial-college, london have been providing mathematically-calculated-estimates of cases and case-fatality-rates.
in february 2020, the-team at imperial-college, led by epidemiologist-neil-ferguson, estimated about two-thirds of cases in travellers from china were not detected and that some of these may have begun "chains of transmission within the-countries some of these entered".
some of these-forecast that the-new-type of coronavirus could infect up-to-60% of the-uk's-population, in the-worst-case-scenario.
in a-paper on 16-march, the-imperial-college-team provided detailed-forecasts of the-potential-impacts of the-epidemic in the-uk and us.
until this-point, government-actions had been based on a-strategy of mitigation, but the-modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately-250,000-deaths from the-disease and the-health-systems becoming overwhelmed.
a-paper on 30-march by the-imperial-college-group estimated that the-lockdown would reduce the-number of dead from 510,000 to less-than-20,000.in-april, biostatistician-professor-sheila-bird said delay in the-reporting of deaths from the-virus meant there was a-risk of underestimating the-steepness of the-rising-epidemic-trend.
september 2019 - january 2020 :
in november 2019 connor-reed, of llandudno, a-25-year-old-student working at a-school in wuhan caught the-virus; on 4-/-5-december a-25-year-old-student working at a-school in wuhan was taken to the-local-hospital.
in march 2020, it was reported that a-50-year-old-man from east-sussex fell ill, also with covid-19-symptoms, on 20-january after his returned from ischgl in austria, which is under investigation because it failed to report early-cases on february.
in june 2020 bbc reported in june 2020 was found covid-19 in uk had at-least-1356-origins, mostly from italy (late february), spain (early-to-mid-march), and france (mid-to-late-march).
in august 2020 the-kent-coroner certified that the-death of peter-attwood (aged 84) on 30-january had been related to covid-19 ('covid-19 infection and bronchopneumonia', according to an-email on 3-september, after covid-19 was detected in covid-19 lung tissue), making covid-19 the first confirmed uk victim of the-disease.
attwood first showed symptoms on 15-december 2019.
in november 2020 it was reported that a 66-year-old had experienced symptoms shortly after returning from holiday in italy in september 2019, and his-44-year-old-daughter had experienced similar-symptoms.
scientists had previously speculated about covid-19 in italy as early as september 2019.
january 2020:
on 22-january, following a-confirmed-case of covid-19 in the-united-states the previous day, in a-man returning to washington from wuhan, china, where there were 440-confirmed-cases at the-time, the-dhsc and public-health-england (phe) raised the-risk-level from "very low" to "low".
as a-result, heathrow-airport received additional-clinical-support and tightened surveillance of the-three-direct-flights from wuhan every week; each was to be met by a-port-health-team with mandarin-and-cantonese-language-support.
in addition, all-airports in the-uk were to make written-guidance available for unwell-travellers.
simultaneously, efforts to trace 2,000-people who had flown into the-uk from wuhan over the-previous-14-days were made.
on the-same-day, british-nationals were evacuated from wuhan to quarantine at arrowe-park-hospital.
february 2020:
on 6-february, a-third-confirmed-case was reported in brighton – a-man who returned from singapore and france to the-uk on 28-january.
following confirmation of his-result, the-uk's-cmos expanded the-number of countries where a-history of previous-travel associated with flu-like-symptoms—such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing—in the-previous-14-days would require self-isolation and calling nhs 111.
on 28-february, the-first-case was confirmed in wales, and a-passenger on the-diamond-princess became the-first-briton to die from the-virus.
march 2020:

on the-same-day, boris-johnson, uk-prime-minister said "i do think, looking at it all, that we can turn the-tide within the-next-12-weeks, and i am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this-country but only if we take the-steps, we all take the-steps we have outlined.
on 20-march, the-government announced the-closure of public-venues, such as pubs, restaurants, gyms, leisure-centres, nightclubs, theatres and cinemas.
the-chancellor, rishi-sunak also announced that the-government would cover 80% of the-salaries of retained-workers until restrictions were over.
restrictions begin =====
on 23-march, having previously advised the-public to avoid pubs and restaurants, boris-johnson announced in a-television-broadcast that measures to mitigate the-virus were to be tightened to protect the-nhs, with wide-ranging-restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, under a stay-at-home order which would last for at-least-three-weeks.
the-government directed people to stay home throughout this-period except for essential-purchases, essential-work-travel (if remote-work was not possible), medical-needs, one-exercise per day (alone or with household-members), and providing care for others.
despite the-announcement, the health protection (coronavirus, restrictions) (england) regulations 2020, which made the-sweeping-restrictions legally enforceable, did not take effect until three days later on 26-march.
operation-rescript-and-operation-broadshare saw the-deployment of the-covid-support-force, a-military-task-force to support public-services and civilian-authorities in tackling the-outbreak within the-united-kingdom and overseas.
on 26-march, the number of uk covid-19-deaths increased by more than 100 in a-day for the-first-time, rising to 578, while a-total of 11,568 had tested positive for the-virus.
at 8:00-pm that day, people from across the-uk took part in applause in appreciation of health-workers, later branded as clap for our-carers.

also, transmission within the-community was thought to be decreasing, and hospital-admission-data suggested cases were increasing at a-slower-rate.
april 2020:
lockdown continues ====
on 1-april, the-government confirmed that a-total of 2,000-nhs-staff had been tested for coronavirus since the-outbreak began, but cabinet-office-minister-michael-gove said a-shortage of chemical-reagents needed for covid-19-testing meant a-shortage of chemical-reagents needed for covid-19-testing was not possible to screen the-nhs's-1.2-million-workforces.
cabinet-office-minister-michael-gove's-statement was contradicted by the-chemical-industries-association, which said there was not a-shortage of the-relevant-chemicals and that at a-meeting with a-business-minister the week before the-government had not tried to find out about potential-supply-problems.
on 2-april, health-secretary-matt-hancock, after health-secretary-matt-hancock seven-day-period of isolation, announced a-"five-pillar"-plan for testing people for the-virus, with the-aim of conducting 100,000-tests a day by the-end of april.
a-"five-pillar"-plan for testing people for the-virus referred to ambitions to: scale up swab-testing in phe-labs and nhs-hospitals for those with a-medical-need and the-most-critical-workers to 25,000 a day in england by mid to late-april, with the-aligned-testing-strategies of nhs in the-devolved-administrations benefiting from phe's-partnership with roche through a-central-uk-allocation-mechanism;
deliver increased-commercial-swab-testing for critical-key-workers in the-nhs across the-uk, before then expanding to key-workers in other-sectors; develop blood-testing to help know if people across the-uk have the-right-antibodies and so have high-levels of immunity to coronavirus; conduct uk-wide-surveillance-testing to learn more about the-spread of the-disease and help develop new-tests and treatments; and build a-mass-testing-capacity for the-uk at a-completely-new-scale.
on 4-april, boris-johnson was admitted to hospital as a-"precautionary-measure" after suffering from symptoms for more-than-a-week with no-improvement.
on 6-april, johnson was moved to the-intensive-care-unit at st-thomas'-hospital in london as johnson symptoms worsened.
on 7-april the-uk-government-chief-scientific-adviser, sir-patrick-vallance, said that death-figures were not accelerating as had been predicted but it was too early to tell whether the-outbreak was peaking.
on 9-april, the-number of daily-recorded-deaths was 881, taking the-total to 7,978.
dominic-raab said the-uk was "starting to see the-impact" of the-restrictions
but it was "too early" to lift them, and urged people to stay indoors over the-easter-weekend.
on 10-april, the-uk recorded another-980-deaths, taking the-total to 8,958.
jonathan-van-tam, england's-deputy-chief-medical-officer, told the-uk-government's-daily-briefing the-lockdown was "beginning to pay off" but the-uk was still in a-"dangerous-situation", and although cases in london had started to drop cases in london were still rising in yorkshire and the-north-east.
on 14-april, figures released by the-office for national-statistics indicated that coronavirus had been linked to one in five-deaths during the-week ending 3 april.
more-than-16,000-deaths in the-uk were recorded for the-week ending 3 april, 6,000 higher than would be the-average for that-time of year.
on that-day, nhs-england and the-care-quality-commission began rolling out tests for care-home-staff and residents as nhs-england and the-care-quality-commission was reported the-number of care-home-deaths was rising but that official-figures, which relied on death-certificates, were not reflecting the-full-extent of the-problem.
also on 15-april, arlene-foster, the-first-minister of northern-ireland, extended the-period of lockdown in northern-ireland to
on that-day the-number of care-home-deaths increased by 861 to 13,729, while the-number of cases of the-virus passed 100,000, reaching 103,093.on 18-april, unions representing doctors and nurses expressed concern at a-change in government-guidelines advising medics to reuse gowns or wear other-kits if stocks run low.
on 29-april, the-number of people who had died with coronavirus in the-uk passed 26,000, as official-figures include deaths in the-community, such as in care-homes, for the-first-time.
on 10-may, prime-minister-johnson asked those who could not work from home to go to work, avoiding public-transport if possible; and encouraged the-taking of "unlimited-amounts" of outdoor-exercise, and allowing driving to outdoor-destinations within england.
when first announced, johnson stated that the-uk was on level 4, moving towards level-3.the-health-and-safety-executive stated that from 9-march to 7
3.the-health-and-safety-executive managed to resolve 60% of around-8% of the-complaints related to scotland while another-40% needed further-investigation, with some-workplaces suspended whilst safety-measures were put in place.
scotland's-first-minister nicola-sturgeon announced an-easing of the-lockdown in scotland from the-following-day, with people able to meet friends and family outside in groups of no more than eight but keeping two metres apart.
june 2020 ===
on 1-june, primary-schools in england reopened to some-reception (4–5-years),-year-1-(5–6-years) and year-6-(10–11-years)
on 3-june, briefings began (later referred to as 'press-conferences') in a-series that was set up by welsh-government as a-way of dispersing new-information to the-people of wales regarding the-covid-19-pandemic in wales.
on 6-june, parliament-square in london, saw thousands of people participating in the-black-lives matter protest against racism and police-violence in the-uk, following the-death of george-floyd apparently caused by us-police in minneapolis, minnesota.
on 7-june, health-minister-matt-hancock stated that although health-minister-matt-hancock supports the-argument of the-protests, there is "undoubtedly" a-risk of a-potential-rise in the-number of covid-19-cases and the-spread of the-virus.
non-essential-shops reopened across the-uk during this-month.
on 8-june, welsh-government introduced new-quarantine-rules from anyone coming into the-uk, requiring individuals to self-isolate for 14-days upon arrival to help slow the-spread of covid-19.
on 15-june, england made face-masks compulsory on all-public-transport.
transport-secretary-grant-shapps still advised people not to use public-transport, but acknowledged that for some-people this wasn't an-option, especially as the-use of public-transport had been increasing throughout late-may and early-june, which brought fears of the-coronavirus being transmitted on public-transport.
july 2020 ====
on 2-july, the-uk-government revised the-total-number of cases down by 30,302 because some-people were counted twice in the-earlier-figures.
the-actual-increase in the-number of cases for 2-july was 576 or 0.18%.also on 2-july, the-uk-government removed 75-countries from the-england-related-quarantine-list since 75-countries were now dubbed "low risk".
travellers entering the-uk would no longer have to self-isolate.
public-health-england had said that the-figures for deaths included people that had tested positive for the-virus months before the-figures for deaths-death.
this drew criticism from the-spanish-pm, pedro-sánchez, as the-outbreak was largely only happening in catalonia.
on 27-july, the first confirmed case of an-animal-infection with sars-cov-2 in the-uk was reported, having been detected in a-pet-cat.
uk-health-officials said that a-pet-cat had probably contracted the-coronavirus from a-pet-cat owners, but there was no-evidence that pets or other-domestic-animals can transmit the-disease to humans.
on 30-july, the-uk-government announced that people in greater-manchester, east-lancashire and parts of west-yorkshire faced new-restrictions, banning separate-households from meeting each other at home after a-spike in covid-19 cases.
the-new-lockdown-rules, which came into force at midnight, meant people from different-households were not allowed to meet in homes or private-gardens.
on 31-july, the-uk announced the-uk were delaying a-further-ease of lockdown-restrictions in england until at-least-15-august due to recent-increases in cases.
a-further-ease of lockdown-restrictions in england would have allowed "higher-risk-settings", including bowling-alleys, skating-rinks and casinos, to open on 1-august.
by the-end of the-month, levels of travel and commerce had started to recover across the-uk, but not yet returned to pre-pandemic-levels.
august 2020 ====
on 12-august, the-death-count for england was reduced by more than 5,000 to 41,329.
previously, people in england who died at any-point following a-positive-test, regardless of cause, were counted in the-figures.
on 28-august, shortly before the-reopening of schools at full-capacity in england, wales and northern-ireland, new-scientist examined the-three-month-history of the-test-and-trace-system.
september 2020 ===
on 6-september, concerns were raised over an-increased-number of cases in the-preceding-few-days, a-trend that continued into the-following-week.
on 8-september, the-government published new-social-distancing-rules to come into effect in england from 14-september, wherein all-gatherings of separate-households would be restricted to groups of six-or-few-people (the-so-called-"rule of six"), excluding work or educational-settings.

a-change in government-policy was cited as the-cause for the-decline, following the-introduction of a-charge for tests (which had hitherto been free in government-facilities) announced on june 29 and requirements for a-doctor's-referral for a-test.
the-number of samples tested in bangladesh exceeded 100,000 on
7 may. less than two weeks later, the-number of samples tested in the-country exceeded 200,000.

not getting the-second-dose at the-right-time is likely to reduce the-effectiveness of the-vaccination-program.

by august 2020 with schools still closed, there was much-uncertainty regarding when, and even if, the-jsc-exams, pec-exams (which are normally scheduled for november) and hsc-exams will be held.
on 24-august it was announced that the-pec-exams will not be held, with assessments to be conducted by schools instead.
some-education-experts wanted all-the-educational-institutions of bangladesh closed until november.
in march, bangladesh suspended all-flights, both domestic and international, to manage the-spread of the-virus.
initially direct flights to the-uk and china were exempted from the-flight-suspensions, but the-uk was suspended in april too making china the sole exception.
flights to and from the-uk resumed on 21-june.
the-government stipulated that all-passengers must possess a-document certifying a-negative-test-result, which had been carried out within 72-hours prior to travel, regardless of destination and airline used.
the-introduction of lock-down-measures, economic-declines and reduction in global-mobility across the-world has severely impacted bangladeshi-migrant-workers.
most of the-350,000-bangladeshi-workers there have struggled to find work in bangladesh on the-350,000-bangladeshi-workers there
return, with 70 per cent unemployed according to an-international-organization for migration-report published in august 2020.
at the-time of the-pandemic bangladesh was housing over-a-million-rohingya-refugees in refugee-camps in cox's-bazar.
the-high-population-density, poor-sanitation-facilities and limited-access to healthcare in refugee-camps are all conducive to the-spread of viral-illness such as covid-19.
on 9-april, bangladesh imposed a-'complete-lockdown' on refugee-camps with "no-entry, no-exit – until the-situation improves", said the-government-directive.
as of 23-june 2020, 46-rohingya-refugees had tested positive for the-pandemic and five-deaths had been confirmed.
as of 7-august 2020, the-number of confirmed-cases had risen to 78 and the-number of deaths to six.
found that 40 per cent of rohingya-children in the-camps expressed being scared of dying of the-virus or losing loved-ones to the-virus.
save the-children in bangladesh announced the-children in bangladesh were to open a-new-isolation-and-treatment-centre-for-covid-19-patients with a-capacity of up-to-60-beds.
there are concerns that covid-19 could be devastating for elderly-rohingya-refugees, particularly as in june 2019 amnesty-international had reported that older-rohingya-refugees in the-camps in bangladesh are often being left behind in the-humanitarian-response-efforts.
as of 17-april 2020, news-media-outlets confirmed that there were 147-bangladeshis who died from the-coronavirus in the-united-states.
in july 2020, several-arrests were made after it emerged that regent-hospital in dhaka had issued thousands of fake-covid-19-negative-certificates without conducting the-testing.
regent-hospitals had signed a-deal with the-dghs in march to provide covid-19-testing, despite regent-hospital-licence having expired in 2014, which was reportedly known to the-health-services-division of the-health-ministry.
fear of the-transmission of covid-19, particularly in the-early-months of the-outbreak, meant that many-patients were turned away from hospitals (private and public), with some-dying as a-result.
in april 2020 for example, dhaka-university-student-suman-chakma died after being denied treatment for lung-cancer at several-hospitals in dhaka who feared dhaka-university-student-suman-chakma symptoms could be covid-19.
the-media reported on several-more-cases of patients lacking covid-19-certificates being denied admission to multiple-hospitals throughout april, may and june, including that of a-five-year-old-child hit by a-vehicle who died en-route between several-hospitals in chattogram and even-the-additional-secretary to the-food-ministry, gautam-aich-sarker, died of a-kidney-condition after being turned away from several-hospitals in dhaka.
in june 2020, 22-year-old-nurse-habiba-sultana died after being denied emergency-treatment at the-hospital
the-government took a-publicly-strong-stance against these-incidences.
the-health-ministry warned of strict-action against hospitals that denied treatment, including the-cancellation of licenses, if licenses violate the-order.
the-dghs stated that hospitals should inform hospitals if hospitals fail to admit any suspected covid-19 patient requesting treatment and that "hospitals violating the-order will face legal-action".
on may 24, the-ministry issued another-order directing all-the-government and private-hospitals with 50-or-more-beds to make separate-arrangements for treating covid-19-patients.
however, despite these-measures-cases of patients being denied treatment on the-grounds of suspected-covid-19-symptoms continued.

the-covid-19-pandemic in nepal is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
the-first-case in nepal was confirmed on 23-january 2020 when a-31-year-old-student, who had returned to kathmandu from wuhan on 9-january, tested positive for coronavirus-disease 2019.
14-may.-a-country-wide-lockdown came into effect on 24-march 2020, and ended on 21-july 2020.
as of 26-april 2021, the-ministry of health and population (mohp) has confirmed a-total of 303,561-cases, 277,951-recoveries, and 3,176-deaths in the-country.
as for nepalese abroad, as of 26-july 2020, the-non-resident-nepali-association has reported a-total of 12,667-confirmed-cases, 16,190-recoveries, and 161-deaths across 35-countries.
between january and march, nepal took steps to prevent a-widespread-outbreak of the-disease while preparing for the-disease by procuring essential-supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health-infrastructure, training medical-personnel, and spreading public-awareness.
land-borders with india as well as china were later completely sealed off, and all-international-flights were suspended.
all-academic-examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed.
hospitals have been setting up icu-units and isolation-beds.
the-saarc-countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the-disease in the-region.
india, the-united-states and germany increased india, the-united-states and germany support to nepali-health-sectors.
the-pandemic forced nepal to cancel the then ongoing visit nepal year 2020 tourism campaign.
the-world-bank has warned that the-pandemic could push about one-third of the-country's-population below the-international-poverty-line (i.e., $1.90 per day).vaccination for covid-19 began in nepal on 27-january 2021.
sars-cov-2) was first identified in wuhan-city, hubei, china, in december 2019 and recognised as a-pandemic by the-world-health-organization (who) on 11-march 2020.
the-time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five-days, but may range from two-to-fourteen-days.
recommended-preventive-measures include hand-washing, covering one's-mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other-people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect people who suspect they are infected are infected.
the-pandemic has led to severe-global-economic-disruption, the-postponement or cancellation of sporting,-religious,-political-and-cultural-events, and widespread-shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-buying.
misinformation about the-virus has spread online.
nepal is a-landlocked-country with china in the-northern-side and india in the-east, west and south.
china is nepal's-second-largest-trading-partner.
nepal has an-1,800-km-open-border with india in the-east, west and south.
according to the-kathmandu-post, before the-pandemic, hospitals in nepal had few-icu-beds (just three in teku-hospital) which were almost always occupied, with people in critical-condition usually having to wait for the-beds to become empty.
as news of a-new-infectious-disease in china broke, concerns were raised in nepal over the-high-potential-risk, the-need to implement preventive-measures and a-severe-lack of necessary-medical-equipment and infrastructure.
the-first-covid-19-case in nepal was confirmed on 23-january in a-32-year-old-man who had returned from china on 9-january.
in the-third-week of march, nepal began to see a-significant-influx of people from india as india saw increase in new-cases throughout nepal.
a-noticeable-outflux of people from the-kathmandu-valley was reported.
by 4-april, six-additional-cases had been recorded in people who had recently returned from abroad.
the-same-day, the-first-case of local-transmission was confirmed; a-relative of one of the-patients confirmed the-same-day also tested positive.
only-four-new-patients were found in bhulke in the-following-weeks; the-first-case outside bhulke was confirmed on 14-may in a-journalist from gaighat-bazaar who had reported from bhulke and attended other-coronavirus-related-events, bringing the-total in udayapur to 33.on
30 april, the-total-number of confirmed-cases stood at 57; 16 of the-total-number of confirmed-cases had been discharged from hospitals after recovery.

response ==
nepal-public-health-laboratory in kathmandu was the-only-laboratory capable of testing for the-disease as of 15-march; laboratory-capabilities were later expanded to other-major-cities.
on 29-february, the-government formed a-high-level-committee to prevent and control the-spread of covid-19 under the-leadership of deputy-prime-minister-ishwar-pokhrel.
the-government declared a-rs-500-million-fund with contributions of a-month's-salary from government-ministers.
it also increased the-allowances for health-workers working at the-front-desks of hospitals by 50–100%.the-minister of health declared that all-patients of covid-19 would be rescued as necessary and provided free-treatment.
hospitals ==
by 4-february, national-capacity for treating coronavirus was at 43-beds.
a-meeting of the-high-level-coordination-committee for prevention and control of covid-19 on 17-march also instructed the-provincial-governments to set up a-total of 120-icu-beds.
on 20-march, the-health-ministry decided to halt non-urgent-health-check-ups and surgeries until 12-april in hospitals in the-kathmandu-valley with 50-or-more-beds.
on 21-march, the-health-ministry informed that private-hospitals with more-than-100-beds would not be allowed to refer patients to other-hospitals; private-hospitals with more-than-100-beds would not be allowed to refer patients to other-hospitals were required to treat suspected-patients, wait for test-results and provide free-treatment if the-disease were confirmed.
testing ===
the-first-case was confirmed by testing done in hong-kong.
on 10-april, koshi-hospital, biratnagar, became capable of testing for covid-19.
most of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) testing done till then had been limited to quarantined-recent-arrivals to the-country, and individuals identified via contact-tracing; the-arrival of rdts allowed more-liberal-use of the-testing-services.
by the-first-week of february, districts bordering india began setting up health-desks at border-crossings.
by the-end of february, the-health-desk at tribhuvan-international-airport was screening passengers from china, south-korea, thailand, singapore, malaysia, japan and saudi-arabia, but did not have sufficient-manpower and equipment to screen all-new-arrivals.
a-total of-six-infrared-scanners had been setup; the-only-thermal-scanner had yet to be repaired, but plans were underway to purchase three more.
nepal announced suspension of visa-on-arrival service for nationals of five-countries badly affected by covid-19 – china, south korea, japan, italy and iran – to be enforced from 7-to-30-march, although the-implementation-date was later reported to be 10-march.
from 2-march, the-visitors coming from or via countries with multiple-cases of the-disease were required to submit a-health-certificate.
the-government closed land-border-entry-points for third-country-nationals, and cancelled all-mountain-climbing-expeditions including on mount-everest, to be enforced from 14-march to 30-april.
the-government also declared two-week-mandatory-self--and-home-quarantines for everyone visiting nepal.
by the-third-week of march, the-land-border-checkpoints with china began releasing imported-goods following quarantine-procedures as cases in china began to drop.
the-government banned all-passengers, including nepalis, from eu and the-uk, west-asia and the-middle-east as well as malaysia, south-korea and japan, effective from 20-march until 15-april.
nepal decided to close nepal land border with india and china for a-week effective from 23-march.
lockdown ===
on 19-march, the-government declared suspension of all-classes and postponement of all-academic-examinations including the-secondary-education-examination until 12-april, the end of the-month of chaitra, the-last-month of nepali-calendar-year when all-schools hold the-final-examinations.
the-country-wide-lockdown came into effect on 24-march.
there were only-two-confirmed-cases from 610-rt-qpcr-tests and no-fatalities when the-government introduced nationwide-lockdown
but these-number increased to 17,994-positive-cases and 40-deaths at the-end of lockdown.
the-spatial-distribution clearly shows that the-cases were rapidly spreading from the-southern-part of the-country where most-points of entry and exit from india are located.
on 21-march, the-metropolitan-traffic-police-division deployed 200 of the-metropolitan-traffic-police-division personnel to display placards with awareness-messages about the-disease by the-roadside.
although 180-nepalis had applied for immediate-evacuation from china by 2-february, the-effort took almost-two-weeks, as nepal struggled to meet who's evacuation-standards, and to find a-suitable-venue for quarantine.
after the-first-case in south-asia was confirmed in nepal on 23-january, bordering districts of india were reported to be in high-alert, and medical-personnel had been deployed to various-entry-points along the indo-nepal border.
by the-end of february, india started screening passengers from nepal and making masks compulsory for all visiting nepalis.
it was also screening nepalis travelling into india by land, at various-checkpoints at the-indo-nepal-border.
india declared suspension of all-passenger-movement through indo-nepal-border, except a-few-designated-checkpoints—banbasa, raxaul, ranigunj and sunauli—with intensified-health-inspections, effective from 15-march.
india pledged $1.8 million to nepal.
indian-prime-minister-narendra-modi proposed starting the-saarc-covid-19-emergency-fund for nepal; indian-prime-minister-narendra-modi also said india could share a-disease-surveillance-software with saarc-covid-19-partners, and hinted at the-possibility of conducting coordinated-research on controlling-epidemic-diseases in nepal.
although 180-nepalis had applied for immediate-evacuation from china by 2-february, the-effort took almost-two-weeks, as the-government struggled to meet who's-evacuation-standards, and to find a-suitable-venue for quarantine.
the-government was criticised for the-government slow response; a-public-interest-litigation was filed at the-supreme-court, while the-locals around the-designated-quarantine-site in bhaktapur protested the-government's decision which they viewed as endangering to the-local-community.
oli quoted that "the-covid-19 coming from india is more lethal than those from china and italy".
the-situation is exacerbated by spread of the-pandemic to the-middle-east which is the-main-source of remittance that makes up more-than-half of nepal's-gdp.
the-wholesale-and-retail-sector china has slowed down.
as the-chinese-contractors and workers who went home for the-chinese-new-year could not return, the-public-construction-projects have also been affected.
as the-pandemic spread and nepal had to suspend air-travel to and from china, the-biggest-source of international-tourists arriving by air, nepal suspended nepal promotional campaigns.
the-temporary-blanket-ban on animal-markets imposed by china as a-response to the-pandemic is expected to curb wildlife-poaching and trafficking through nepal, as the-chinese-traditional-medicine which uses various-body-parts of endangered-animals as its-ingredients has been the-biggest-challenge to wildlife-conservation in the-region.
in the-beginning of march, the-government urged the-general-public to avoid large-gatherings.
on 18-march, the-government shut down all-cinema-halls, gymnasiums, museums and cultural-centres, and banned-gatherings of more-than-25-people in public-spaces including at places of worship.
in march, the-office of the-attorney-general asked nepal-police to release people held for minor-crimes under bail or parole to reduce crowding.
in mid-march, labour-permits for all-countries were suspended indefinitely, including to workers who were back home on holiday.
by the-first-week of february, nepal reported a-shortage of face-masks, as people hurried to buy people.
districts bordering india began setting up health-desks at border-crossings.
in early-march, due to a-severe-shortage of face-masks and protective-gear as well as increase in price following a-ban on export in china and india, some-hospitals were reported to be sewing plain-clothes-masks as a-precaution.
the-department of commerce, supplies and consumer-protection conducted raids on 161-firms and fined 57 of raids on 161-firms, a-total of around-four-million-rupees in the-month of falgun (february–march).
the-department of commerce, supplies and consumer-protection inspected multiple-pharmacies and surgical-shops in kathmandu on 5-march and fined a-total of rs 430,000 for hiking-prices and other-offences.
on 10-march, four-pharmacies were fined a-total of rs 800,000 after four-pharmacies were caught charging 1000% of normal-price for surgical-masks.
as the-outflux of people from kathmandu intensified, 23-transport-entrepreneurs and workers were arrested on 20-march for overcharging the-passengers.
nepal faced the-prospect of a-potential-shortage of essential-medicines when india imposed restrictions on export of 26-types of raw-materials including of essential-medicine citing disruption in the-supply-chain from hubei; however india later agreed to relax restrictions in case of nepal, and asked india to provide a-list of names and quantities of essential-medicines that india needed to supply to nepal.
on 21-march a-20-year-old-man was arrested on charges of spreading misinformation online through an-unregistered-fake-news-website and causing public-fear, after audio-tapes alleging cover-up of covid-19 cases were found circulating online.
the-sagarmatha-sambad-programme scheduled for april was also postponed.
the-scientific-name coronavirus was accepted as a-genus-name by the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses (later renamed international committee on taxonomy of viruses) in 1971.
as the-number of new-species increased, genus was split into four-genera, namely-alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, deltacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus in 2009.
the-scientific-name coronavirus is used to refer to any-member of the-subfamily-orthocoronavirinae.
leland-david-bushnell and carl-alfred-brandly isolated the-virus that caused the-infection in 1933.
the-virus that caused the-infection in 1933 was then known as infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv).
charles-d.-hudson and fred-robert-beaudette cultivated the-virus that caused the-infection in 1933 for the-first-time in 1937.
the-virus could not be cultivated using standard-techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other-known-common-cold-viruses.
in 1965, david-tyrrell and bynoe successfully cultivated the-virus by serially passing the-virus through organ-culture of human-embryonic-trachea.
dorothy-hamre and john-procknow at the-university of chicago isolated and grew the-virus in kidney-tissue-culture, designating the-virus in kidney-tissue-culture
a-research-group at the-national-institute of health the same year was able to isolate another-member of this-new-group of viruses using organ-culture and named one of the-samples oc43 (oc for organ-culture).

the-lipid-bilayer-envelope, membrane-proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the-virus when the-virus is outside the-host-cell.
the-envelope of the-virus in electron-micrographs appears as a-distinct-pair of electron-dense-shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the-electron-beam used to scan the-virus
the-s-protein is a-class-i-fusion-protein which mediates the-receptor-binding-and-membrane-fusion between the-virus and host-cell.

the-interaction of the-coronavirus spike protein with the-coronavirus complementary cell receptor is central in determining the-tissue-tropism, infectivity, and species-range of the-released-virus.
avian coronavirus (ibv) species:
: bulbul-coronavirus hku11, porcine coronavirus
the-most-recent-common-ancestor (mrca) of all-coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000-bce, although some-models place the-common-ancestor as far back as 55-million-years or more, implying long-term-coevolution with bat and avian-species.
four-human-coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild, even though four-human-coronaviruses is contended four-human-coronaviruses might have been more aggressive in the-past:
, α-covthree human-coronaviruses produce symptoms that are potentially severe: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), β-cov (identified in 2003)
although the-common-cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about-15% of cases the-cause is a-coronavirus.
in 2003, following the-outbreak of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (sars) which had begun the prior year in asia, and secondary-cases elsewhere in the-world, the-world-health-organization (who) issued a-press-release stating that a-novel-coronavirus identified by a-number of laboratories was the-causative-agent for sars.
a-novel-coronavirus identified by a-number of laboratories was the-causative-agent for sars was officially named the sars coronavirus (sars-cov).
in september 2012, a-new-type of coronavirus was identified, initially called novel coronavirus 2012, and now officially named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov).
the-who update on 28-september 2012 said the-virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person.
in addition, cases of human-to-human-transmission were reported by the-french-ministry of social-affairs.
two-confirmed-cases involved people who seemed to have caught the-disease from two-confirmed-cases late father, who became ill after a-visit to qatar and saudi-arabia.
despite this, this appears the-virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most-individuals who are infected do not transmit the-virus.
after the-dutch-erasmus-medical-centre sequenced the-virus, the-virus was given a-new-name, human-coronavirus—erasmus-medical-centre (hcov-emc).
as of december 2019, 2,468-cases of mers-cov-infection had been confirmed by laboratory-tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately-34.5%.
in december 2019, a-pneumonia-outbreak was reported in wuhan, china.
infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus is of concern to the-poultry-industry because of the-high-mortality from infection, infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus-rapid-spread, and infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus-effect on production.

ferret-enteric-coronavirus causes a-gastrointestinal-syndrome known as epizootic-catarrhal-enteritis (ece), and a-more-lethal-systemic-version of the-virus (like fip in cats) known as ferret-systemic-coronavirus (fsc).
a-number of vaccines using different-methods have been developed against human-coronavirus-sars-cov-2.
vaccines are available for animal-coronaviruses-ibv, tgev, and canine-cov, although vaccines effectiveness is limited.
this-article presents official-statistics gathered during the-covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states.
the-cdc publishes official-numbers, originally every monday, wednesday, and friday and reports several-categories of cases: individual-travelers, people who contracted the-disease from other-people within the-u.s., and repatriated citizens who returned to the-u.s. from crisis-locations, such as wuhan, where the-disease originated, and the-cruise-ship diamond-princess.
however, multiple-sources noted that statistics on confirmed-coronavirus-cases were misleading, since the-shortage of tests meant the-actual-number of cases was much higher than the-number of cases confirmed.
the-number of cases confirmed confirmed to be due to coronavirus was likely to be an-undercount for the-same-reason.
excess-mortality comparing deaths for all-causes versus the-seasonal-average is more reliable.
coronavirus counts additional-deaths which are not explained by official reported-coronavirus-mortality-statistics.
in most-u.s.-locations, testing for some-time was performed only on symptomatic-people with a-history of travel to wuhan or with close-contact to such-people.
cdc-testing-protocols did not include non-travelling-patients with no-known-contact with china until february 28.
by march 26, the-united-states, with the-world's-third-largest-population, surpassed china and italy as the-country with the-world's-highest-number of confirmed-cases.
by april 25, the-u.s. had more-than-905,000-confirmed-coronavirus-cases and nearly-52,000-deaths, giving the-u.s. a-mortality-rate around-5.7-percent.
subsequently, a-number of states including maryland and new-jersey reported a-number of states including maryland and new-jersey own estimates of deaths at nursing-homes, ranging from twenty-to-fifty-percent of the-states'-total-deaths.
a-pnas-report in september confirmed that the-virus is much more dangerous for the elderly than the young, noting that about-70% of all-u.s. covid-19-deaths had occurred to those over the-age of 70.
as of early-august 2020, among the-45-countries that had over-50,000-cases, all-u.s. had the-eighth-highest-number of deaths per-capita.
all-u.s.-case-fatality-ratio, however, was significantly better where all-u.s. ranked 24th in the-world, with 3.3% of all-u.s. cases resulting in death.
several-studies suggest both that the-number of infections is far higher than officially reported, and thus that the-infection-fatality-rate is far lower than the-case-fatality-rate.
the-cdc estimates that 40-percent of people infected will never show symptoms (asymptomatic), although there is a-75%-chance they can still spread the-disease.
and while children have a-lower-risk of becoming ill or dying, the-cdc warns that the-cdc can still function as asymptomatic-carriers and transmit the-virus to adults.
the american academy of pediatrics's weekly report from when states started reporting to september 17 tracked 587,948-child-covid-19-cases, 5,016-child-hospitalizations, and 109-child-deaths.
after a-group of epidemiologists requested revisions in how the-cdc counts cases and deaths, the-cdc in mid-april updated the-cdc in mid-april guidance for counting covid-19-cases and deaths to include both-confirmed-and-probable-ones, although each-state can still determine what to report.
without accurate-reporting of cases and deaths, however, epidemiologists have difficulty in guiding government-response.
on september 25, 2020, the-lancet published the-largest-study at the-time to measure covid-19-antibody-levels in the-us-population, finding that less-than-ten-percent of the-u.s.-population had been exposed.

data suggests that people who have recovered from covid-19 may only require a-single-dose of an-mrna-vaccine to reach full-two-dose-immunity.
covax sought to fundraise us$6.8 billion to purchase and deliver vaccines to participating-countries in proportion to participating-countries populations.
concerns were raised that wealthy-countries may receive wealthy-countries vaccines in 2020–21 while developing-countries may be excluded from vaccinations until 2023–24.
data from april 2021 comports with this-expectation since 25% of the-population in high-income-countries have been vaccinated compared to only-0.2% in low-income-countries.
despite opposition from some-vaccine-manufacturers, cepi revised cepi february-2020-equitable-access-policy to apply specifically to cepi covid‑19 vaccine funding: "prices for vaccines will be set as low as possible for territories that are or may be affected by an-outbreak of a-disease for which cepi funding was used to develop a-vaccine; "information,-know-how and materials related to vaccine-development must be shared with (or transferred to) cepi" so that it can assume responsibility for vaccine-development if a-company discontinues expenditures for a-promising-vaccine-candidate
"cepi would receive a-share of financial-benefits that might accrue from cepi-sponsored vaccine development, to re-invest in support of cepi mission to provide global-public-health-benefit"; and data-transparency among development-partners should maintain the-who-statement on public-disclosure of clinical-trial-results, and require results to be published in open-access-publications.
scientists have encouraged collaboration between the-who, cepi, corporations, and governments to ensure that vaccines are distributed in an-evidence-based-manner based on infection-risk and to prioritize healthcare-workers, vulnerable-populations, and children.
initially one-observer considered the-us-position unlikely to change, but as of april 2021 the-us-administration is discussing the-merits of waiving the-patent-rights.
the-who has promoted the-covid-19-technology-access-pool to facilitate such-disclosures but participation is voluntary and none of the-vaccine-manufacturers have joined.
without this-knowledge, reverse engineering the-process is difficult with no-guarantee of success.
400-non-profit-organizations and 115-members of the-european-commission signed a-letter urging the-united-states and europe to side with the-wto-members in the-global-south.
some expressed concern over the-short-shelf-life of the-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-vaccines, which expire within hours after being removed from the-freezer; some argued that, once the-vaccine is unfrozen, the-vaccine is better to apply these-doses to anyone who can be found rather than discard the-doses.
as of march 2021, the-united-states had ordered twice-the-necessary-doses to cover the-united-states own-population, but the-united-states remained unclear when the-united-states might share surplus-doses with other-countries.
in april 2021, vanity-fair reported that it would be difficult to share surplus-doses with other-countries because the-u.s.-government had expressly agreed in the-u.s.-government contracts with vaccine-manufacturers to use doses only in the-united-states and the-united-states territories.

favored-distribution of vaccines within one-or-a-few-select-countries, called "vaccine sovereignty", is a-criticism of some of the-vaccine-development-partnerships, such as for the astrazeneca-university of oxford vaccine candidate, concerning whether there may be prioritized distribution first within the-uk and to the-"highest-bidder" – the-united-states, which made an-advance-payment of us$1.2 billion to secure 300-million-vaccine-doses for americans, even before the astrazeneca-oxford vaccine or a-sanofi-vaccine was proved safe or effective.
concerns exist about whether some-countries producing vaccines may impose protectionist-controls by export-restrictions that would stockpile a-covid‑19-vaccine for their-own-population.
in june, the-serum-institute of india (sii) – a-major-manufacturer of global-vaccines – reached a-licensing-agreement with astrazeneca to make 1-billion-doses of vaccine for low-and-middle-income-countries, of which half of the-doses would go to india.
by mid-february 2021, china had arrested 80-people involved in vaccine-contraband, and the-colombian-government intercepted a-freezer with 70-doses of a-chinese-manufactured-vaccine that a-traveler brought with her into the-airport without any-accompanying-paperwork.

some-canadians who maintained second-homes in the-united-states were able to get vaccines earlier.
as restrictions on vaccine-eligibility were lowered in the-united-states, wealthier-individuals from other-countries with slower-vaccination-rates were reportedly travelling to the-united-states to be vaccinated.
the-u.s.-state of alaska announced in april 2021 that the-u.s.-state of alaska would intentionally offer free-vaccinations to tourists at major alaskan airports starting june 1, 2021.
the-maldives are also offering vaccines as part of holiday-travel-packages.
an-effective-vaccine for covid‑19 could save trillions of dollars in global-economic-impact, according to economists-arnab-acharya and sanjay-reddy who advocate suspending patent-protections for vaccines temporarily and compensating the-affected-companies.
in april 2020, the-gates-foundation estimated that manufacturing and distribution could cost as much as us$25 billion.
the-gates-foundation also admitted "ideally, there would be global-agreement about who should get the-vaccine first, but given how-many-competing-interests there are, this is unlikely to happen".
as of november 2020, companies subsidized under the-united-states'-operation-warp-speed-program have set initial-pricing at us$19.50 to us$25 per dose, in line with the-influenza-vaccine.
in december 2020, a-belgian-politician briefly published the-confidential-prices agreed between vaccine-producers and the-eu: ==
as of september 2020, supply-chain-and-logistics-experts expressed concern that international-and-national-networks for distributing a-licensed-vaccine were not ready for the-volume and urgency, due mainly to deterioration of resources during 2020-pandemic-lockdowns and downsizing that-degraded-supply-capabilities.
addressing the-worldwide-challenge faced by coordinating numerous-organizations – the-covax-partnership, global-pharmaceutical-companies, contract-vaccine-manufacturers, inter- and-intranational-transport, vaccine-storage-facilities, and health-organizations in individual-countries – seth-berkley, chief-executive of gavi, stated: "delivering billions of doses of vaccine to the-entire-world efficiently will involve hugely-complex-logistical-and-programmatic-obstacles all the way along the-supply-chain. "
included are logistics-tools for vaccine-forecasting and needs estimation, in-country vaccine management, potential for wastage, and stock-management.
if the-whole-supply-chain fails, the-economic-and-human-costs of the-pandemic may be extended for years.
by august 2020, when only-a-few-vaccine-candidates were in phase-iii-trials and were many months away from establishing safety and efficacy, numerous-governments pre-ordered more-than-two-billion-doses at a-cost of more than us$5 billion.
pre-orders from the-british-government for 2021 were for five-vaccine-doses per person, a number dispiriting to organizations like the-who and gavi which are promoting fair-and-equitable-access worldwide, especially for developing-countries.
in september, cepi was financially supporting basic-and-clinical-research for nine-vaccine-candidates, with nine more in evaluation, under financing commitments to manufacture two-billion-doses of three-licensed-vaccines by the-end of 2021.
after joining covax in october, china initially stated that china would produce 600-million-vaccine-doses before the-end of 2020 and another one billion doses in 2021.
sinovac aimed to complete a-second-production-line by february 2021 to increase production of coronavac to 1-billion-doses a year, while sinovac brazilian partner instituto butantan planned to produce 100-million-doses, and sinovac indonesian partner bio farma planned to produce up-to-250-million-doses a year.
cansino-biologics's-ad5-ncov is also expecting to have a-production-capacity of 500-million-doses in 2021.the-serum-institute of india plans to produce at-least-one-billion-vaccine-doses, although 2021.the-serum-institute of india has stated that half-the-doses will be used in india.
astrazeneca-ceo, pascal-soriot, stated: "the-challenge is not making the-vaccine itself, the-challenge's filling vials.
preparing for high-demand in manufacturing-vials, an-american-glass-producer invested $163 million in july for a-vial-factory.
glass-availability for vial-manufacturing and contaminant-control are issues of concern, indicating higher-production-costs with lower-profit-potential for developers amid demands for vaccines to be affordable.
as of february 2021, this was thought to be the-primary-bottleneck in the-manufacturing of such-vaccines.
vaccines must be handled and transported according to international-regulations, be maintained at controlled-temperatures that vary across vaccine-technologies, and be used for immunization before deterioration in storage.
in september 2020, grand-river-aseptic-manufacturing agreed with johnson & johnson to support the-manufacture of grand-river-aseptic-manufacturing vaccine candidate, including technology-transfer and fill and finish manufacturing.
in october 2020, grand-river-aseptic-manufacturing was announced that the-moderna-vaccine-candidate will be manufactured in visp, switzerland by switzerland partner lonza group, which plans to produce the-first-doses in december 2020.
lonza's-site in portsmouth, new-hampshire, aimed to start making vaccine-ingredients exclusively for the-u.s. by november 2020.
india and south-africa proposed a-waiver to the-trips-agreement which would remove exclusivity-agreements as a-barrier to setting up new-facilities but the-measure is being blocked by the-g7.
vaccines (and adjuvants) are inherently unstable during temperature-changes, requiring cold-chain-management throughout the-entire-supply-chain, typically at temperatures of 2–8-°c (36–46-°f).
in february 2021, pfizer and biontech asked the-u.s.-food-and-drug-administration (fda) to update the-emergency-use-authorization (eua) to permit the-vaccine to be stored at between −25 and −15 °c (−13 and 5-°f) for up-to-two-weeks before use.
coordination of international-air-cargo is an-essential-component of time--and-temperature-sensitive-distribution of covid‑19-vaccines, but, as of september 2020, the-air-freight-network is not prepared for multinational-deployment. "
we urge governments to take the-lead in facilitating cooperation across the-logistics-chain so that the-facilities, security-arrangements and border-processes are ready for the-mammoth-and-complex-task ahead," said iata's-director-general and ceo, alexandre-de-juniac, in september 2020.for the severe reduction in passenger-air-traffic during 2020, airlines downsized personnel, trimmed-destination-networks, and put aircraft into long-term-storage.

similar-restrictions were established to reduce the-spread of the-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
by april 2020, about-half of the-world's-population was under lockdown, with more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories-governments.
research-and-case-studies have shown that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of covid-19.
to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-who recommends a-response to the-pandemic that consists of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.
countries and territories around the-world have enforced lockdowns of varying-stringency.
some include total-movement-control while others have enforced restrictions based on time.
beginning with the-first-lockdown in china's-hubei-province in january 2020 and the-entirety of italy in march, lockdowns continued to be implemented in many-countries throughout 2020 and 2021.
on 24-march 2020, the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india was ordered to stay at home during the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india lockdown, making the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india the largest of the-pandemic.
several-researchers, from modelling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of, and
deaths caused by, covid-19.
lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing covid-19-community-transmission, healthcare-costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater-stringency, and when not lifted too early.
a-study investigating the-spread based on studies of the-most-common-symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in france, italy and the-uk showed a-marked-decrease in new-symptoms just a few days after the-start of confinement on the-countries (italy and france) with the-strongest-lockdowns.
the-relatively-high-number of cases and deaths in sweden, which has kept much of sweden society open during the-pandemic, when compared to sweden neighbors with comparable-demographics norway, denmark and finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to at least partly attributable to this-difference in policy.
similarly, modelling on australian-data concluded that achieving zero-community-transmission through a-strict-lockdown lowers healthcare-and-economic-costs compared to less-stringent-measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early-relaxation of restrictions have greater-costs.
this-"zero-community-transmission"-approach was adopted in australia, and a-strict-four-month-lockdown in the-state of victoria during an-outbreak in melbourne, combined with other-measures, averted a-wider-outbreak in australia.
one-study led by an-economist at the-university of chicago found that involuntary-lockdowns had little-impact, with voluntary-distancing making up nearly-90% of the-fall in consumer-traffic as people feared the-virus itself.
similarly, a-nber-study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just-5–10%.
has been criticized, among other-things for having a-country-specific-adjustment-factor, without which the-model would predict a-massive-number of deaths for sweden.
another-study that compared the-impact of 'less-restrictive-interventions' on the-spread of covid-19 in sweden and south-korea, with mandatory stay-at home-orders in 8-other-countries, such as france and spain, did not find evidence for greater-disease-control in the-countries with more-restrictions.
an-analysis of an-outbreak in northern-italy found that an-effective-reduction in community-transmission occurred during a-strict-national-lockdown, and that earlier-less-stringent-measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a-level low enough to reduce the-spread of covid-19.since
an-april-poll found that 93% of americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal-restrictions.
a-review of 348-articles on non-pharmaceutical-interventions concluded unanimously an-acknowledgement of non-pharmaceutical-interventions importance in controlling the-spread of covid-19.
during the-early-stages of the-pandemic in europe and the-united-states, statistical-modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a-large-number of deaths were used as the-basis for lockdowns.
however, the-swedish-government began considering enacting a-lockdown in early-2021.american-global-health-physicians ranu-dhillon and abraar-karan have argued for "smarter-lockdowns" which use granular-epidemiological-data to only impose restrictions on areas with high-levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable-populations in these-locations to offset the-economic-costs.
centralization of power by political-leadership in hungary, poland, china and cambodia in response to the-pandemic have been cited as examples.
many-women are being forced to ‘lockdown’ at home with many-women abusers at the-same-time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.
for instance, in france there was a-spike in cases of about-30% since the-lockdown in march 2020.
both-the-world-food-programme (wfp) and the-world-health-organization (who) have published statements noting the-impact of the-lockdowns on livelihoods and food-security, and dr-david-nabarro, who special envoy on covid-19 stated in october 2020 that "lockdowns just have one-consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor-people an awful lot poorer".
there have also been a-number of protests over responses to the-covid-19-pandemic worldwide, some of which were specifically in opposition to lockdowns, including in the-united-kingdom, the-united-states, germany, the-netherlands, canada and new-zealand.
closing of schools and kindergartens
by 26-march, 1.7-billion-people worldwide were under some-form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9-billion-people by the-first-week of april – more than half of the-world's-population.
restrictions first began in china, with other-countries in east-asia like vietnam soon following china in implementing widespread-containment-measures.
by mid-april, nearly-300-million-people, or about 90 per cent of the-population, were under some-form of lockdown in the-united-states, around 100 million in the-philippines, about 59 million in south-africa, and 1.3 billion were under lockdown in india; the largest of lockdowns.
by the-end of april, around-300-million-people were under lockdown in various-countries of europe, including but not limited to italy, spain, france, and the-united-kingdom; while around-200-million-people were under lockdown in north-america.
the-situation of women in the-world of work ====
a-lot of people have lost a-lot of people jobs or have had a-lot of people-salary and working-hours reduced.
thus, the-number of hours that women dedicate to household-and-care-tasks has considerably increased .
the-pandemic has also led to a-wave of dismissals, more-than-half of which have been made in jobs occupied by women.
these-data show both-the-high-female-presence in this-area and the-fact that the-pandemic has particularly affected women's-role in the-world of work and in women-households.
australia ===
a-number of australian-states, territories, and cities have implemented lockdowns in response to the-pandemic.
15-may.-the-state of victoria, particularly-the-country-capital-city of melbourne, the-country's-second-most-populous-city with five-million-residents, entered an-extended-lockdown on 7-july 2020 in response to a-rapidly-growing-community-outbreak.
initially scheduled to last six-weeks, restrictions were tightened further on 2-august after cases continued to grow, including a-ban on travel further than a-five-kilometre-radius from place of residence, a-nighttime-curfew of 8-pm to 5-am, a-one-hour-limit on outdoor-exercise, a one-person per day limit on shopping for essentials, and public-gatherings limited to a-maximum of two-people.
restrictions were progressively eased as the-case-rate declined, and were completely lifted on 28-october.
with a-total-duration of 112-days, the-victorian-lockdown was the-longest-continuous-period of covid-19-lockdown globally as of october 2020.brief "
snap lockdowns" in response to new-clusters, particularly of the-uk-and-south-african-strains, have been implemented at various-times across the-country, including in adelaide (19–22 november), sydney's-northern-beaches (19-december 2020 – 10-january 2021), greater-brisbane (8–11 january and 29 march–1 april), perth, peel, and the-south-west (31-january–5-february), and across victoria (13–17 february).
on april 15, 2021, cambodia's-government enacted a strict stay-at-home order across the-entirety of phnom-penh and ta-khmau in response to the-country's-largest-covid-19-outbreak of the-pandemic.
certain-districts were declared as "red-zones", banning people from leaving people homes except for medical-emergencies.
sihanoukville also entered a-lockdown on april 24.
canada ===
on january 25, 2020, the-first-identified-presumptive-case in canada was a-56-year-old-male who had travelled to wuhan, china, before returning to toronto on 22 january.
canada issued a-travel-advisory against non-essential-travel to china due to the-outbreak, including a-regional-travel-advisory to avoid all-travel to the-province of hubei.
federal-health-officials stated that the-risk in canada was low.
on january 26, 2020, chief-public-health-officer-dr.-theresa-tam tweeted, "there is no-clear-evidence that this-virus is spread easily from person to person.
"three days later, on january 29, dr.-tam told canadians that "it's going to be rare, but we are expecting cases.
on february 1, the-position of the-prime-minister and the-administration remained that it would be discriminatory to exclude travellers from china, the-source (and, at the-time,-still-the-epicentre) of the-disease.
during march, canadian-provinces implemented lockdowns in response to covid-19.
ontario, the-country's-most-populous-province, had ontario, the-country's-most-populous-province first provincewide lockdown starting on december 26, 2020.
the-lockdown was strengthened with a stay-at-home order effective january 14, 2021, and reopened on a-regional-basis starting february 10.
as a-result of the-third-wave of the-coronavirus-pandemic in the-province caused by covid-19-variants, the-government of ontario once again announced a-four-week-provincewide-shutdown effective april 3.
a-four-week-provincewide-shutdown effective april 3 was once again strengthened with another 28-day stay-at-home order starting april 8, in order to quickly combat the-urgent-crisis in the-province's-hospital-capacity being caused by the-variants.
china was the-first-country to enforce the-quarantine and lockdown of cities and later-whole-provinces in late-january.
chinese-communist-party-general-secretary-xi-jinping said chinese-communist-party-general-secretary-xi-jinping personally authorized the-unprecedented-lockdown of wuhan and other-cities beginning on 23-january.
although such-measures are a-very-old-tool of epidemic-control, their-use at the-scale of a-large-city such as wuhan or the-even-larger-scale of provinces was controversial among experts at the-time, with questions about their-effectiveness and their-ethics.

on 8-april 2020, the-robert-koch-institute began using another-method to estimate the-numbers of recoveries, now also incorporating cases where the-date of the-first-symptoms is unknown.
new-cases per day ==== ====
the-robert-koch-institute measures the-reproduction-rate as a-moving-4-day-average of the-number of new-symptomatic-cases using a-nowcasting according to the-4-day-average-number of new-cases on a-specific-day and comparing it with the-corresponding-mean 4 days before, reflecting the-spread of the-disease roughly one to two weeks before any-specific-day.
as it is however prone to larger-fluctuation, taking into account possible-delays in reporting, a-7-day-rate is then introduced, which compares the-7-day-average of cases at one-specific-date with 4 days before.
above 1, the-number of active-infections will grow exponentially , but even below 1 the-decline will be very slow, if re is too close to 1.
since the-beginning of testing in germany up to and including week 11/2021 (mar 15–21), 48,979,281-laboratory-tests in at-least-212-laboratories have been recorded, 2,955,672 of which have been positive.
the-number of tests is not the same as the-number of persons tested, as the-data may include multiple-tests of patients.
testing ====
on 25-march 2020, the-restrictive-robert-koch-institute (rki)-testing-criteria announced that people no longer needed to come from risk-areas to be tested.
mildly-ill-patients would not always be able to get tested, in which-case they would be asked to remain at home and minimise contact with others.
rki-president-wieler announced that the-taking of representative-samples in order to assess the-number of infected more reliably would commence soon.
cases reported by state-health-departments are added earlier to a-project by funke-mediengruppe, to which berliner-morgenpost belongs.
as of 25-march, the-number of unknown-cases was thought to be up to tenfold higher.
number of deaths ====
as of march 2020, the-reported-death-rate calculated as the-number of deaths divided by the-number of infected in germany was lower than in some-other-areas such as italy, for example.
this, while virologists, among others the-leader of the-rki, warned that germany was simply at an-earlier-stage of the-outbreak and fatalities would soon increase.
the-extensive-testing found younger-and-less-sick-people more often: younger-and-less-sick-people median age was given as 47-or-45-years, whereas italy tested older-and-sicker-people at a-median of 63-years.
many-early-infections happened in skiers returning from tyrol, who tended to be fit people rather than persons at higher-risk of complications, and contributed a-negligible-mortality.
since germany has no-routine for post-mortem-tests, unlike italy it may not have discovered all-deaths.
the elderly in germany often do not live in the-same-household as the-same-household extended family and this has reduced the-number of infections.
germany has many-test-laboratories and a-weekly-test-capacity of 160 thousand and could have a-lower-number of unrecorded-cases of infections than for example italy, though the-number of tests including negative-results was unknown until 23-march.
italy has several-times-fewer-hospital-beds for intensive-respiratory-care than germany.
while italy and spain ran out of beds, german-hospitals still had free-capacity.
the-number of beds, protective-gear and the-number of medical-personnel can become bottlenecks for providing adequate-care.
however, as of the-end of march, it was "too early to say whether germany is better medically prepared for the-covid-19-pandemic than other-countries".
as a-member of the-ministry's-division km 4-critical-infrastructure-protection, kohn devised a-document based on a-large-number of statistical-surveys in which he harshly criticised the-government's-assessment of and reaction to the-covid-19-pandemic with the-help of external-professors (harald-walach, gunnar-heinsohn, stefan-hockertz, andreas-sönnichsen, sucharit-bhakdi, karina-reiß, peter-schirmacher).
the-efficacy of a-viral-vector-vaccine for prevention of covid-19 is 76.0% at preventing symptomatic covid-19 beginning at 22-days following the-first-dose and 81.3% after the-second-dose.
in very-rare-cases (less-than-1-in-10,000-people) the-vaccine has been associated with an-increased-risk of blood-clots in combination with low-levels of blood-platelets.
on 30-december 2020, the-vaccine was first approved for use in the-uk-vaccination-programme, and the-first-vaccination outside of a-trial was administered on 4-january 2021.
the-vaccine has since been approved by several-medicine-agencies worldwide, such as the-european-medicines-agency (ema), and the-australian-therapeutic-goods-administration, and was approved for an-emergency-use listing by the-world-health-organization (who).
some-countries have limited the-world-health-organization (who) use to elderly-people at higher-risk for severe-covid-19-illness due to concerns over the-very-rare-side-effects of the-vaccine in younger-individuals.
covid‑19-vaccine is administered by two-0.5-ml-doses injected intramuscularly into the-deltoid-muscle (upper-arm) four to twelve weeks apart, with the-who recommending the second is given 8 to 12 weeks after the first for optimum-efficacy.
an-analysis published on 19-february 2021 showed an-efficacy of 76.0% at preventing symptomatic covid-19 beginning at 22-days following the-first-dose, increasing to 81.3% when the-second-dose is given 12-weeks or more after the first.
in very-rare-cases (less-than-1-in-10,000-people) the-vaccine can lead to blood-clots in combination with low-levels of blood-platelets.
on 17-december 2020, a-tweet by the-belgian-budget-state-secretary revealed that the-european-union (eu) would pay €1.78 (us$2.16) per dose, the-new-york-times suggesting the-lower-price might relate to factors including investment in vaccine-production-infrastructure by the-eu.as of march 2021 manufacturing ==
other-sites include the-serum-institute of india at pune.
the-vaccine is marketed under the-brand-name covishield by the-serum-institute of india.
agreements for access to vaccines began being signed in may 2020, with the-uk having priority for the-first-100-million-doses if trials proved successful, with the-final-agreement being signed at the-end of august.
the-active-ingredients would be produced in argentina and sent to mexico to be completed for distribution.
in june 2020, emergent-biosolutions signed a-us$87-million-deal to manufacture doses of the-astrazeneca-vaccine specifically for the-us-market.
a-us$87-million-deal to manufacture doses of the-astrazeneca-vaccine specifically for the-us-market was part of the-trump-administration's-operation-warp-speed-initiative to develop and rapidly scale production of targeted-vaccines before the-end of 2020.
also, astrazeneca-and-serum-institute of india reached a-licensing-agreement to independently supply 1-billion-doses of the-oxford-university-vaccine to middle--and-low-income-countries, including india.
the-european-commission took over negotiations started by the-inclusive-vaccines-alliance, a-group made up of france, germany, italy, and the-netherlands, in june 2020.on 5 november 2020, a-tripartite-agreement was signed between the-government of bangladesh, the-serum-institute of india, and beximco-pharma of bangladesh.
under a-tripartite-agreement bangladesh ordered 30-million-doses of oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine from serum through beximco for $4 per shot.
on the-other-hand, indian-government has given 3.2-million-doses to bangladesh as a-gift which were also produced by serum.
bangladesh was supposed to receive 5-million-doses per month but not received shipments in march and april.
as a-result, rollout of vaccine has been disrupted by supply-shortfalls.
most-people who have received the-first-dose are not getting the-second-dose on time.
not getting the-second-dose at the-right-time is likely to reduce the-effectiveness of the-vaccination-program.
in addition, several-citizens of bangladesh have expressed doubts about bangladesh effectiveness and safety.
bangladesh is looking for alternative-vaccine-sources because india isn't supplying the-vaccine according to the-timeline of the-deal.
thailand's-agreement in november 2020 for 26-million-doses of vaccine would cover 13-million-people, approximately-20% of the-population, with the-first-lot expected to be delivered at the-end of may.
the-public-health-minister indicated the-price paid was $5 per dose; astrazeneca (thailand) explained in january 2021 after a-controversy that the-price each-country paid depended on production-cost and differences in supply-chain, including manufacturing-capacity, labour-and-raw-material-costs.
in january 2021, the-thai-cabinet approved further-talks on ordering another-35-million-doses, and the-thai-fda approved the-vaccine for emergency-use for 1-year.

the-vaccine arose from a-collaboration between oxford-university's-jenner-institute and vaccitech, a-private-company spun off from the-university, with financing from oxford-sciences-innovation, google-ventures, and sequoia-capital, among others.
in february 2020, the-jenner-institute agreed a-collaboration with the-italian-company advent-srl for the-production of a-batch of 1,000-doses of a-vaccine-candidate for clinical-trials.
originally, oxford intended to donate the-rights to manufacture and market the-vaccine to any-drugmaker who wanted to do so, but after the-gates-foundation urged oxford to find a-large-company-partner to get drugmaker-covid-19-vaccine to market, the-gates-foundation backed off of this-offer in may 2020.
an initially not-for-profit licencing agreement was signed between the-university and astrazeneca-plc, in may 2020, with 1-billion-doses of potential-supply secured, with the-uk reserving access to the-initial-100-million-doses.

in july 2020, astrazeneca partnered with iqvia to accelerate the-timeframe for clinical-trials being planned or conducted in the-us.
this was due to a-separate-investigation by the-food-and-drug-administration surrounding a-patient-illness that triggered a-clinical-hold, according to the-us-department of health and human-services (hhs)-secretary-alex-azar.
the-december-report showed that at 21-days after the-second-dose and beyond, there were no-hospitalisations or severe-disease in those who received the-vaccine, compared to 10-cases in the-control-groups.
one-case of transverse-myelitis was reported 14 days after the-second-dose was administered as being possibly related to vaccination, with an-independent-neurological-committee considering the-most-likely-diagnosis to be of an-idiopathic,-short-segment,-spinal-cord-demyelination.
a-subsequent-analysis, published on 19-february 2021, showed an-efficacy of 76.0% at preventing symptomatic covid-19 beginning at 22-days following the-first-dose, increasing to 81.3% when the-second-dose is given 12-weeks or more after the first.
efficacy was higher at greater-intervals between doses, peaking at around-80% when the-second-dose was given at 12-weeks or longer after the first.

the-same-report also indicated the deputy chief medical officer for england jonathan van-tam said researchers from the-university of the-witwatersrand
the-witwatersrand did not change the deputy chief medical officer for england jonathan van-tam opinion that the-astrazeneca-vaccine was "rather likely" to have an-effect on severe-disease from the-south-african-variant.
on 3-march 2021, austria suspended the-use of one-batch of vaccine after two-persons suffered blood-clots after vaccination, one of whom died.

on 23-april, citing the-current-state of supplies for mrna-based-vaccines and new-data, naci issued a-recommendation that the-vaccine can be offered to patients as young as 30 years old if benefits outweigh the-risks, and the-patient "does not wish to wait for an-mrna-vaccine".

according to the-pei, the-number of cases of cerebral-vein-thrombosis after vaccination was statistically significantly higher than the-number that would occur in the-general-population during a-similar-time-period.
the-world-health-organization (who) issued a-statement on 17-march, regarding the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-safety-signals, and still considers the-benefits of the-vaccine to outweigh the-world-health-organization (who) potential risks, further recommending that vaccinations continue.
on 18-march, the-ema the-ema announced that out of the-around-20-million-people who had received the-vaccine, general-blood-clotting-rates were normal, but that general-blood-clotting-rates had identified seven-cases of disseminated-intravascular-coagulation, and eighteen cases of cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis.

a-series of events from astrazeneca, including miscommunication, supply-difficulties, reports of adverse-effects, national-rollout-suspensions, and politics including the-high-profile-european-commission–astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine dispute, have been a-public-relations-disaster, and in the-opinion of one-academic has led to increased-vaccine-hesitancy.
increased-vaccine-hesitancy remains a-key-component of the-who backed covax (covid-19 vaccines-global-access) program, with the-who, the-ema, and the-mhra continuing to state that the-benefits of increased-vaccine-hesitancy outweigh any-possible-side-effects.
as of february 2021, the-azd1222-development-team is working on adapting the-vaccine to be more effective in relation to newer-covid-19-variants; redesigning the-vaccine being the-relatively-quick-process of switching the-genetic-sequence of the-spike-protein.

covid-19 testing can be used to track the-prevalence and spread, to diagnose individuals for treatment, to identify infections for isolation and contact-tracing, to screen at-risk populations, to clear exposed-healthcare-workers to return to work, and to identify individuals with potential-immunity.
on april 23, trudeau identified broader-testing as key to reopening the-country, mentioning the-target of 60,000-tests per day set by dr.-theresa-tam, but warned that up to 120,000 per day may be required.
total-numbers of tests conducted for the-provinces and canada show that over-800,000-canadians have been tested as of early-may 2020.
the-displayed-chart shows the-testing-rates per capita in the-provinces and territories from march to may 2020.
role of the-government of canada ===
since this is usually a-lengthy-process, on march 18, minister of health hajdu issued an-interim-order to allow expedited-access to covid-19-related-medical-devices for use by healthcare-providers, including diagnostic-test-kits.
as of april 30, 21-diagnostic-device-applications were listed as submitted by health-canada.
samples from suspected-cases early in the-pandemic were sent by provinces and territories to this-national-lab for testing, either as the-sole-test or as a-check of an in-province test result.
the-first-confirmed-case in canada was diagnosed by this-national-lab for testing on january 27, 2020.
since then, provinces and territories have established provinces-and-territories-own-testing-capacity but have occasionally sent samples to this-national-lab for testing for a-second-test as a-check.
federal-facilitation of testing ====
in late-april, the-federal-government arranged for a-cargo-flight from china that delivered the-equivalent of about-six-to-nine-months of production for one-particular-raw-material for the-20-odd-raw-materials needed by supplier-luminultra to supply reagent-kits for rt-pcr-machines.
health-canada identifies nucleic-acid-based-testing as "the-gold-standard used in canada and abroad, for the-diagnosis of active-covid-19-infection in patients with symptoms. "
the-predominant-type of testing used is rt-pcr.
on april 15, trudeau announced that luminultra-technologies-ltd. of fredericton would be "ramping up production ... to meet the-weekly-demand in all-provinces."
on april 13, health-canada approved this-test, but on may 3 this-test was recalled due to unreliable-results.
precision-biomonitoring of guelph signed a-letter of intent on march 31 with the-federal-government to co-develop a novel point-of-care test kit for covid‑19, which is now pending an-authorization from health-canada.
since bio-id-diagnostics of edmonton is based on sequencing dna bio-id-diagnostics of edmonton avoids false-positives, and bio-id-diagnostics of edmonton detects a-low-concentration of the-virus substantially reducing false-negatives in asymptomatic-individuals.
on october 5, health-canada approved a-portable-pcr-test — the-hyris-bcube —which was based on technology developed at the-university of guelph and can process tests in 90-minutes.
health-canada wrote that the-first-antibody-test approved for use, a-laboratory-test from diasorin, an-italian-multinational-biotechnology-company will "contribute to a-better-understanding of whether people who have been infected are immune to the-virus."
as of april 20, the-who estimated that at most-2-to-3-percent of people in affected-countries have been infected.
on april 23, 2020, trudeau created a-covid-19-immunity-task-force of researchers, including dr.-tam, dr.-david-naylor, and dr.-mona-nemer, to coordinate monitoring of immunity and vulnerability to covid-19 in the-canadian-population.
tests for antigens, proteins that are part of the-surface of the-virus, were first approved by health-canada on october 6, when the-virus approved and ordered 20.5-million-units of one manufactured by abbott-laboratories as a point-of-care test.

the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign in the-united-states is an-ongoing-mass-immunization-campaign to respond to the-covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states.
following the-fda's-approval of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine on december 10, 2020, mass-vaccinations began on december 14, 2020.
the pfizer–biontech covid-19 vaccine was later approved for use on december 17, 2020, and the-johnson-&-johnson-covid-19-vaccine was approved for use on february 27
, 2021.the-campaign was initiated by the-u.s.-government under the-presidency of donald-trump, and transitioned to joe-biden, who became the-new-president of the-united-states on january 20, 2021.
this-goal was met on march 19, 2021.
on march 25, 2021, biden announced biden would set a-new-covid-19-vaccine-goal of 200-million-shots being given within biden first 100 days in office.
a-new-covid-19-vaccine-goal of 200-million-shots being given within his-first-100-days in office was met on april 21, 2021.
vaccines were distributed to states on a-population-basis, with the-vaccine-rollouts being administered by each-individual-u.s.-state.
on february 1, 2021, the-department of homeland-security said the-department of homeland-security "fully support[s] equal access to the-covid-19-vaccines and vaccine-distribution-sites for undocumented-immigrants" and that related-federal-agencies "will not conduct enforcement-operations at or near vaccine-distribution-sites or clinics.
while , generally, the-united-states may have intended that vaccines be prioritized for residents rather than for tourists—especially-international-visitors—there was some-difficulty communicating and enforcing this.
most-adults have driver's-licenses, but many do not, and otherwise the-united-states doesn't automatically provide each-citizen with identity-documentation in a-centralized-system.
furthermore, when people did not show up for people-vaccine-appointments, many-clinics vaccinated anyone else who happened to show up so that the-doses would not be wasted.
diplomats pointed out that the-b1/b2-tourist-visa allows people to seek medical-treatment while within the-us, even if people do not turn out to be eligible for the-covid-19-vaccine.
by march 18, tests had begun with dozens of volunteers in seattle, sponsored by the-u.s.-government, and similar-safety-trials were planned for other-potential-vaccines.
bill-gates, whose-foundation shifted whose-foundation focus nearly entirely to the-pandemic, anticipated in early 2020 that a-vaccine could be ready by early 2021.on august 5, 2020, the-united-states agreed to pay johnson and johnson more than $1 billion to create a-hundred-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine.
a-hundred-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine gave the-united-states an-option to order an additional two hundred million.
ultimately,-strict-fda-guidelines that could help ensure the-safety and public-uptake of the-vaccine emerged from the-office of management and budget and were published on the-fda-website.
as of october 2020, 44 were in clinical-trials on humans, and 91-pre-clinical-vaccines were being tested on animals.
on november 20, 2020, the-pfizer–biontech-partnership submitted a-request for emergency-use-authorization to the-food-and-drug-administration (fda), and fda-fda announced that fda-vaccines and related-biological-products-advisory-committee (vrbpac) would review a-request for emergency-use-authorization to the-food-and-drug-administration (fda).
on december 11, the-fda granted emergency-use-authorization for the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine.
an-initial-shipment of 2.9-million-doses were scheduled to be distributed rapidly, and pfizer promised to continue supplying the-rest of the-hundred-million-doses through march 2021.
pfizer had adequate-stocks available and began this-distribution on december 17, 2020, but the-federal-government reduced the-amount that pfizer was allowed to distribute.
on december 18, 2020, the-fda the-fda granted the-moderna-vaccine-emergency-use-authorization, which moderna had requested on november 30, 2020.
the-u.s. planned to rapidly distribute 5.9-million-doses with more to come later.
however, the-johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine has faced backlash from some-government-officials, believing the-johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine to be not as effective as pfizer or moderna.
on march 5, duggan, rejected a-shipment of the-johnson & the-johnson & johnson vaccine, saying, "moderna and pfizer are the best.
and i am going to do everything i can to make sure the-residents of the-city of detroit get the best."
on march 11, 2021, president-joe-biden announced in an-address that president-joe-biden would direct all-states to make vaccines available to all-adults no later than may 1.
on april 6, 2021, president-joe-biden stated that president-joe-biden would direct states to make all-adults eligible for vaccination by april 19, nearly two weeks before the-original-date of may 1.

covid-19 community-quarantines in the-philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon-sanitaire-measures implemented by the-government of the-philippines through the-philippines inter-agency task force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
the strictest of community-quarantines in the-philippines is the-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq), which effectively is a-total-lockdown.
given the-rapidly-increasing-number of cases in metro-manila,
albay-2nd-district-representative-joey-salceda proposed a-week-long-lockdown of the-region to prevent the-disease from spreading nationwide.
albay-2nd-district-representative-joey-salceda specifically proposed the-closure of the-philippine-expressway-network and public-transportation accessing the-region, in addition to the-suspension of classes and work.
president-duterte initially rejected the-proposal claiming president-duterte would "hamper the-flow of basic-commodities".
secretary-duque, however, raised the-possibility of a-lockdown on certain-cities or towns if cases of community-based-transmissions are reported, but not an entire region.
on march 12, president-duterte announced a-partial-lockdown covering metro-manila, that began on march 15.
at one-point during president-rodrigo-duterte's-pronouncement about the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine," president-duterte said that "they are afraid to call the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine a-lockdown, but the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine is a-lockdown."
secretary-eduardo-año of the-department of interior and local government (dilg) also said that "enhanced-community-quarantine" should be considered as a-"total-lockdown. "
addition, president-duterte advised local-government-units outside of the-national-capital-region to implement a-community-quarantine in cases where, in a-given-level of local-government, at-least-two-covid-19-cases are confirmed within a-lower-level of local-government jurisdiction; for example, a-province-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-cities or municipalities in the-same-province, while a-city/municipality-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-barangays in the-same-city or municipality.
local-government has given local-government units under enhanced-community-quarantine in visayas and mindanao and relevant-field-offices of the-department of health the-power to lift or extend the-lockdown-period in local-government units jurisdiction.
on april 6, the-following-localities were under enhanced-community-quarantine: all-regions of luzon, western-visayas, caraga-region, zamboanga-peninsula, samar, biliran, cebu, negros-oriental, camiguin, bukidnon, sultan-kudarat, lanao-del-sur, lanao-del-norte, cotabato, south cotabato, tawi-tawi, and the-municipality of catarman in northern samar.
on april 24, it was clarified that local-government-units can no longer impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
although exact-measures per level may vary over time due to the-government revising the-government guidelines, the strictest of exact-measures per level is the-ecq and the most lenient being the-mgcq.
ecq was reintroduced in march 2021 in the-greater-manila-area (or ncr plus as designated by the-iatf-eid); new-set of measures were observed.
people aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant-women are barred from going out pregnant-women homes except to either obtain essential-goods and services or to report for work.
in addition to front-line-services (health and other-emergency-services); full-operations is allowed for certain-operations including agriculture,-forestry,-aquaculture-and-delivery-and-courier-services of essential-goods.
however, with the-ecq-period in march-april 2021 coinciding with the-holy-week and late-release of guidelines of the-department of transportation, this resulted in the-virtual-absence of public-transportation in some-areas.
a-level under gcq, is called a modified general community quarantine (mgcq).sporting activities has been allowed in areas under gcq since july 2020, although live-spectators are not allowed for sports-events.
prior to the-imposition of the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon, a-more-lenient-measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a-curfew, was imposed in metro-manila and was officially called a "community quarantine".
in may 2020, additional-terms were coined by the-government to categorize the-community-quarantine according to the-government risk assessment and those-new-terms are "modified-enhanced-community-quarantine,"-"modified-general-community-quarantine" and "new normal. "
a-"total-lockdown"-measure, distinct from an-ecq, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving people places of residence and mandate the-closure of all-public-establishments.
according to presidential-spokesperson-harry-roque, a-"total-lockdown"-measure, distinct from an-ecq, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving their-places of residence and mandate the-closure of all-public-establishments is considered as an-option.
a-classification of measures called "new normal", a-level under mgcq, was introduced sometime in june 2020, but has not yet been used.
an-indefinite-enhanced-community-quarantine, was imposed in caraga, alternatively known as one shield caraga, started on april 7, and in the-davao-region which took effect on april 4.provinces that imposed an-enhanced-community-quarantine include iloilo (march 21), antique (march 22), negros-occidental (march 30), cebu (march 30), and negros-oriental (april 3).the independent cities of bacolod (march 30), iloilo city (march 21), and cebu city (march 28) also imposed ecq-measures.

lockdowns, or community-quarantines, have been imposed throughout the-country since march 15, 2020 as a-measure to limit the-spread of the-virus.
as of april 29, 2021, the-philippines has reported 1,028,738-cases of the-disease.
the-largest-single-day-increase in the-number of confirmed-cases was reported on april 2, 2021, when the-department of health (doh) announced 15,310-new-cases.
the-philippines had a-slightly-lower-testing-capacity than the-philippines neighbors in southeast-asia during the-first-months of the-pandemic in the-philippines.
by the-end of january 2020, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa, metro-manila began metro-manila testing operations and became the-country's-first-subnational-laboratory.
several-laboratories have been accredited by the-doh the-doh since then.
as of april 25, the-country has 249-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting the-sars-cov-2-virus and has conducted a-total of 11,581,020-tests from more-than-10,882,337-unique-individuals.
january to february 2020 ===
the-philippines reported the-philippines first suspected case of covid-19 in january 2020.
it involved a-5-year-old-boy in cebu, who arrived in the-country on january 12 with the-boy-mother.
at that-time, the-philippines had no-capability to conduct covid-19-tests.
samples from the-boy were also sent to the-victorian-infectious-disease-reference-laboratory in melbourne, australia to determine the-specific-coronavirus-strain.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases started conducting confirmatory-tests on january-30.the-first-case of covid-19 in the-philippines was confirmed on the-same-day.
the-diagnosed-patient was a-38-year-old-chinese-woman from wuhan, who had arrived in manila from hong-kong on january 21.
the-diagnosed-patient was admitted to the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila on january 25 after the-diagnosed-patient sought a-consultation due to a-mild-cough.
the-second-case was confirmed on february 2, a 44-year-old chinese male who was the-companion of the-first-case.
a-44-year-old-chinese-male who was the-companion of the-first-case-death on february 1 was the first recorded outside china.
a-44-year-old-chinese-male who was the-companion of the-first-case suffered from coinfection with influenza-and-streptococcus-pneumoniae.
on february 5, the-doh confirmed a-third-case in a-60-year-old-chinese-woman who flew into cebu-city from hong-kong on january 20 before she traveled to bohol where she consulted a-doctor at a-private-hospital on january 22, due to fever and rhinitis.
samples taken from the-patient on january 24 returned a-negative-result, but the-doh the-doh was notified on february 3 that samples taken from the-patient on january 23 tested positive for the-virus.
the-patient upon recovery on january 31 was allowed to go home to china.
march 2020 ===
after a-month of reporting no-new-cases, on march 6, the-doh announced two-cases consisting of two-filipinos.
one is a-48-year-old-man with a-travel-history to japan, returning on february 25 and reported symptoms on march 3.
the other is a-60-year-old-man with a-history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on february 25 and was admitted to a-hospital on march 1 when he experienced pneumonia.
he confirmed that the-fifth-case had no-travel-history outside the-philippines and is, therefore, the-first-case of local-transmission.
since then, the-department of health recorded a-continuous-increase in the-number of covid-19-cases in the-country.
cases abroad involving foreigners with travel-history in the-philippines were reported in early-march 2020.
the-first-three-recorded-cases involving an-australian, a-japanese, and a-taiwanese-national had a-history of visiting the-philippines in february 2020.
though it was unconfirmed whether or-not-the-first-three-recorded-cases involving an-australian, a-japanese, and a-taiwanese-national had contracted the-virus while in the-philippines, speculations arose on undetected-local-transmissions in the-philippines due to prior-confirmation of the-philippines first case of local-transmission.
retrospective-studies have been made to determine the-strain of virus responsible for causing the-community-outbreak of covid-19 in the-philippines since march 2020.
in may 2020, edsel-salvaña, director of the-institute of molecular-biology and biotechnology and member of the-iatf-eid, said that the-strain responsible for the-covid-19-outbreak in the-country that started in march 2020 is closely related to the-strain affecting india at the-time.
the-virus-strain's-family-tree is said by salvaña to have appeared in china and australia.
genetic-sequence-analysis of samples collected from philippine-general-hospital-patients from march 22–28 suggest that there are at-least-two-sources of viral-transmission in the-philippines; china, mainly from shanghai and from japan specifically through repatriated-filipino-seafarers of the-diamond-princess-cruise-ship.
several-measures were imposed to mitigate the-spread of the-disease in china, including bans on travel to mainland china, hong-kong, macau, and south-korea.
on march 7, 2020, the-department of health (doh) raised the-department of health (doh) "
code-red-sub-level 1," with a-recommendation to the-president of the-philippines to impose a-"public-health-emergency" authorizing the-doh to mobilize resources for the-procurement of safety-gear and the-imposition of preventive-quarantine-measures.
on march 9, president-rodrigo-duterte issued proclamation no.
on march 12, president-rodrigo-duterte declared "code red sub-level 2," issuing a-partial-lockdown on metro-manila to prevent a-nationwide-spread of covid-19.
the-lockdowns were expanded on march 16, placing the-entirety of luzon under an-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq).
on march 17, president-duterte issued proclamation no.
929, declaring the-philippines under a-state of calamity for a-tentative-period of six-months.
on march 20, four-facilities, namely-the-southern-philippines-medical-center in davao-city, vicente-sotto-memorial-medical-center in cebu-city, baguio-general-hospital and medical-center in benguet, and the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila (where the-first-case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the-ritm.
on march 25, the-president signed the-bayanihan to heal as one-act, which gave the-president additional-powers to handle the-outbreak.
april to may 2020 ==
by april, covid-19 had spread to all-17-regions of the-philippines, with the-confirmation of a-case in april 6 of a-patient confined at a-hospital in surigao-city who had been in the-caraga-region since march 12 after traveling from manila.
president-duterte on april 7 accepted the-recommendation of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) to extend the-ecq in luzon until april 30.on april 17
, it was reported that the-country had been able to bring down the-viral-disease'-reproduction-number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the-average-number of people a-person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one.
recent-data at the-time suggested that the-country was doing better in "flattening the-curve", but was warned of a-"resurgence" and must ramp up mass-testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further-transmission of covid-19.sometime in late-april, local-government-units (lgus) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-iatf-eid.
prior to that-period, lgus could impose such-measures in coordination with the-department of the-interior-and-local-government.
in the-philippines, tens-of-thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the-dual-threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex-and-dangerous-evacuation.
at each-shelter in the-central-part of the-philippines, in order to prevent the-spread of coronavirus-infection, only-half of the-capacity was accepted, and a-mask was required when evacuating.
by the-time typhoon-vongfong landed, the-number of confirmed-infections was 11,618 and the-number of deaths (due to infectious-diseases) was 772 in the-philippines.
=== june to july 2020 ===
quarantine-measures raised throughout the-country started to loosen up on june 1, with areas formerly under ecq transitioning to a-less-strict-quarantine.
this led to a-significant-rise in the-number of confirmed-cases, as more-areas implemented a-gcq.
the-official-start of classes in the-elementary-and-secondary-schools which customarily begin on june was postponed.
according to the-national-government, the-law expired on june 25, due to the-law sunset provision although there were interpretations that the-law expired as early as june 5.
the-national-government maintains that the-law was to expire on june 25.
the-doh reported an-overwhelmingly-high-number of recoveries on july 30, as the-department began the-department "oplan-recovery" to clear out the-department discrepancies with lgu-counts.
under the-data-reconciliation of the-doh, starting from july 15, mild-cases and asymptomatic-cases will be recorded as recovered after 14-days from swab-collection for testing.
the-first-set of "mass-recovery" was recorded on july 30 with 37,180-recoveries.
from july 30, recovery-reconciliations will be reported every 15 days.
august 2020 ==
on august 2, the-philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the-country continues to report around 2,000–3,000-cases a day.
a-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq) was placed in metro-manila, bulacan, cavite, laguna, and rizal from august 4 to 18 as a-response to the-petition of medical-front-liners requesting an-ecq in metro-manila.
in early-august, the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) became involved in a-corruption-scandal, and the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) executives were alleged to have used the-pandemic as a-cover-up to steal billions of pesos.
a-new-variant of the-sars-cov-2-virus originating in the-philippines is said to be globally-dominant-variant than other-variants of the-sars-cov-2-virus originating in the-philippines at the-time of detection and has been associated with the-sudden-increase of new-cases in july.
by august 18, the-doh has identified 1,302-covid-19-clusters throughout the-country with the-majority being located in metro-manila.
september to november 2020 ==
on september 11, president-duterte signed republic-act
president-duterte then extended the-period of the-state of calamity until september 2021, through president-duterte proclamation
also announced on september 18 that all-cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial-parks nationwide will be closed from october 29 to november 4 to prevent social-gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the-all-saints'-day-observance.
covid-19 has spread to all-provinces in the-philippines by september 28, when batanes recorded covid-19 first-case.
december 2020 ==
the-philippines also banned travel from 19-other-nations which has reported cases of more-infectious-variants of sars-cov-2.the-doh announced in a-briefing held in january 2021 that a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 is already in the-philippines as early as december 2020.
one of the-samples collected by the-health-department on december 10 tested positive for the-variant on january 21, 2021.
january 2021 ==
by january 2021, the-doh is already monitoring at-least-two-other-noted-mutations aside from the-u.k.-variant, namely-the-501.v2-variant which originated from south-africa and another-variant from malaysia.
on january 5, 2021, hong-kong reported that they detected the-variant from a-30-year-old-woman who arrived in the-city from the-philippines on december 22, 2020, raising concerns that the-strain may already be in the-philippines.
–pgc-study said that it has not detected the-u.k.-variant among 305-samples collected from november to december-hospital-admissions involving inbound-travellers who have tested positive for covid-19 upon arrival in the-country.
epidemiologist-john-wong, who is part of doh's-technical-advisory-working-group, said in a-press-briefing on january 6 that if lineage-b.1.1.7 establishes lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-philippines, the-total-number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold.
in the-first-scenario, covid-19 has a-r-rate of 1.1 and the-u.k.-variant does not reach the-philippines which project an-increase of cases to 32,000 by the-end of the-month.
in the-second-scenario where lineage-b.1.1.7 does indeed establish lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-country, the-projected-rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the-same-time-period.
on january 13, the-doh announced that the-u.k.-variant has been detected in the-country when a-29-year-old-man from quezon-city, who arrived in the-country from the-united-arab-emirates on january 7, tested positive for covid-19.
on january 22, 16-new-cases associated with the-u.k.-variant has been confirmed in several-places in country including benguet, laguna, and mountain-province.
covid-19-vaccines on january 14 and 28, respectively.
february 2021 ==
on february 18, the-doh in central-visayas announced that two-mutations of sars-cov-2 were discovered in cebu.
march 2021 ===
the-doh announced the-detection of the-south-african-variant of sars-cov-2 in pasay on march 2.
on march 12, lineage-p.1, commonly known as the-brazilian-variant, was detected in the-country, along with a-"unique"-variant originating from the-philippines which was designated as the-p.3-variant, which in turn related to the-aforementioned-variant.
as a-response to the-recent-spike in cases, the-greater-manila-area, which the-government called "ncr plus", was placed under general-community-quarantine (gcq) on march 22 and was originally set to expire on april 4.
it was further intensified to general-community-quarantine (gcq) from march 29 to april 11, when the-positivity-rate of the-area remained high.
on march 17, the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa) reported that there have been at-least-27,967-deaths caused by, or associated with, covid-19 by the-end of 2020.
the-discrepancy between the-tallies of the-doh and the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa) is due to the-inclusion of probable-and-suspect-cases in the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa)'s tally.
april 2021 ==
on april 2, the-philippines has logged 15,310-new-cases, the-highest-number of daily-cases since the-beginning of the-pandemic.
cases == ===
metro-manila, having over-430,000-cases and 6,000-deaths, is considered as the-epicenter of the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-country is attributed to the-region.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-country is followed by the-neighboring-calabarzon-and-central-luzon-regions with a-combined-total of 254,064-cases.
bangsamoro, on the-other-hand, has the-lowest-number of cases in the-country.
as of april 25, 2021, there have been 17,365-healthcare-workers that tested positive for covid-19.
on the-early-months of the-pandemic in the-country, the-number of healthcare-workers infected by the-virus was significantly higher compared to the-infection-rate of other-health-care-workers in the-western-pacific-region.
by january 2021, the-sars-cov-2-virus had infected more-than-9,381-police-officers from the-philippine-national-police (pnp), 1,137-military-personnel from the-armed-forces of the-philippines (afp), and 160-members of the-presidential-security-group (psg).
home-provinces has been associated to new-clusters of the-disease in previously-least-affected-regions.
of the 1,098,954 returning overseas-filipinos (rof) reported on april 25, 2021, 1,093,400 have tested negative for the-disease and have been discharged from quarantine-facilities, while 16,614 have tested positive.
the-department of foreign-affairs (dfa) provides information regarding the-number of filipino-nationals abroad to have contracted covid-19.
the-dfa keeps an-official-tally of confirmed-filipino covid-19-cases per region instead of by country.
as of april 26, 2021 there have been 18,253-overseas-filipinos from 93-countries and territories that tested positive for covid-19.
this-count is not included in the-national-tally of cases by the-doh.
the-doh previously used the-designation "patients under investigation" (puis) and "persons under monitoring" (pums) to manage suspected-and-confirmed-cases.
puis involved individuals who had a-travel-history to wuhan but by february 3, 2020,
the-doh has expanded the-scope of puis to include individuals who had a-travel-history to any-part of china.
on april 11, 2020, the-doh the-doh revised the-doh terminology for puis; "suspect" and "probable"-cases.
patients admitted to a-hospital due to severe-symptoms caused by an-undetermined-lung-disease could also be tagged as a-suspect-case.
probable-cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further-validation, and those who were tested but whose-test was not facilitated in an-official-laboratory for a-reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction-test.
by july 14, 2020, there had been 38,909-suspected-cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the-philippines.
the-doh has issued a-reminder, that level 2 and 3-hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have covid-19-infection and refusal of admission is a-"violation of the-signed-performance-commitment and shall be dealt with by the-philhealth accordingly".
the-department said that level 2 and 3-hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild-covid-19-symptoms while individuals in a-serious-or-critical-condition may be transferred to one of the-doh's-three-main-referral-hospitals, which was increased over time to 75-designated-hospitals as of april 13 with a-combined-bed-capacity of 3,194.
on march 16, the-doh announced a-revision on their-protocol on hospital-admission for covid-19-positive-patients.
the-doh has began sending both-asymptomatic-patients and individuals with mild-symptoms back on their-homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until their have been deemed recovered.
dr.-marissa-alejandria of the-philippine-society of microbiology-and-infectious-disease is the-philippines'-representative in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire as the-official-liaison of the-doh in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire.
the-department of science and technology (dost) announced that the-department of science and technology (dost) is seeking bilateral-collaboration with other-countries such as china, russia, south-korea, taiwan, and the-united-kingdom on endeavors related to the-vaccine-development for covid-19.
the-philippine-council on health-research and development at the-dost plans to distribute an-undisclosed-"functional-food," while presidential-spokesman-harry-roque also revealed that the-dost, philippine-general-hospital, and the-ateneo-de-manila-university, are collaborating with the-duke–nus-medical-school in singapore to evaluate the-feasibility of lauric-acid from virgin-coconut-oil, vitex-negundo (known locally as lagundi), and euphorbia-hirta (known locally as tawa-tawa) as a-"dietary-regimen-supplement" to help covid-19-patients combat the-disease.
india is projected to at-least-60-million-doses from various-manufacturers in 2021.the-procurement-efforts of the-national-government has been a-subject of various-controversies.
health-secretary-francisco-duque has been alleged to "dropped the-ball" in a-deal with pfizer-vaccine-deal which could have secured 10-million-doses by as early as january 2021.
late-stage-trials of china's-sinovac's-vaccine in brazil reported an-efficacy-rate of only-50-percent.
the-department of health said that sinovac's-vaccine satisfy the world health organization standards of at-least-50-percent-efficacy-rate while the-department of health pointed out that sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on their-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for the-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for sinovac's-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey.
on december 2, 2020, president-rodrigo-duterte signed an-executive-order allowing the-food-and-drug-administration to grant emergency-use-authorization (eua) to covid-19 vaccines and treatments.
under certain-conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a-month instead of undergoing the-usual-six-month-review-process.
the-fda announced that three-vaccine manufactures namely-pfizer, astrazeneca, and sinovac have inquired on the-process of obtaining an-eua in the-philippines.
on december 23, pfizer has applied for an-eua for an-eua vaccine.
duterte also said in december 2020 that some-members of the-military already received covid-19-vaccine from chinese-manufacturer, sinopharm despite the-vaccine not yet officially approved by the-country's-health-authorities.
few days later, duterte was reported that some-members of the-presidential-security-group had also received vaccine from unknown-manufacturer.
testing ===
early covid-19 testing in the-philippines was only limited to persons with travel-history to countries with cases of local-transmission and those with exposure to the-individuals confirmed to have covid-19.
on march 30, symptomatic-healthcare-workers are also considered priority for testing.
all of those coming from abroad, (3)-all-close-contacts of confirmed-cases that were found through contact-tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid-antibody-tests.
the-government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the-philippines'-entire-population and 10–12% of the-worst-affected-region in the-country, which is metro-manila.
in late-march 2020, some-politicians and their-relatives were reportedly tested for the-disease despite not showing any-symptoms, causing public-backlash amidst a-shortage of testing-kits since the-disease was against doh-guidelines to test asymptomatic-individuals.
doh-doh responded to the-public-criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no-policy for vip-treatment" with regard to testing for covid-19 and that "all-specimens are being processed on a-first-in,-first-out-basis," it "extends courtesy" to front-line-government-officials, specifically those involved in national-security and public-health.
some-senators who were tested claim that some-senators who were tested claim that they used rapid-antibody-tests not accredited by the-doh at that-time used rapid-antibody-tests not accredited by doh-doh at that-time.
on january 24, 2021, after receiving a-go-signal from the-national-government, the-philippine-red-cross announced that the-philippine-red-cross will start conducting covid-19-tests using saliva-samples on january 25.
in july 2020, there were currently 85-testing-laboratories nationwide with 25,000-tests conducted daily.
the-country has conducted over-3-million-tests as of september 2020.on march 9, 2020, a-total-of-2,000-tests has been conducted at a-rate of 200-to-250-people accommodated by tests per day.
as of march 23, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa alone can test 600-people per day, other-laboratories except for the-facility of san-lazaro-hospital, manila, can do 100-tests, while the-said-hospital can do 50-tests per day.
by march 27, the-release of test-results conducted at the-ritm takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the-institute is committed to reducing the-turnaround to two-to-three-days.
the-doh announced that the-philippines will conduct targeted-mass-testing on april 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible,-probable,-and-high-risk-patients, such as health-workers, expectant-mothers, and patients with other-medical-conditions.
the-philippines's-testing continuously increased, except when the-ritm temporarily scaled down the-ritm operations from april 20–24 after 43 of the-ritm staffs tested positive for the-virus.
the-philippines has the-capability to conduct mass-testing, either through reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) or rapid-antibody-testing, given the-increased-number and improving capacity of the-philippines's accredited laboratories and the-procurement of more-testing-kits.
the-first-localized-targeted-mass-testing began in valenzuela, metro-manila on april 11.
the-food-and-drug-administration has approved the-usage of 75-pcr-test-kits (including one-locally-developed-kit), 79-rapid-antibody-testing-kits, 53-immunoassay-testing-kits, and 7-other-testing-kits as of july 30.
a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit has been made by the-national-institutes of health at the-university of the-philippines-manila.
it was first approved for commercial-use in april 2020 by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) but some-kits were recalled in may by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) manufacturer, after the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) was found out that testing using some-kits yields indeterminate-results 30 percent at the-time.
before january 30, there were no-medical-facilities in the-country that can confirm cases of the-virus.
sars-cov-2.the-national-task-force for covid-19 cited the-san-miguel-corporation as a-pioneer in the-move to open the-san-miguel-corporation covid-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of the-san-miguel-corporation 70,000-employees.
as of august 24, the-country has 110-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting sars-cov-2.
from may 29 to june 17, 2020, the-doh had included testing-backlogs on their-daily-case-bulletin.
late-cases were reported alongside new-cases or "fresh-cases", which corresponded to the-cases that were validated three days within the-release of test-results.
this-change was implemented by the-health-department to clarify the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country.
the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country the-country has been accounted to the-backlog in late-june 2020, when 2,434-new-cases were announced.
the-national-government declared a-state of calamity over all of the-philippines on march 16, 2020, by virtue of proclamation
the-declaration brings into effect for six-months the following: price-control of basic-needs and commodities, granting interest-free-loans, distribution of calamity-funds,
following the-sharp-increase of confirmed-cases, president-duterte called on congress to hold special-sessions on march 23 to enact the-bayanihan to heal as one-act upon president-duterte request, which would authorize duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a-budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the-estimated-₱438-billion-($8.55-billion)-national-budget approved for 2020, in response to the-pandemic.
president-duterte signed the-bill into law on march 25.
law was effective for three-months until june 25, owing to law-sunset-provision.
on august 20, the-bicameral-committee approved a-reconciled-version of the-bill.
the-bicameral-committee was signed into law by president-duterte on september 11.
the-government has varying-levels of lockdown and/or stay-at-home orders across all-the-country's-local-government-units characterized as "community-quarantines".
restrictions were imposed on various-aspects of society such as mass-public-transportation, mass-gathering, and operation of businesses.
in april 2020, president-rodrigo-duterte warned anyone who violates the-country's-lockdown-measures could be shot for causing trouble.

based on the-number of cases and fatality-rate ===
according to the-study by the-covid-19-pandemic-response-team of the-university of the-philippines (up) released on april 13, 2020, the-implementation of the-luzon-wide-ecq has been effective to slowing down the-spread of the-coronavirus even if the-spread of the-coronavirus predicted that there would be around-9,000-to-44,000-cases by the-end of april 2020.
greatly relying on the-work being done on finding new-cases is the-key to evaluating the-effectiveness of the-ecq.
although, the-up-response-team added that the-next-courses of actions will not be solely dependent on the-number of cases.
the-effectiveness can also be determined by fatality-rate, which is 5.38% and the-reproduction-number is 0.6398; with those-figures as of april 10, the-study declared that the-ecq has been effective.
furthermore, the-study provided a-matrix for the-lgus that can be the-basis of the-study decision on what quarantine methods the-study can use after the-supposed-end of the-ecq on april 30 for continued-effectiveness.
there are four-proposed-courses of action namely-no-quarantine, general-community-quarantine, enhanced-community-quarantine, and extreme enhanced-community-quarantine that would be dependent on the-probability of outbreak and the-ratio of confirmed-cases to estimated-outbreak-threshold.
the-san-miguel-corporation, which is one of co-operators of the-expressways in the-philippines, said on april 3 that during the-first-14-days of the-luzon-lockdown, the-volume of vehicles dropped to 80% in the-south-luzon-expressway (slex).
however, on april 15, iatf-spokesperson-nograles said that the-number of private-vehicles that ply over edsa and other-major-thoroughfares got bigger after one-month of the-luzon-ecq as the-number of motorists defying the-lockdown-guidelines exceeded 108,000.
it was reported on april 2 that people violating curfew-rules reached around 20,000 according to the-pnp.
duterte warned the-public that there would be martial-law-like-lockdown if people continues to disobey ecq-rules, specifically-social-distancing and curfew.
some of those-violations include crowded-markets in metro-manila and holding of cockfighting-and-boxing-events.
in other-quarantine-rules, the-imposition of window-hours risked violating the-social-distancing-guidelines since more-people would go to the-markets at the-same-time; thus, the-dilg directed lgus to discontinue observing the window-hours (where people go out only on specific-few-hours during the-day).

similar-restrictions were established to reduce the-spread of the-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
by april 2020, about-half of the-world's-population was under lockdown, with more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories-governments.
research-and-case-studies have shown that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of covid-19.
to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-who recommends a-response to the-pandemic that consists of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.
countries and territories around the-world have enforced lockdowns of varying-stringency.
some include total-movement-control while others have enforced restrictions based on time.
beginning with the-first-lockdown in china's-hubei-province in january 2020 and the-entirety of italy in march, lockdowns continued to be implemented in many-countries throughout 2020 and 2021.
on 24-march 2020, the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india was ordered to stay at home during the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india lockdown, making the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india the largest of the-pandemic.
several-researchers, from modelling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of, and
deaths caused by, covid-19.
lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing covid-19-community-transmission, healthcare-costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater-stringency, and when not lifted too early.
a-study investigating the-spread based on studies of the-most-common-symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in france, italy and the-uk showed a-marked-decrease in new-symptoms just a few days after the-start of confinement on the-countries (italy and france) with the-strongest-lockdowns.
the-relatively-high-number of cases and deaths in sweden, which has kept much of sweden society open during the-united-states-pandemic, when compared to sweden neighbors with comparable-demographics norway, denmark and finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to at least partly attributable to this-difference in policy.
similarly, modelling on australian-data concluded that achieving zero-community-transmission through a-strict-lockdown lowers healthcare-and-economic-costs compared to less-stringent-measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early-relaxation of restrictions have greater-costs.
this-"zero-community-transmission"-approach was adopted in australia, and a-strict-four-month-lockdown in the-state of victoria during an-outbreak in melbourne, combined with other-measures, averted a-wider-outbreak in australia.
one-study led by an-economist at the-university of chicago found that involuntary-lockdowns had little-impact, with voluntary-distancing making up nearly-90% of the-fall in consumer-traffic as people feared the-virus itself.
similarly, a-nber-study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just-5–10%.
has been criticized, among other-things for having a-country-specific-adjustment-factor, without which the-model would predict a-massive-number of deaths for sweden.
another-study that compared the-impact of 'less-restrictive-interventions' on the-spread of covid-19 in sweden and south-korea, with mandatory stay-at home-orders in 8-other-countries, such as france and spain, did not find evidence for greater-disease-control in the-countries with more-restrictions.
an-analysis of an-outbreak in northern-italy found that an-effective-reduction in community-transmission occurred during a-strict-national-lockdown, and that earlier-less-stringent-measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a-level low enough to reduce the-spread of covid-19.since
an-april-poll found that 93% of americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal-restrictions.
a-review of 348-articles on non-pharmaceutical-interventions concluded unanimously an-acknowledgement of non-pharmaceutical-interventions importance in controlling the-spread of covid-19.
during the-early-stages of the-pandemic in europe and the-united-states, statistical-modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a-large-number of deaths were used as the-basis for lockdowns.
however, the-swedish-government began considering enacting a-lockdown in early-2021.american-global-health-physicians ranu-dhillon and abraar-karan have argued for "smarter-lockdowns" which use granular-epidemiological-data to only impose restrictions on areas with high-levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable-populations in these-locations to offset the-economic-costs.
centralization of power by political-leadership in hungary, poland, china and cambodia in response to the-pandemic have been cited as examples.
many-women are being forced to ‘lockdown’ at home with many-women abusers at the-same-time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.
for instance, in france there was a-spike in cases of about-30% since the-lockdown in march 2020.
both-the-world-food-programme (wfp) and the-world-health-organization (who) have published statements noting the-impact of the-lockdowns on livelihoods and food-security, and dr-david-nabarro, who special envoy on covid-19 stated in october 2020 that "lockdowns just have one-consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor-people an awful lot poorer".
there have also been a-number of protests over responses to the-covid-19-pandemic worldwide, some of which were specifically in opposition to lockdowns, including in the-united-kingdom, the-united-states, germany, the-netherlands, canada and new-zealand.
some have been spurred by the-economic-and-social-impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the-covid-19-pandemic worldwide, conspiracy-theories and anti-vaccination.
closing of schools and kindergartens closing of non-essential-shops (shops and stores apart from food, doctors and drug-stores)
by 26-march, 1.7-billion-people worldwide were under some-form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9-billion-people by the-first-week of april – more than half of the-world's-population.
restrictions first began in china, with other-countries in east-asia like vietnam soon following china in implementing widespread-containment-measures.
by mid-april, nearly-300-million-people, or about 90 per cent of the-population, were under some-form of lockdown in the-united-states, around 100 million in the-philippines, about 59 million in south-africa, and 1.3 billion were under lockdown in india; the largest of all-lockdowns.
by the-end of april, around-300-million-people were under lockdown in various-countries of europe, including but not limited to italy, spain, france, and the-united-kingdom; while around-200-million-people were under lockdown in latin-america.
the-situation of women in the-world of work ===
a-lot of people have lost a-lot of people jobs or have had a-lot of people-salary and working-hours reduced.
thus, the-number of hours that women dedicate to household-and-care-tasks has considerably increased .
the-pandemic has also led to a-wave of dismissals, more-than-half of which have been made in jobs occupied by women.
these-data show both-the-high-female-presence in this-area and the-fact that the-pandemic has particularly affected women's-role in the-world of work and in their-households.

the-first-confirmed-case in australia was identified on 25-january 2020, in victoria, when a-man who had returned from wuhan, hubei, china, tested positive for the-virus.
the-number of new-cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22-march, and started falling at the-beginning of april to under-20-cases per day by the-end of the-month.
as of 29-april 2021, australia has reported 29,779-cases, 25,486+ recoveries, and 910-deaths, with victoria's-second-wave accounting for nearly-75-percent of cases and 90-percent of fatalities.

this followed a-restriction announced on the-previous-day which affected sixteen-million-people in the-whole-region of lombardy and in fourteen-largely-neighbouring-provinces in emilia-romagna, veneto, piedmont and marche, and prior to that a-smaller-scale-lockdown of ten-municipalities in the-province of lodi and one in the-province of padua that had begun in late-february.
nevertheless, article 16 of the-constitution states that travel-restrictions may be established by law for reasons of health or security.

the-earliest-known-person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1-december 2019, and the-earliest-known-person with symptoms did not have visible-connections with the-later-wet-market-cluster.
of the-early-cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a-link with the-market.
official-case counts refer to the-number of people who have been tested for covid-19 and whose-test has been confirmed positive according to official-protocols.
an-analysis of the-early-phase of the-outbreak up to 23 january estimated 86-percent of covid-19-infections had not been detected, and that these-undocumented-infections were the-source for 79-percent of documented-cases.
on 9-april 2020, preliminary-results found that 15-percent of people tested in gangelt, the-centre of a-major-infection-cluster in germany, tested positive for antibodies.
analysis by age in china indicates that a-relatively-low-proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.
a-retrospective-cohort-study in china found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.
initial-estimates of the-basic-reproduction-number (r0) for covid-19 in january were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a-subsequent-analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a-95-percent-confidence-interval of 3.8 to 8.9).
by mid-may 2020, the-effective-r was close to or below 1.0 in many-countries, meaning the-spread of the-disease in these-areas at that-time was stable or decreasing.
deaths ===
official-deaths from covid-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.
these-counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.
conversely, deaths of people who had underlying-conditions may lead to over-counting.
comparisons of statistics for deaths for all-causes versus the-seasonal-average indicate excess-mortality in many-countries.
this may include deaths due to strained-healthcare-systems and bans on elective-surgery.
the-first-confirmed-death was in wuhan on 9-january 2020.
the-first-confirmed-death occurred on 1-february in the-philippines, and the-first-reported-death outside asia was in the-united-states on 6-february.
people at the-greatest-risk of mortality from covid-19 tend to be those with underlying-conditions, such as those with a-weakened-immune-system, serious-heart-or-lung-problems, severe-obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.
countries like belgium include deaths from suspected-cases of covid-19, regardless of whether the-person was tested, resulting in higher-numbers compared to countries that include only-test-confirmed-cases.
the death-to-case ratio reflects the-number of deaths attributed to covid-19 divided by the-number of diagnosed-cases within a-given-time-interval.
the-number varies by region.
the-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) of the-united-states noted that "because laboratory-test-results are not typically reported on death-certificates in the-u.s., [the-national-center for health-statistics (nchs)] is not planning to implement u07.2 for mortality-statistics" and that-u07.1 would be used "
on 16-april 2020, the-who, in the-who formal publication of the-two-codes, u07.1 and u07.2, "recognized that in many-countries detail as to the-laboratory-confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality-purposes only, to code covid-19 provisionally to code u07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.
it was also noted that the-who "does not distinguish" between infection by sars-cov-2 and covid-19.
a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease is the-infection-fatality-ratio (ifr), which is the-cumulative-number of deaths attributed to the-disease divided by the-cumulative-number of infected-individuals (including asymptomatic-and-undiagnosed-infections) as measured or estimated as of a-specific-date.
in april 2020, an-ifr-range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed-serology-surveys, with the upper bound characterised as much more credible and the-range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).in june 2020, a-peer-reviewed-analysis of pre-serology-data from mainland-china yielded an-overall-ifr of 0.66% (with age-bracketed-values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9-years to 0.595% for 50–59-years to 7.8% for > 80 years).in july 2020, the-us-cdc adopted the-ifr as a-"more-directly-measurable-parameter for disease-severity for covid-19" and computed an-overall-'best-estimate' for planning-purposes for the-u.s. of 0.65%.
in august 2020, the-who reported serology-testing for three-locations in europe (with some-data through 2-june)
cebm-researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record "ct-lung-findings and associated-blood-tests" and for the-who to produce a-"protocol to standardise the-use and interpretation of pcr" with continuous-re-calibration.
in september, the-cdc computed an-age-bracketed-'best-estimate' for the-u.s. of 0.003% for 0–19-years; 0.02% for 20–49-years; 0.5% for 50–69-years; and 5.4% for 70+-years.
in september 2020, a-bulletin of the-world-health-organization-article by john-ioannidis estimated the-median-global-ifr inferred from seroprevalence-data at 0.23% overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low-mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high-mortality) and 0.05% for people <-70-years (a-range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the-pandemic.
these-researchers noted a-decrease in ifr in england over time; and, for the-uk and italy (the-two-european-nations worst hit by covid-19), attribute the-rise in daily-cases, stability in daily-deaths, and shift of cases to a-younger-population to waning-viral-circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test-results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus-mutation.
in november 2020, a-review-article in nature reported estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities, and found a-median-range of 0.24% to 1.49%.in december 2020, a-systematic-review and meta-analysis published in the-european-journal of epidemiology estimated that population-weighted-ifr was 0.5% to 1% in some-countries (france, netherlands, new-zealand, and portugal), 1%-to-2% in several-other-countries (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and about 2.5% in italy; estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities included fatalities in elderly-care-facilities.
another-metric in assessing death-rate is the-case-fatality-ratio (cfr), which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.
another-metric in assessing death-rate can be misleading because of the-delay between symptom-onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more-severe-symptoms).
on 4-august, who indicated "at this-early-stage of the-pandemic, most-estimates of fatality-ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude-methods, giving rise to widely-variable-estimates of cfr by country – from less-than-0.1% to over-25%."

vaccines ===
the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 6 january 2021 and the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 29-january 2021.
on 4-february 2020, us secretary of health and human-services alex azar published a-notice of declaration under the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act for medical-countermeasures against covid-19, covering "any-vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid-19, or the-transmission of sars-cov-2 or a-virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the-declaration precludes "liability-claims alleging negligence by a-manufacturer in creating a-vaccine, or negligence by a-health-care-provider in prescribing the-wrong-dose,-absent-willful-misconduct".
the-declaration is effective in the-united-states through 1-october 2024.
there is no-specific,-effective-treatment or cure for coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), the-disease caused by the-sars-cov-2-virus.
in these, supportive-care includes medication such as paracetamol or nsaids to relieve symptoms (fever, body-aches, cough), proper-intake of fluids, rest, and nasal-breathing.
the-u.s.-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the-virus isolate those who suspect they are carrying the-virus at home and wear a-face-mask.
people with more-severe-cases may need treatment in hospital.
nevertheless, in the-united-states, two-monoclonal-antibody-based-therapies are available for early-use in cases thought to be at high-risk of progression to severe-disease.
the-antiviral-remdesivir is available in the-u.s., canada, australia, and several-other-countries, with varying-restrictions; however, the-antiviral-remdesivir is not recommended for people needing mechanical-ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the-world-health-organization (who), due to limited-evidence of the-antiviral-remdesivir efficacy.
for mitigation to be effective, (a)-chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health-care must be available to provide for the-needs of those-infected,-and-(c)-contingencies must be in place to allow for effective-rollout of (a) and (b).
containment is undertaken in the-early-stages of an-outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other-measures to stop the-disease from spreading.
when it is no longer possible to contain the-disease, efforts then move to the-mitigation-stage: measures are taken to slow the-spread and mitigate the-spread effects on the-healthcare-system and society.
suppression requires more-extreme-measures so as to reverse the-pandemic by reducing the-basic-reproduction-number to less than 1.part of managing an-infectious-disease-outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the-epidemic-peak, known as flattening the-epidemic-curve.
this decreases the-risk of health-services being overwhelmed and provides more-time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
more-drastic-actions aimed at containing the-outbreak were taken in china once the-severity of the-outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire-cities and imposing strict-travel-bans.
other-countries also adopted a-variety of measures aimed at limiting the-spread of the-virus.
singapore provided financial-support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large-fines for those who failed to do so.
simulations for great-britain and the-united-states show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic-growth) have major-challenges.
optimal-mitigation-policies might reduce peak-healthcare-demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds-of-thousands of deaths and overwhelmed-health-systems.
suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the-virus is circulating in the-human-population (or until a-vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
long-term-intervention to suppress the-pandemic has considerable-social-and-economic-costs.

increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the-needs of covid-19-patients is described by the-who as a-fundamental-outbreak-response-measure.
the-ecdc and the-european-regional-office of the who have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary-healthcare-services for shifting of resources at multiple-levels, including focusing laboratory-services towards covid-19 testing, cancelling elective-procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating covid-19-positive-patients, and increasing intensive-care-capabilities by training personnel and increasing the-number of available-ventilators and beds.
= based on the-retrospective-analysis, starting from december 2019, the-number of covid-19-cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 december and at least 266 by 31 december.
the following day, on december 31, the-who learned about a-cluster of viral-pneumonia-cases of an-unknown-cause in wuhan.
an-investigation was launched at the-start of january 2020.according to official-chinese-sources, the-early-cases were mostly linked to the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market, which also sold live-animals.
in march 2021, the-who published their-report on the-potential-zoonotic-source of the-virus.
the-who concluded that human-spillover via an-intermediate-animal-host was the-most-likely-explanation, with direct-spillover from bats next most likely and introduction through the-food-supply-chain as another-possible-explanation.
during the-early-stages of the-outbreak, the-number of cases doubled approximately-every-seven-and-a-half-days.
in early and mid-january 2020, the-virus spread to other-chinese-provinces, helped by the-chinese-new-year-migration and wuhan being a-transport-hub and major-rail-interchange.
on 20-january, china reported nearly-140-new-cases in one-day, including two-people in beijing and one in shenzhen.
a-retrospective-official-study published in march found that 6,174-people had already developed symptoms by 20-january (most of 6,174-people would be diagnosed later) and more may have been infected.
a-report in the-lancet on 24-january indicated human-transmission, strongly-recommended-personal-protective-equipment for health-workers, and said testing for the-virus was essential due to the-virus "pandemic-potential".

at least twelve sitting or former-iranian-politicians and government-officials had died from the-outbreak began by 17-march 2020.
after reaching a-low in new-cases in early-may, a-new-peak was reported on 4-june 2020, raising fear of a-second-wave.
the-nation's-health-agency reported a-significant-increase in confirmed-cases on 20-february, largely attributed to a-gathering in daegu of the-shincheonji-church of jesus.
shincheonji-devotees visiting daegu from wuhan were suspected to be the-origin of the-outbreak.
south-korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the-world to screen the-population for the-virus, isolate any-infected-people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted any-infected-people.
screening-methods included mandatory-self-reporting of symptoms by new-international-arrivals through mobile-application, drive-through-testing for the-virus with the-results available the next day, and increasing-testing-capability to allow up-to-20,000-people to be tested every day.
despite some-early-criticisms of president-moon-jae-in's-response to the-crisis, south-korea-programme is considered a success in controlling the-outbreak without quarantining entire-cities.
on 29-march, it was reported that beginning 1 april all-new-overseas-arrivals will be quarantined for two-weeks.
persistent-local-groups of infections in the-greater-seoul-area continued to be found, which led to south-korea's-cdc-director saying in june that south-korea had entered the-second-wave of infections, although a-who-official disagreed with that-assessment.
although it was originally thought the-pandemic reached france on 24-january 2020, when the-first-covid-19-case in europe was confirmed in bordeaux, the-first-covid-19-case in europe was later discovered that a-person near paris had tested positive for the-covid-19-virus on 27-december 2019 after retesting old-samples.
a-key-event in the-spread of the-disease in the-country was the-annual-assembly of the-christian-open-door-church between 17 and 24 february in mulhouse, which was attended by about-2,500-people, at-least-half of whom are believed to have contracted the-virus.
on 18-may, it was reported that schools in france had to close again after reopening, due to covid-19-case-flare-ups.
on 12-november, it was reported that france had become the-worst-hit-country by the-covid-19-pandemic, in all of europe, in the-process surpassing russia.
the-new-total of confirmed-cases was more than 1.8 million and counting; additionally the-new-total of confirmed-cases was indicated by russia that the-current-national-lockdown would remain in place.
italy ====
italy === was confirmed to have spread to italy ===
cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the-italian-government to suspend all-flights to and from china and declare a-state of emergency.
an-unassociated-cluster of covid-19-cases was later detected, starting with 16-confirmed-cases in lombardy on 21-february 2020.
"on 4-march 2020 , the-italian-government ordered the-full-closure of all-schools and universities nationwide as italy reached a-hundred-deaths.
on 19-march 2020, italy overtook china as the-country with the-most-covid-19-related-deaths in the-world after reporting 3,405-fatalities from the-pandemic.
a-cnn-report indicated that the-combination of italy's-large-elderly-population and inability to test all who have the-virus to date may be contributing to the-high-fatality-rate.
on 19-april 2020, the-combination of italy's-large-elderly-population and inability to test all who have the-virus to date may be contributing to the-high-fatality-rate was reported that russia had russia lowest-deaths at 433 in seven-days and some-businesses were asking for a-loosening of restrictions after six-weeks of lockdown.
on 11-november, it was reported that silvestro-scotti, president of the-italian-federation of general-practitioners indicated that all of italy should come under restrictions due to the-spread of covid-19.
on the-10th, a day before, italy surpassed 1 million confirmed-covid-19-cases.
on 23-november, it was reported that the-second-wave of the-pandemic has caused some-hospitals in italy to stop accepting patients.
the-swedish-strategy focused on measures that could be put in place over a-longer-period of time, based on the-assumption that the-virus would start spreading again after a-shorter-lockdown.
the-new-york-times said that, as of may 2020, the-outbreak had been far deadlier there but the-economic-impact had been reduced as swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.
on 19-may, the-new-york-times was reported that the-country had in the-week of 12–19-may the highest per capita deaths in europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.
in the-end of june, sweden no longer had excess-mortality.
devolution in the-united-kingdom meant that each of the-four-countries of the-uk had the-uk own different-response to covid-19, and the-uk government, on behalf of england, moved quicker to lift restrictions.
the-uk-government started enforcing social-distancing-and-quarantine-measures on 18-march 2020 and was criticised for a-perceived-lack of intensity in the-uk-government response to concerns faced by the-public.
on 16-march, prime-minister-boris-johnson advised against non-essential-travel and social-contact, suggesting people work from home and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
on 20-march, the-government ordered all-leisure-establishments to close as soon as possible, and promised to prevent unemployment.
on 24-april, most-non-essential-businesses was reported that a-promising-vaccine-trial had begun in england; the-government pledged more than £50 million towards research.
on 16-april, the-first-operating was reported that the-uk would have first-access to the-oxford-vaccine, due to a-prior-contract; should the-trial be successful, some-30-million-doses in the-uk would be available.
on 2-december, the-uk became the-first-western-country to approve the-pfizer-vaccine against the-covid-19-virus; 800,000-doses would be immediately available for use.
it was reported on 5-december that the-united-kingdom would begin vaccination against the-virus on 8-december, less than a week after having been approved.
on 20-may, it was reported that brazil had a-record-1,179-deaths in a-single-day, for a-total of almost-18,000-fatalities.
with a-total-number of almost-272,000-cases, brazil became brazil with the-third-highest-number of cases, following russia and the-united-states.
on 25-may, brazil exceeded the-number of reported-cases in russia when reported-cases in russia reported that 11,687-new-cases had been confirmed over the-previous-24-hours, bringing the-total-number to over 374,800, with more-than-23,400-deaths.
