202	self-concept	1	is	1	the-whole-sum	1	of	1	beliefs	1	that	1	people	1	have	1	about	1	people.	1
203	beliefs	1	that	2	people	2	have	1	about	1	and	1	guide	1	the-processing	1	of	1	self-referential-information.	1
204	for	1	example,	1	an-athlete	1	at	1	a-university	1	would	4	have	1	multiple-selves	1	that	1	process	2	different-information	1	pertinent	2	to	2	each-self:	1	the-student	1	be	1	oneself,	1	who	1	information	1	a-student	1	(taking	1	notes	1	in	1	class,	1	completing	1	a-homework-assignment,	1	etc.);	1

213	leon-festinger's-1954-social-comparison-theory	1	is	1	that	1	people	5	evaluate	1	own	2	abilities	1	and	1	opinions	1	by	1	comparing	1	to	1	others	1	when	1	are	1	uncertain	1	of	1	ability	1	or	1	opinions.	1
214	daryl-bem's-1972-self-perception-theory	1	claims	1	that	1	when	1	internal-cues	1	are	1	difficult	1	to	1	interpret,	1	people	2	gain	1	self-insight	1	by	1	observing	1	own	1	behavior.	1
215	people	2	develop	1	self-concepts	1	by	1	various-means,	1	including	1	introspection,	1	feedback	1	from	1	others,	1	self-perception,	1	and	1	social-comparison.	1
216	by	1	comparing	1	themselves	1	to	2	others,	1	people	2	gain	1	information	1	about	1	people,	1	and	1	make	1	inferences	1	that	1	are	1	relevant	1	self-esteem.	1
217	social-comparisons	1	can	1	be	1	either	2	upward	1	or	3	downward,	1	that-is,-comparisons	1	to	1	people	1	who	1	are	1	higher	1	lower	1	in	1	status	1	ability.	1
218	downward-comparisons	1	are	1	often	1	made	1	in	1	order	1	to	1	elevate	1	self-esteem.	1
219	social-influence	1	is	1	an-overarching-term	1	that	1	denotes	1	the-persuasive-effects	1	people	1	have	1	on	1	each	1	other.	1

221	similarly,	1	people	2	may	1	expect	1	hostility	2	in	2	others	2	and	1	induce	1	by	1	own-behavior.	1
222	specifically,	1	social-influence	1	refers	1	to	2	the-way	1	in	1	which	1	individuals	2	change	1	ideas	1	and	1	actions	1	meet	1	the-demands	1	of	1	a-social-group,	1	received	1	authority,	1	social-role,	1	or	1	a-minority	1	within	1	a-group	1	wielding	1	influence	1	over	1	the-majority.	1

225	these-perceptions	1	and	1	behaviors	1	in	1	turn	1	define	1	the-social-identity	1	of	1	individuals	1	within	1	the-interacting-groups.	1
226	for	1	example,	1	group-polarization,	1	formerly	1	known	1	as	1	the-"risky-shift",	1	occurs	1	when	1	people	2	polarize	1	views	1	in	1	a-more-extreme-direction	1	after	1	group-discussion.	1
227	in	2	contrast,	1	social-loafing	1	is	1	the-tendency	1	of	1	individuals	1	to	1	slack	1	off	1	when	1	working	1	a-group.	1
228	a-major-area	1	of	2	study	1	people's-relations	1	to	3	each	2	other	1	is	1	interpersonal-attraction,	1	which	1	refers	1	all-forces	1	that	1	lead	1	people	1	like	1	other,	1	establish	1	relationships,	1	and	1	(in	1	some-cases)	1	fall	1	in	1	love.	1
229	for	1	example,	1	one	1	could	1	correlate	1	the-number	2	of	2	violent-television	1	shows	1	children	1	watch	1	at	2	home	1	with	1	violent-incidents	1	the-children	1	participate	1	in	1	school.	1

231	whenever	1	possible,	1	social-psychologists	1	rely	1	on	2	controlled-experimentation,	1	which	1	requires	1	the-manipulation	1	of	1	one-or-more-independent-variables	1	in	1	order	1	to	1	examine	1	the-effect	1	a-dependent-variable.	1

800	when	1	people	2	are	2	asked	1	whether	1	there	1	more-english-words	1	with	2	k	2	in	2	the-first-position	1	or	1	the-third-position,	1	use	1	the-same-process.	1
801	this	1	leads	1	people	1	to	1	the-incorrect-conclusion	1	that	1	k	1	is	1	more	1	common	1	at	1	the-start	1	of	1	words.	1
802	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman	1	offered	1	the-availability-heuristic	1	as	1	an-explanation	1	for	1	illusory-correlations	1	in	1	which	1	people	1	wrongly	1	judge	1	two-events	1	to	1	be	1	associated	1	with	1	each	1	other.	1
803	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman	1	explained	1	that	1	people	1	judge	1	correlation	1	on	1	the-basis	1	of	2	the-ease	1	imagining	1	or	1	recalling	1	the-two-events	1	together.	1
804	the-representativeness-heuristic	1	is	2	seen	1	when	2	people	1	use	1	categories,	1	for	1	example	1	deciding	1	whether	1	or	1	not	1	a-person	1	a-criminal.	1
805	when	1	people	2	categorise	1	things	1	on	1	the-basis	1	of	1	representativeness,	1	are	1	using	1	the	1	representativeness	1	heuristic.	1
806	thus,	1	people	1	can	1	overestimate	1	the-likelihood	2	that	1	something	1	has	1	a-very-rare-property,	1	or	1	underestimate	1	of	1	a-very-common-property.	1
807	the-representativeness-heuristic	1	is	1	also	2	an-explanation	1	of	2	how	1	people	3	judge	1	cause	1	and	1	effect:	1	when	1	make	1	these-judgements	1	on	1	the-basis	1	similarity,	1	are	1	said	1	to	1	be	1	using	1	the	1	representativeness	1	heuristic.	1
808	this	1	can	1	lead	1	to	1	a-bias,	1	incorrectly	1	finding	1	causal-relationships	1	between	1	things	1	that	1	resemble	1	one	1	another	1	and	2	missing	1	people	1	when	1	the-cause	1	effect	1	are	1	very	1	different.	1
809	if	1	people	2	based	1	people-judgments	1	on	1	probability,	1	would	1	say	1	that	1	tom	1	is	2	more	2	likely	1	to	1	study	1	humanities	2	than	1	library-science,	1	because	1	there	1	are	1	many	1	students,	1	and	2	the-additional-information	1	in	1	the-profile	1	vague	1	unreliable.	1
810	when	1	people	2	rely	1	on	1	representativeness,	1	can	1	fall	1	into	1	an-error	1	which	1	breaks	1	a-fundamental-law	1	of	1	probability.	1
811	people	1	reading	1	this-description	1	then	1	ranked	1	the-likelihood	1	of	1	different-statements	1	about	1	a-woman	1	called	1	linda.	1
812	people	1	showed	1	a-strong-tendency	1	to	1	rate	1	the	1	latter,-more-specific-statement	1	as	1	more	2	likely,	1	even	1	though	1	a-conjunction	1	of	1	the-form	1	"linda	1	is	1	both-x	1	and	1	y"	1	can	1	never	1	be	1	probable	1	than	1	the-more-general-statement	1
813	the-explanation	1	in	2	terms	1	of	4	heuristics	1	is	1	that	1	the-judgment	1	was	2	distorted	1	because,	1	for	1	the-readers,	1	the-character-sketch	1	representative	1	the-sort	1	person	1	who	2	might	1	be	1	an-active-feminist	1	but	1	not	1	someone	1	works	1	a-bank.	1
814	a-great-majority	1	of	1	people	1	reading	1	this-character-sketch	1	rated	1	"bill	2	is	1	an-accountant	1	who	1	plays	2	jazz	2	for	2	a-hobby",	1	as	1	more	1	likely	1	than	1	a-hobby".	1
815	other-researchers	1	also	1	carried	1	out	1	variations	1	of	1	this-study,	1	exploring	1	the-possibility	1	that	1	people	1	had	1	misunderstood	1	the-question.	1
816	it	1	has	1	been	1	shown	1	that	1	individuals	1	with	1	high-crt-scores	1	are	1	significantly	1	less	1	likely	1	to	2	be	1	subject	1	the-conjunction-fallacy.	1
817	people's-answers	1	to	2	the-problem	1	typically	1	reply	1	that	1	the-number	1	of	2	births	1	in	2	the-hospital	1	makes	1	no-difference	1	the-likelihood	1	more-than-60%-male-babies	1	one-day.	1
818	the-explanation	1	in	1	terms	1	of	4	the-heuristic	1	is	2	that	1	people	1	consider	1	only	1	how	1	representative	1	the-figure	1	60%	1	the-previously-given-average	1	50%.	1
819	this	1	means	1	unrelated-and-non-diagnostic-information	1	about	1	certain-issue	2	can	1	make	1	relative-information	1	less	1	powerful	1	to	1	when	1	people	1	understand	1	the-phenomenon.	1
820	representativeness	1	explains	1	systematic-errors	1	that	1	people	1	make	1	when	1	judging	1	the-probability	1	of	1	random-events.	1
821	for	1	example,	1	in	1	a-sequence	1	of	2	coin-tosses,	1	each	1	which	1	comes	1	up	1	heads	1	(h)	1	or	1	tails	1	(t),	1	people	1	reliably	1	tend	1	to	1	judge	1	a-clearly-patterned-sequence	1	such	2	as	3	hhhttt	1	less	1	likely	1	than	1	a-less-patterned-sequence	1	hthtth.	1
822	these-sequences	1	have	1	exactly-the-same-probability,	1	but	1	people	1	tend	1	to	2	see	1	the-more-clearly-patterned-sequences	1	as	1	less-representative	1	of	1	randomness,	1	and	1	so	1	less	1	likely	1	result	1	from	1	a-random-process.	1
823	anchoring	1	and	1	adjustment	1	is	1	a-heuristic	1	used	1	in	1	many-situations	1	where	1	people	1	estimate	1	a-number.	1
824	in	1	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman's-experiments,	1	people	1	did	1	not	1	shift	1	far	1	enough	1	away	1	from	1	the-anchor.	1
825	an-alternative-theory	1	is	2	that	1	people	2	form	1	estimates	1	on	1	evidence	1	which	1	selectively	1	brought	1	to	1	mind	1	by	1	an-anchor.	1
826	the-effect	1	is	1	stronger	1	when	1	people	2	have	1	to	1	make	1	judgments	1	quickly.	1
827	an-example	1	is	1	where	1	people	2	predict	1	the-value	1	of	1	a-stock-market-index	1	on	1	a-particular-day	1	by	1	defining	1	an	1	upper	1	and	1	lower	1	bound	1	so	1	that	1	are	1	98%	1	confident	1	the-true-value	1	will	1	fall	1	in	1	that-range.	1
828	a-reliable-finding	1	is	1	that	1	people	3	anchor	1	upper-and-lower-bounds	1	too	1	close	1	to	1
829	one-much-replicated-finding	1	is	2	that	2	when	1	people	2	are	2	98%	1	certain	1	a-number	1	in	1	a-particular-range,	1	wrong	1	about	1	thirty	1	to	1	forty	1	percent	1	of	1	the-time.	1
830	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman	1	demonstrated	1	this	1	by	1	asking	1	a-group	1	of	1	people	1	to	1	rapidly	1	estimate	1	the-product	1	8	1	x	7	7	1	6	1	5	1	4	1	3	1	2	1	1.	1
831	the-explanation	1	in	1	terms	1	of	2	anchoring	1	is	1	that	1	people	1	multiply	1	the-first-few-terms	1	each-product	1	and	1	anchor	1	on	1	that-figure.	1
832	a-common-finding	1	from	1	studies	1	of	1	these-tasks	1	is	1	that	1	people	1	anchor	1	on	1	the-small-component-probabilities	1	and	1	so	1	underestimate	1	the-total.	1
833	a-corresponding-effect	1	happens	1	when	1	people	1	estimate	1	the-probability	1	of	1	multiple-events	1	happening	1	in	2	sequence,	1	such	1	as	1	an-accumulator-bet	1	horse-racing.	1
834	in	1	one-experiment,	1	people	2	wrote	1	down	1	the-last-two-digits	1	of	1	social-security-numbers.	1
835	people	3	were	1	then	1	asked	1	to	1	consider	1	whether	1	would	1	pay	1	this-number	1	of	1	dollars	1	for	1	items	1	whose-value	1	did	1	not	1	know,	1	such	1	as	1	wine,	1	chocolate,	1	and	1	computer-equipment.	1
836	people	1	then	1	entered	1	an-auction	1	to	1	bid	1	for	2	they	2	would	1	pay	1	this-number	1	of	1	dollars	1	items	1	whose-value	1	did	1	not	1	know,	1	such	1	as	1	wine,	1	chocolate,	1	and	1	computer-equipment.	1
837	in	1	one-review,	1	researchers	1	found	1	that	2	if	1	a-stimulus	2	is	1	perceived	1	to	3	be	1	important	1	or	1	carry	1	"weight"	1	a-situation,	1	people	1	were	1	more	1	likely	1	attribute	1	as	1	heavier	1	physically.	1
838	when	1	people	2	use	1	affect	2	("gut	1	responses")	1	to	1	judge	1	benefits	1	or	1	risks,	1	are	1	using	1	the	1	heuristic.	1
839	there	1	are	1	competing-theories	1	of	2	human-judgment,	1	which	1	differ	1	on	1	whether	1	the-use	1	heuristics	1	is	1	irrational.	1
840	a-cognitive-laziness-approach	1	argues	1	that	1	heuristics	1	are	1	inevitable-shortcuts	1	given	1	the-limitations	1	of	1	the-human-brain.	1
841	this	2	has	1	led	1	to	1	a-theory	1	called	1	"attribute	1	substitution",	1	which	1	says	1	that	2	people	2	often	1	handle	1	a-complicated-question	1	by	1	answering	1	a-different,-related-question,	1	without	1	being	1	aware	1	is	1	what	1	are	1	doing.	1
842	a-third-approach	1	argues	1	that	1	heuristics	1	perform	1	just	1	as	2	well	1	more-complicated-decision-making-procedures,	1	but	1	more	1	quickly	1	and	1	with	1	less-information.	1
843	an-effort-reduction-framework	1	proposed	1	by	1	anuj-k.-shah	1	and	1	daniel-m.-oppenheimer	1	states	1	that	1	people	1	use	1	a-variety	1	of	2	techniques	1	to	1	reduce	1	the-effort	1	making	1	decisions.	1
844	this	1	explains	1	why	2	individuals	2	can	1	be	1	unaware	1	of	2	own	1	biases,	1	and	1	biases	1	persist	1	even	1	when	1	the-subject	1	is	1	made	1	aware	1	individuals.	1
845	hence,	1	when	1	someone	1	tries	1	to	1	answer	2	a-difficult-question,	1	individuals	1	may	1	actually	1	a-related-but-different-question,	1	without	1	realizing	1	that	1	a-substitution	1	has	1	taken	1	place.	1
846	substitution	1	is	2	not	1	expected	1	to	1	take	1	place	1	in	1	answering	1	factual-questions	1	that	1	can	1	be	1	retrieved	1	directly	1	from	1	memory	1	("what	1	your-birthday?")	1
847	for	1	example,	1	someone	1	who	1	has	1	been	1	thinking	1	about	1	example	2	love-life	2	and	1	is	1	then	1	asked	1	how-happy-example	2	are	2	might	1	substitute	1	with	1	rather	1	than	1	other-areas.	1
848	gerd-gigerenzer	1	and	1	colleagues	1	have	1	argued	1	that	2	heuristics	1	can	1	be	1	used	1	to	1	make	1	judgments	1	are	1	accurate	1	rather	1	than	1	biased.	1
849	according	1	to	2	gerd-gigerenzer	1	and	1	colleagues,	1	heuristics	1	are	2	"fast-and-frugal"-alternatives	1	more-complicated-procedures,	1	giving	1	answers	1	that	1	just	1	as	1	good.	1
850	warren-thorngate,	1	a-social-psychologist,	1	implemented	1	ten-simple-decision-rules	1	or	1	heuristics	1	in	1	a-computer-program.	1
851	legal-scholar-cass-sunstein	1	has	1	argued	1	that	1	attribute-substitution	1	is	1	pervasive	1	when	1	people	1	reason	1	about	1	moral,-political-or-legal-matters.	1
852	given	1	a-difficult,-novel-problem	1	in	1	these-areas,	1	people	1	search	1	for	1	a-more-familiar,-related-problem	1	(a-"prototypical-case")	1	and	1	apply	1	its-solution	1	as	1	the-solution	1	to	1	the-harder-problem.	1
853	according	1	to	1	legal-scholar-cass-sunstein,	1	the-opinions	1	of	1	trusted-political-or-religious-authorities	1	can	1	serve	1	as	1	heuristic-attributes	1	when	1	people	2	are	1	asked	1	own	1	opinions	1	on	1	a-matter.	1
854	this	1	explains	1	how	1	there	1	are	2	often	1	two-ways	1	we	1	able	1	to	1	process	1	information	1	from	1	persuasive-messages,	1	one	1	being	1	heuristically	1	and	1	the	1	other	1	systematically.	1

1681	heuristics	1	that	1	underlie	1	judgment	1	are	1	called	1	"judgment	1	heuristics".	1
1682	when	1	people	2	estimate	1	how	2	likely	1	or	1	frequent	1	an-event	2	is	1	on	1	the-basis	1	of	1	availability,	1	are	1	using	1	the-availability-heuristic.	1
1683	for	1	example,	1	people	2	overestimate	1	likelihood	1	of	1	dying	1	in	1	a-dramatic-event	1	such	1	as	1	a-tornado	1	or	1	terrorism.	1
1684	this-heuristic	1	is	1	one	1	of	2	the-reasons	1	why	1	people	1	are	1	more	1	easily	1	swayed	1	by	2	a-single,-vivid-story	1	than	1	a-large-body	1	statistical-evidence.	1
1685	this-heuristic	1	may	1	also	1	play	1	a-role	1	in	1	the-appeal	1	of	2	lotteries:	1	to	1	someone	1	buying	1	a-ticket,	1	the-well-publicised,-jubilant-winners	1	are	1	more	1	available	1	than	1	the-millions	1	people	1	who	1	have	1	won	1	nothing.	1
1686	when	1	people	1	judge	1	whether	1	more-english-words	1	begin	1	with	2	t	1	or	1	k	1	,	1	the-availability-heuristic	1	gives	1	a-quick-way	1	to	1	answer	1	the-question.	1

1689	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman	1	offered	1	the-availability-heuristic	1	as	1	an-explanation	1	for	1	illusory-correlations	1	in	1	which	1	people	1	wrongly	1	judge	1	two-events	1	to	1	be	1	associated	1	with	1	each	1	other.	1
1690	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman	1	explained	1	that	1	people	1	judge	1	correlation	1	on	1	the-basis	1	of	2	the-ease	1	imagining	1	or	1	recalling	1	the-two-events	1	together.	1
1691	the-representativeness-heuristic	1	is	2	seen	1	when	2	people	1	use	1	categories,	1	for	1	example	1	deciding	1	whether	1	or	1	not	1	a-person	1	a-criminal.	1
1692	when	1	people	2	categorise	1	things	1	on	1	the-basis	1	of	1	representativeness,	1	are	1	using	1	the	1	representativeness	1	heuristic.	1
1693	thus,	1	people	1	can	1	overestimate	1	the-likelihood	2	that	1	something	1	has	1	a-very-rare-property,	1	or	1	underestimate	1	of	1	a-very-common-property.	1
1694	the-representativeness-heuristic	1	is	1	also	2	an-explanation	1	of	2	how	1	people	3	judge	1	cause	1	and	1	effect:	1	when	1	make	1	these-judgements	1	on	1	the-basis	1	similarity,	1	are	1	said	1	to	1	be	1	using	1	the	1	representativeness	1	heuristic.	1
1695	if	1	people	2	based	1	people-judgments	1	on	1	probability,	1	would	1	say	1	that	1	tom	1	is	2	more	2	likely	1	to	1	study	1	humanities	2	than	1	library-science,	1	because	1	there	1	are	1	many	1	students,	1	and	2	the-additional-information	1	in	1	the-profile	1	vague	1	unreliable.	1
1696	when	1	people	2	rely	1	on	1	representativeness,	1	can	1	fall	1	into	1	an-error	1	which	1	breaks	1	a-fundamental-law	1	of	1	probability.	1
1697	people	1	reading	1	this-description	1	then	1	ranked	1	the-likelihood	1	of	1	different-statements	1	about	1	she.	1
1698	people	1	showed	1	a-strong-tendency	1	to	1	rate	1	the	1	latter,-more-specific-statement	1	as	1	more	2	likely,	1	even	1	though	1	a-conjunction	1	of	1	the-form	1	"she	1	is	1	both-x	1	and	1	y"	1	can	1	never	1	be	1	probable	1	than	1	the-more-general-statement	1
1699	the-explanation	1	in	2	terms	1	of	4	heuristics	1	is	1	that	1	the-judgment	1	was	2	distorted	1	because,	1	for	1	the-readers,	1	the-character-sketch	1	representative	1	the-sort	1	person	1	who	2	might	1	be	1	an-active-feminist	1	but	1	not	1	someone	1	works	1	a-bank.	1
1700	a-great-majority	1	of	1	people	1	reading	1	this-character-sketch	1	rated	1	"bill	2	is	1	an-accountant	1	who	1	plays	2	jazz	2	for	2	a-hobby",	1	as	1	more	1	likely	1	than	1	a-hobby".	1
1701	other-researchers	1	also	1	carried	1	out	1	variations	1	of	1	this-study,	1	exploring	1	the-possibility	1	that	1	people	1	had	1	misunderstood	1	the-question.	1
1702	it	1	has	1	been	1	shown	1	that	1	individuals	1	with	1	high-crt-scores	1	are	1	significantly	1	less	1	likely	1	to	2	be	1	subject	1	the-conjunction-fallacy.	1
1703	they	1	typically	1	reply	1	that	1	the-number	1	of	2	births	1	in	2	the-hospital	1	makes	1	no-difference	1	to	1	the-likelihood	1	more-than-60%-male-babies	1	one-day.	1
1704	the-explanation	1	in	1	terms	1	of	4	the-heuristic	1	is	2	that	1	people	1	consider	1	only	1	how	1	representative	1	the-figure	1	60%	1	the-previously-given-average	1	50%.	1
1705	this	1	means	1	unrelated-and-non-diagnostic-information	1	about	1	certain-issue	2	can	1	make	1	relative-information	1	less	1	powerful	1	to	1	when	1	people	1	understand	1	the-phenomenon.	1
1706	representativeness	1	explains	1	systematic-errors	1	that	1	people	1	make	1	when	1	judging	1	the-probability	1	of	1	random-events.	1
1707	for	1	example,	1	in	1	a-sequence	1	of	2	coin-tosses,	1	each	1	which	1	comes	1	up	1	heads	1	(h)	1	or	1	tails	1	(t),	1	people	1	reliably	1	tend	1	to	1	judge	1	a-clearly-patterned-sequence	1	such	2	as	3	hhhttt	1	less	1	likely	1	than	1	a-less-patterned-sequence	1	hthtth.	1
1708	these-sequences	1	have	1	exactly-the-same-probability,	1	but	1	people	1	tend	1	to	2	see	1	the-more-clearly-patterned-sequences	1	as	1	less-representative	1	of	1	randomness,	1	and	1	so	1	less	1	likely	1	result	1	from	1	a-random-process.	1
1709	anchoring	1	and	1	adjustment	1	is	1	a-heuristic	1	used	1	in	1	many-situations	1	where	1	people	1	estimate	1	a-number.	1
1710	in	1	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman's-experiments,	1	people	1	did	1	not	1	shift	1	far	1	enough	1	away	1	from	1	the-anchor.	1
1711	an-alternative-theory	1	is	2	that	1	people	2	form	1	estimates	1	on	1	evidence	1	which	1	selectively	1	brought	1	to	1	mind	1	by	1	an-anchor.	1
1712	the-anchoring-effect	1	is	1	stronger	1	when	1	people	2	have	1	to	1	make	1	judgments	1	quickly.	1
1713	an-example	1	is	1	where	1	people	2	predict	1	the-value	1	of	1	a-stock-market-index	1	on	1	a-particular-day	1	by	1	defining	1	an	1	upper	1	and	1	lower	1	bound	1	so	1	that	1	are	1	98%	1	confident	1	the-true-value	1	will	1	fall	1	in	1	that-range.	1
1714	a-reliable-finding	1	is	1	that	1	people	3	anchor	1	upper-and-lower-bounds	1	too	1	close	1	to	1
1715	one-much-replicated-finding	1	is	2	that	2	when	1	people	2	are	2	98%	1	certain	1	a-number	1	in	1	a-particular-range,	1	wrong	1	about	1	thirty	1	to	1	forty	1	percent	1	of	1	the-time.	1
1716	tversky	1	and	1	kahneman	1	demonstrated	1	this	1	by	1	asking	1	a-group	1	of	1	people	1	to	1	rapidly	1	estimate	1	the-product	1	8	1	x	7	7	1	6	1	5	1	4	1	3	1	2	1	1.	1
1717	the-explanation	1	in	1	terms	1	of	2	anchoring	1	is	1	that	1	people	1	multiply	1	the-first-few-terms	1	each-product	1	and	1	anchor	1	on	1	that-figure.	1
1718	a-common-finding	1	from	1	studies	1	of	1	these-tasks	1	is	1	that	1	people	1	anchor	1	on	1	the-small-component-probabilities	1	and	1	so	1	underestimate	1	the-total.	1
1719	a-corresponding-effect	1	happens	1	when	1	people	1	estimate	1	the-probability	1	of	1	multiple-events	1	happening	1	in	2	sequence,	1	such	1	as	1	an-accumulator-bet	1	horse-racing.	1
1720	in	1	one-experiment,	1	people	2	wrote	1	down	1	the-last-two-digits	1	of	1	social-security-numbers.	1
1721	people	3	were	1	then	1	asked	1	to	1	consider	1	whether	1	would	1	pay	1	this-number	1	of	1	dollars	1	for	1	items	1	whose-value	1	did	1	not	1	know,	1	such	1	as	1	wine,	1	chocolate,	1	and	1	computer-equipment.	1
1722	in	1	one-review,	1	researchers	1	found	1	that	2	if	1	a-stimulus	2	is	1	perceived	1	to	3	be	1	important	1	or	1	carry	1	"weight"	1	a-situation,	1	people	1	were	1	more	1	likely	1	attribute	1	as	1	heavier	1	physically.	1
1723	when	1	people	2	use	1	affect	2	("gut	1	responses")	1	to	1	judge	1	benefits	1	or	1	risks,	1	are	1	using	1	the	1	heuristic.	1
1724	there	1	are	1	competing-theories	1	of	2	human-judgment,	1	which	1	differ	1	on	1	whether	1	the-use	1	heuristics	1	is	1	irrational.	1
1725	a-cognitive-laziness-approach	1	argues	1	that	1	heuristics	1	are	1	inevitable-shortcuts	1	given	1	the-limitations	1	of	1	the-human-brain.	1
1726	this	2	has	1	led	1	to	1	a-theory	1	called	1	"attribute	1	substitution",	1	which	1	says	1	that	2	people	2	often	1	handle	1	a-complicated-question	1	by	1	answering	1	a-different,-related-question,	1	without	1	being	1	aware	1	is	1	what	1	are	1	doing.	1
1727	a-third-approach	1	argues	1	that	1	heuristics	1	perform	1	just	1	as	2	well	1	more-complicated-decision-making-procedures,	1	but	1	more	1	quickly	1	and	1	with	1	less-information.	1
1728	an-effort-reduction-framework	1	proposed	1	by	1	anuj-k.-shah	1	and	1	daniel-m.-oppenheimer	1	states	1	that	1	people	1	use	1	a-variety	1	of	2	techniques	1	to	1	reduce	1	the-effort	1	making	1	decisions.	1
1729	this	1	explains	1	why	2	individuals	2	can	1	be	1	unaware	1	of	2	own	1	biases,	1	and	1	biases	1	persist	1	even	1	when	1	the-subject	1	is	1	made	1	aware	1	individuals.	1
1730	substitution	1	is	2	not	1	expected	1	to	1	take	1	place	1	in	1	answering	1	factual-questions	1	that	1	can	1	be	1	retrieved	1	directly	1	from	1	memory	1	("what	1	your-birthday?")	1
1731	gerd-gigerenzer	1	and	1	colleagues	1	have	1	argued	1	that	2	heuristics	1	can	1	be	1	used	1	to	1	make	1	judgments	1	are	1	accurate	1	rather	1	than	1	biased.	1
1732	according	1	to	2	gerd-gigerenzer	1	and	1	colleagues,	1	heuristics	1	are	2	"fast-and-frugal"-alternatives	1	more-complicated-procedures,	1	giving	1	answers	1	that	1	just	1	as	1	good.	1
1733	warren-thorngate,	1	a-social-psychologist,	1	implemented	1	ten-simple-decision-rules	1	or	1	heuristics	1	in	1	a-computer-program.	1
1734	legal-scholar-cass-sunstein	1	has	1	argued	1	that	1	attribute-substitution	1	is	1	pervasive	1	when	1	people	1	reason	1	about	1	moral,-political-or-legal-matters.	1
1735	given	1	a-difficult,-novel-problem	1	in	1	these-areas,	1	people	1	search	1	for	1	a-more-familiar,-related-problem	1	(a-"prototypical-case")	1	and	1	apply	1	its-solution	1	as	1	the-solution	1	to	1	the-harder-problem.	1
1736	according	1	to	1	sunstein,	1	the-opinions	1	of	1	trusted-political-or-religious-authorities	1	can	1	serve	1	as	1	heuristic-attributes	1	when	1	people	2	are	1	asked	1	own	1	opinions	1	on	1	a-matter.	1
1737	this	1	explains	1	how	1	there	1	are	2	often	1	two-ways	1	we	1	able	1	to	1	process	1	information	1	from	1	persuasive-messages,	1	one	1	being	1	heuristically	1	and	1	the	1	other	1	systematically.	1
