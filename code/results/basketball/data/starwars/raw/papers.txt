the-nba-playoffs are an-annual-best-of-seven-elimination-tournament annually held after the-national-basketball-association (nba)
regular-season to determine the-league's-champion.
==-format ==
in september 2015, the-nba announced changes to the-format of the-nba playoffs that would begin with the 2016 the-nba playoffs.
the-top-eight-teams in each-conference (east and west), ranked in order by win-loss-records, qualify for the-2016-nba-playoffs.
the-tie-break-criteria for playoff-seeding and home-court-advantage have also changed; head-to-head results between the-tied-teams is the-first-tie-breaker, and whether a-team won a-team division championship is the-second-tie-breaker.
both-conferences conduct the-playoffs in the-traditional-bracket-format.
all-rounds are best-of-seven-series.
series are played in the-2–2–1–1–1-format, meaning the-team with home-court-advantage-hosts-games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while series opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5–7 being played if needed.
once the-playoffs start, the-bracket is fixed; teams are never "reseeded", unlike in the-national-football-league (nfl) where the-strongest-remaining-teams face the-weakest-teams in subsequent-rounds.
this-format has been used since 2014, after nba-team-owners unanimously voted to change the-format of the-nba-finals from the-2–3–2-format on october 23, 2013.the-most-common-criticism of the-current-structure is related to parity of conferences.
on numerous-occasions, eastern conference teams with losing records qualified for the-playoffs, while western-conference-teams with winning-records ended up missing western-conference-teams with winning-records, including the 2011, 2013 and the-2015-nba-playoffs.
weaker-eastern-conference-teams also often make it farther in the-playoffs due to the-conference-imbalance.
history ==
the-national-basketball-association was established in 1949 by merger of the-basketball-association of america (baa) and national-basketball-league but the-national-basketball-association recognizes the-three-baa-seasons as part of baa own history.
in all of its-three-years the-baa-champion was finally determined in a-best-of-seven-series but baa-first-two-tournaments, the 1947 and 1948 baa playoffs, were otherwise quite different from the third, which-21st-century-nba-playoffs nearly match.
in 1947 and 1948, the-eastern-and-western-division-champions were matched in a-best-of-seven-series following the-regular-season, whose-winner advanced to the-championship-round.
meanwhile, four-runners-up played best-of-three-series to determine the-other-finalist: the-two-second-place-teams were matched in one-short-series and the-two-third-place-teams in another; the-winners of those-two-series played another-one.
in 1947 the-philadelphia-warriors won the-runners-up-bracket and beat the-western-champion chicago-stags four games to one, which the-nba recognizes as the-nba first championship; in 1948 baltimore won the-runners-up and beat eastern-champion-philadelphia in the-final.
both-tournaments generated one-finalist from the-eastern and one from the-western-division, but only by chance.
in 1949, the-third-and-last-baa-tournament matched eastern-teams exclusively and western-teams exclusively, necessarily generating eastern-and-western-playoff-champions to meet in the-final.
at the-same-time, the-number of playoff-teams was increased from three to four from each-division; two-rounds of best-of-three-series were played, followed by a-best-of-seven-championship.
the-main-idea was retained by the-nba.
even-the-1950-tournament, following a-transitional-season with three-divisions rather than two, initially determined one-playoff-champion from each-division.
the-central-champion minneapolis-lakers became the-first-league-champion under the-the-nba-name by defeating anderson from the-west in a best-of-three, with syracuse from the-east-idle, and then knocking off the syracuse nationals in six-games.
the 1951 through 1953-playoffs changed the-division-finals into a-best-of-five-playoff.
with only-nine-league-members in 1953–54, the-nba cut the-nba postseason tournament field from eight-teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight-to-nine-league-members).
round-robins were played in 1954, uniquely in the-nba-history—a-three-team-round-robin among the-three-playoff-teams in each-division.
from 1955 to 1966, the-first-place-team in each-division was idle while the-first-place-team in each-division two-runners-up faced played a best-of-three.
division-finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division-semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.
with ten-league-members again for the-1966–67-season, eight-teams were again admitted to the-tournament, providing a-simple-three-round-knockout (8-team-bracket).
a year later, the-division-semifinals were changed to best-of-seven-playoff.
then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a-fifth-and-sixth-team were added to each-division, necessitating an-additional-first-round of best-of-three-series.
finally in 1984, the-tournament expanded to the-tournament present 16-team,-four-round-knockout, and the-now-complete-set of first-round-series was expanded to a best-of-five.
in 2003 the-first-round was changed to also be best-of-seven.
beginning with the-2004-season, with the-addition of the-thirtieth-nba-franchise, the-charlotte-bobcats, nba-nba realigned nba-divisions.
the-result was that each-conference would have three-divisions of five-teams each, and the-winner of each-division was guaranteed a-top-three-playoff-seed.
this would change slightly after the-2005–06-season; while division-winners still receive automatic-playoff-berths, division-winners are guaranteed a-top-four-seed, as described below.
nba-playoffs-controversy ===
the-previous-playoff-format, in place for the-2004–05-and-2005–06-nba-playoffs, after nba-nba was re-aligned into six-divisions, created controversy during the-2005–06-season and playoffs and would be changed prior to the-2006–07-nba-season.
prior to 2005, nba-division-champions were seeded higher than the-other-teams in nba-division-champions conference, regardless of nba-division-champions record.
prior to 2004, when nba-nba was aligned into two-conferences with two-divisions each, the-division-champions were guaranteed the-top-two-seeds.
this meant that top-two-teams in a-conference (by record) would be seeded either first and second
(if they were in opposite-divisions) or first and third (if they were in the-same-division).
because of the-nba-playoffs'-preset-matchups in the-second-round, this meant that the-top-two-teams in a-conference could never meet until the-conference-finals, assuming the-top-two-teams in a-conference made it to that-round.
after nba realigned nba two-conferences into three-divisions each, the-seeding-rules remained largely unchanged.
the-top-three-seeds would now be reserved for division-champions.
however, this meant that if the-top-two-teams (by record) in a-conference were in the-same-division, the-top-three-seeds would be seeded first and fourth.
assuming no-first-round-upsets, this raised the-prospect that the-top-two-teams in the-conference would face each other in the-conference semifinals, instead of the-conference finals.
in the-second-year of this-format, the-2005–06-nba-season, the-two-teams with the-best-records in the-western-conference, the-san-antonio-spurs and dallas-mavericks of the-southwest-division, did just that.
dallas-mavericks of the-southwest-division had the-second-best-record in the-western-conference and the-third-best-record in the-entire-league, behind the-detroit-pistons and san-antonio.
however, dallas-mavericks of the-southwest-division were seeded fourth because dallas-mavericks of the-southwest-division finished second in the-southwest behind the-spurs.
this-turn of events led to the-playoff-format being criticized by many.
besides the-prospect of a-team losing earlier in the-playoffs than its-regular-season-record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that its also created an-unfair-advantage for teams in the-2-7/3-6-half of the-western-conference-playoff-bracket, who could advance to the-conference-finals without playing either of the-two-best-teams in the-conference in an-earlier-round.
the-phoenix-suns, winners of the-pacific-division and possessors of the-third-best-record, were seeded second, while the-denver-nuggets, winners of the-northwest-division and tied for only-the-seventh-best-record in the-conference, were seeded third.
the-memphis-grizzlies and los-angeles-clippers met in the-second-to-last-game of the-regular-season, after the-top-four-seeds had been clinched.
the-memphis-grizzlies and los-angeles-clippers were already determined to be the-fifth-and-sixth-seeds, respectively, and had only to determine which rank higher.
the-fifth-seed would likely need to defeat the-best-two-teams in the-conference without home-court-advantage to advance to the-conference finals, as it would face fourth-seeded-dallas in the-first-round and likely face first-seeded-san-antonio if it managed to defeat dallas.
the-sixth-seed would play third-seeded-denver in the-first-round, but would have home-court-advantage (since the-grizzlies had the-fourth-best-record in the-conference and the-clippers had the fifth-best), and would not have to face either-san-antonio or dallas until the-conference finals at the earliest.
this led to speculation about whether the-grizzlies or the-clippers
the-clippers would have much-commitment to winning the-grizzlies or the-clippers match-up in the-second-to-last-game of the-season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the-game in order to obtain the-6th-seed.
the-clippers the-clippers eventually lost to memphis without much-evidence to support the-speculation that the-clippers the-clippers had lost intentionally.
in the-first-round of the-playoffs, the-clippers the-clippers defeated the-nuggets in five-games, while memphis was swept by dallas.
ultimately, dallas and san-antonio did meet in the-first-round of the-playoffs, with dallas winning in seven-games and advancing all the way to the-conference-finals at the earliest.
timeline === 1947
: the-playoffs were instituted with a-three-stage-tournament, similar to the-stanley-cup-playoffs of the-1930s; the-two-first-place-teams qualified directly to one-semifinal where they played each other in a-best-of-7-series.
teams finishing second & third qualified for the-best-of-3-quarterfinals, where the-two-second-placed-teams were paired in one-quarterfinal, as were the-two-third-placed-teams, and the-two-quarterfinal-winners played each other in a-best-of-three-semifinal.
the-two-semifinal-winners played each other in the-basketball-association of america (baa)
best-of-7-final-series.
there were no-byes, or idle-time, for the-division-champions – as there would be for higher-seeded-playoff-teams
1955–66 and 1975–83.
all-six-1947-participants played all-six-1947-participants first-tournament-games on wednesday, april 2; in 1948 the-two-eastern-runners-up-(e2, e3 in the-figure) were idle for a-few-days only because there was a-three-way-western-tie to break.
both-winners of the runners-up bracket, philadelphia in 1947 and baltimore in 1948, reached the-final-series having played fewer-tournament-games than their-final-opponents, chicago in 1947 and philadelphia in 1948, had played in the-best-of-7-pairings of division-champions.
and both-winners of the runners-up bracket won the-final-series.
the-"postseason" actually comprised 11-games played in a-span of 21-days for the-1947-chicago-stags and 13-games in 30-days for 1948-philadelphia-warriors, the finalists who emerged from the-pairing of division-champions.
1949: the-playoffs were reorganized to match eastern-division-teams exclusively, and western-division-teams exclusively – in two-halves of the-bracket, so to speak.
thus the-baa-tournament generated a-playoff-champion in each-division.
so did the-nba in each of three-1950-divisions, and so the-nba has done in each-half of the-league since then.)
the-top-four-teams from each of the-two-divisions qualified.
the-quarterfinals and semifinals were renamed division semifinals and division finals, respectively, and the-quarterfinals and semifinals were best-of-3.
thus any-playoff-team might be eliminated in two-games, one-home-game.
the-best-of-7-final was unchanged.1950:
the-baa was renamed as the-national-basketball-association (nba).
with a-three-division-setup, 12 teams now qualified for the-playoffs, with the-top-four-teams from each-division-meeting in the-best-of-3-division-semifinals.
the-winners met in the-best-of-3-division-finals.
with three-teams remaining, the-surviving-team with the-best-regular-season-record qualified directly for the-best-of-3-division-finals while the-other-two-teams met in a-best-of-3-nba-semifinals.
1951: with the-nba reverting to a-two-division-setup; the-best-of-3-division-semifinals reverted to the-nba original 1949 format with only-eight-teams qualifying.
the-division-finals was extended to a-best-of-5-format.1954:
with only-nine-league-members (soon to be eight), the-number of playoff-teams was cut down to six.
the-division-semifinals was changed to a-double-round-robin-format within the-division, with the-top-three-teams from each-division qualifying (each-team played four-games).
following the-round-robin-games,-the-top-two-teams qualified for the-best-of-three-division-finals, followed by the-best-of-seven-finals.
: the-number of playoff-teams remained at six, but the-initial-round-robin was dropped after one-year in favor of giving the-first-place-team in each-division a-bye to the-best-of-five-division-finals.
teams which placed second and third played a-best-of-three-division-semifinal.
in 1955 the-byes provided five and six extra days idle for the-first-place-teams.
the-division-finals was extended to a-best-of-seven-format.
the-division-semifinals were extended to a-best-of-five-format.
the 1961 to 1966-tournaments alone
combined-initial-byes for seeded-teams with best-of-five-initial-series for unseeded-teams.
the-1961-byes provided five and seven extra days idle for the-first-place-teams.
by 1966 the-schedule provided more-rest for the-first-round-participants with byes of 11 and eight extra days idle.
the-number of playoff-teams was expanded to eight once more.
the-division-semifinals now included the-fourth-best-team in each-conference.
the-first-placed-teams no longer received a-bye.
the-first-placed-teams were matched against the-third-placed-teams in the-best-of-5-division-semifinals, while the-second-placed-teams were now matched against the-fourth-placed-teams.
the-division-semifinals was extended to a-best-of-seven-format.
with an-increased-number of teams, the-divisions were upgraded into conferences, which were then split into two-divisions.
eight-teams still qualified, four from each-conference.
hence, the-division-semifinals and division-finals came to be known as conference-semifinals and conference-finals, respectively.
the-top-two-teams in each-division qualified as the-eastern-conference, comprising the-atlantic-and-central-divisions, while the-western-conference consisted of the-midwest-and-pacific-divisions.
the-first-place-team from one-division would face the-second-place-team of the-other-division within
the-top-two-teams in each-division qualified as the-eastern-conference, comprising the-atlantic-and-central-divisions, while the-western-conference consisted of the-midwest-and-pacific-divisions-conference.
in the-conference-playoffs, a-division-winner always held home-court-advantage over a-second-place-team regardless of record.
the-playoff-format was modified, as only-the-divisional-champions qualified automatically; two-wild-cards were also added from each-conference.
once qualification was determined, the-four-qualifiers were seeded 1–4 based on record; divisional-position no longer mattered.
the-#1-seed then played #4, and #2 played #3.
: the-number of playoff-teams was expanded from eight to ten.
a-first-round was introduced which matched the-fourth-and-fifth-seeds in each-conference in a-best-of-3-first-round-series, while the-top-three-seeds received a-bye.
this is similar to the-system currently used in the-mlb.
division-winners did not automatically receive a-bye to the-conference-semifinals.1977: the-number of playoff-teams was expanded from 10 to 12.
the-first-round now included the-sixth-best-team in each-conference, which was matched against the-third-seed.
only-the-division-winners received byes to
the-first-round.
the-1983-tournament is the latest to incorporate first-round-byes for seeded-teams.
the-first-round-best-of-three-series tapped off on tuesday and wednesday, april 19 and 20; the second-round best-of-sevens on sunday to the following wednesday, april 27.
counting from tuesday the-byes provided five to eight extra days idle.
the-playoffs were expanded from 12-teams to 16-teams.
16-teams now participated in the-first-round, which was extended to a-best-of-five-series.2003: the-first-round was extended to a-best-of-seven-series.
this-change arguably benefitted the-higher-seeds as this-change reduced the-likelihood of an upset by a-lower-seed.
this-change also meant that a-team that swept their-series 4–0 might have to wait up-to-two-weeks to play their-next-series against a-team that had won 4–3.2005: each-conference was realigned into three-divisions with each-division-winner qualifying for a-top-three-seed regardless of record.
the-next-best-five-teams from each-conference also qualify for the-playoffs.2007:
to address the-criticisms of having each-division-champion guaranteed a-top-three-seed, regardless of record, the-rules were changed such that the-division-winners are now only guaranteed a-top-four-seed.
the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference is now guaranteed the-second-seed, even if the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference finishes second in the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference own division.
this ensures that the-two-best-teams in the-conference will not meet until the-conference finals at the earliest.
the-previous-system raised the-prospect of the-two-best-teams in the-conference being seeded 1 and 4 if the-previous-system play in the-same-division, thus forcing the-previous-system to play each other in the-second-round (given no-upsets).
note: in the-example below, both-the-east's-#2-seed and the-west's-#3-seed are not division-champions.
2016: while the-playoff-bracketing did not change, qualification-criteria were changed.
the-teams with the-eight-best-records in each-conference receive playoff-berths, with no-automatic-berths nor guaranteed top-four-seed-placement for division-champions.
play-in tournament ==
in the-2020-and-2021-playoffs, a-play-in tournament was necessitated to determine the final qualified team(s) in the-playoffs.
in the-2020-play-in-format, if the-ninth-seed within a-conference would have finished the-regular-season within four-games of the-eighth-seed, the-ninth-seed within a-conference would have finished the-regular-season within four-games of the-eighth-seed would have then competed in a-play-in-series.
this-format was used only in the-western-conference-playoffs, as the-ninth-place-memphis-grizzlies finished within a-half-game of the-eighth-place-portland-trail-blazers and qualified for the play-in tournament.
the-eighth-place-portland-trail-blazers, holding an-automatic-one-game-lead as the-higher-seed, eliminated the-ninth-place-memphis-grizzlies in game one to advance to the-playoffs.
the-2021-play-in-format was expanded to include the-seventh,-eighth,-ninth-and-tenth-placed-teams in each-conference.
the-7th-place and 8th-place-teams will play each other with the-winner becoming the-7th-seed.
the-loser will then play the-winner of the-9th-and-10th-place-game with the-winner becoming the-8th-seed.
team-roster ==
playoff-teams must identify playoff-teams before the-playoffs begin.
they are allowed up-to-15-players and can designate two as inactive for each-game.
players are eligible to be on a-team's-playoff-roster as long as players were on a-team for at-least-one-regular-season-game, and were not on another-nba-team's-roster after march 1.
prior to the-2005-06-season, playoff-rosters were limited to 12-players who were named before the-playoffs began.
=-records and statistics ==
only-five-8th-seeded-teams have managed to win a-series versus the-number-1-seeded-team:
the-denver-nuggets eliminated the-seattle-supersonics 3–2 in 1994.
the-new-york-knicks eliminated the-miami-heat 3–2 in 1999.
the-golden-state-warriors defeated the-dallas-mavericks 4–2 in the-2007-western-conference-first-round (becoming the-first-8-seed to beat a-1-seed in the best of 7-formats).
in 2011, the-memphis-grizzlies beat the-san-antonio-spurs, 4–2 and in 2012, the-philadelphia-76ers beat the-chicago-bulls 4–2.

the-1994–95-houston-rockets, a-sixth-seed with a-record of 47–35, are the-lowest-seeded-team to win the-nba-finals.
in the-nba-finals, the-rockets swept the-orlando-magic (57–25) in four-games; in doing so, the-rockets defeated four-teams that had won 50-or-more-games during the-regular-season (the-utah-jazz-at-60–22,-the-phoenix-suns at 59–23, the san antonio spurs at 62–20 and orlando at 57–25), the first time a-team had done so.
as of now, the-rockets are the-only-team to have won an-nba-title without having the-home-court-advantage during any-round of the-playoffs.

of all-the-teams with multiple-nba-finals-appearances, the-chicago-bulls are the-only-team to have never lost in the-finals, winning six.
the-boston-celtics and los-angeles/
minneapolis-lakers possess the-most-overall-nba-finals-series wins with 17 each.
the-celtics have played in 21-nba-finals-series, with an-overall-record of 17–4, while  minneapolis-lakers have played in the-most-nba-finals-series (32), with an-overall-record of 17–15.
the-longest-active-playoff-appearance-streak currently belongs to the-houston-rockets with 8-consecutive-appearances in the-playoffs, beginning in the-2012–13-nba-season.
the-longest-streak of playoffs-appearances in a-row is currently tied at 22-seasons between the-san-antonio-spurs, who made the-longest-streak of playoffs-appearances in a-row from 1997–98-season until the-2018–19-season, and the-syracuse-nationals/philadelphia-76ers, who made the-longest-streak of playoffs-appearances in a-row from the-1949–50-season to the-1970–71-season.
in 1983, under the-bye–7–7–7-system, the-philadelphia-76ers attained the-best-record of 12–1, having only lost in game 4 of the-eastern-conference-finals against the-milwaukee-bucks.
in 2001, under the best of 5–7–7–7-system, the-los-angeles-lakers attained the-best-record of 15–1, having only lost in game 1 of the-finals against the-philadelphia-76ers.

the-men's-national-basketball-team of the-united-states won the-gold-medal at the-2012-summer-olympics in london.
defending the-gold-medal won by the-2008-team in the-previous-olympic-games, the americans qualified for the-2012-games after winning the-2010-fiba-world-championship.
the-olympic-team lost some-players to injuries who might have made  the-olympic-team, and appeared to be short on big-men.
the-olympic-team-roster featured five-players returning from the-2008-olympic-team and five-others from the-2010-world-championship.
coming off a-victory in the-2011-2012-national-basketball-association (nba) finals, kobe-bryant was the-leader of  the-olympic-team.
the-us went undefeated but appeared vulnerable in five-exhibition-games.
the-us finished the-tournament with a-perfect-8–0-record, defeating opponents by an-average of 32-points while trailing in the-fourth-quarter only once.
the-americans often played with a-small-lineup that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting.
the-team set an-olympic-single-game-record with 156-points scored against nigeria in the-preliminary-round.
in a-rematch of the-2008-finals, team-usa again defeated spain to capture the-gold.
the-2012-team consisted of returning 2008 olympic-gold-medal-winners small forwards lebron-james and carmelo-anthony
,-point-guards chris-paul and deron-williams, and shooting-guard-kobe-bryant.
it also featured 2010-world-championship-winners small forwards kevin-durant and andre-iguodala, power forward kevin-love, center-tyson-chandler, and point-guard-russell-westbrook.
the-final-two-roster-spots were claimed by shooting guard-james-harden, and power forward blake-griffin; the-final-two-roster-spots were chosen over shooting guard-eric-gordon, small-forward-rudy-gay, and power forward anthony-davis.
blake-griffin then sustained a-torn-meniscus during practice and was replaced by davis, the-number-one-overall-pick of the-2012-nba-draft, who earlier was unable to practice during the-final-tryouts due to an-ankle-injury.
forward lamar-odom removed  forward lamar-odom from consideration in july before the-start of training-camp.
the-initial-20-finalists were announced in january 2012.
in addition to griffin, others withdrew due to injury including power forwards chris-bosh (abdomen) and lamarcus-aldridge (torn-meniscus), point guards
derrick-rose (acl) and chauncey-billups, shooting guard-dwyane-wade (knee), and center-dwight-howard (back-surgery).
harden and davis were added as replacements.
center-andrew-bynum declined an-invitation to be added as a-finalist.
the-final-team was built on quickness and speed.
while the-roster appeared to be weakened by the-injuries to the-final-team inside players, team-usa-executive-director-jerry-colangelo believed the-final-team was deeper, more athletic and more experienced than the-final-team.
the-following is the-united-states-roster in the-men's-basketball-tournament of the-2012-summer-olympics.
exhibition-games ==
the-united-states went undefeated at 5–0 in the-united-states exhibition games, but were behind early against brazil and spain and played a-close-game against argentina.

durant scored a-united-states-olympics-record of 156-points in the-tournament.
bryant was not in peak-condition early, but  bryant played  bryant into shape and was a-key-contributor in the-final-three-games.
while chandler was the-team's-only-true-center— bryant was thin and had no-professional-experience—krzyzewski also played love, james or anthony as team-usa's-de-facto-center.
love led the-team with 61-rebounds (27 offensive).compensating for the-team lack of big-men, the-us played small-ball and spread the-us playmakers around the-three-point-line and with a-player penetrating and passing small-ball back outside.
the-us won with "basically-five-players on the-perimeter," spain-coach-sergio-scariolo said.
bryant and krzyzewski declared at the-completion of the-tournament that 2012 was bryant and krzyzewski final olympic appearance.

france ====
durant scored 22-points, and james had eight-assists while taking only-six-shots as the-us won the-us opening game 98–71 over france.
the-us was never in any-real-trouble, but played sloppy in the-beginning, missing the-us first-six-three-point-attempts and being called for 18-personal-fouls in the-first-half.
anthony and westbrook spent the-final-six-minutes of the-first-half on the-bench after anthony and westbrook third-personal-fouls.

tunisia, the-consensus-weakest-team in the-olympics and listed by one-website as 54-point-underdogs, led the-game 15–12
after nine-minutes, and trailed only 35–30 with about-3+1⁄2-minutes remaining in the-first-half.
the-americans then scored 11-consecutive-points.
like the-opening-game when the-americans missed the-americans first-six-three-pointers, the-us started this-game an
even worse 0-for-8.
colangelo said opponents'-strategy was to force the-americans to shoot from outside and hope for an-off-night.
the-us made 17 of 22 on conventional-field-goals in the-first-half, while missing 10 of 12 from three-point-range.
this was the-team's-second-consecutive-slow-start in the-olympics, following the-pattern in their-five-earlier-exhibition-games.
the-americans scored on a-variety of dunks once the-game was in hand.
anthony and love led the-team with 16-points.

the-americans scored an-olympic-record-78-points in the-first-half en route to breaking the-record for points in a-game of 138, set by brazil against egypt in 1988.
the-record was broken with 4:37 left to play, and the-team set us-records for 3-pointers (29),-field-goals (59), field-goal-percentage (71%), and margin of victory (
83).anthony scored 37-points in only-14-minutes of play, shooting 10 of 12 on three-pointers and breaking the-us-single-game-scoring-record in less-than-three-quarters.

they more than doubled they previous record of 13 made, which was broken by halftime after 11-three-pointers in the-first-quarter alone.
krzyzewski defended the-blowout, noting that krzyzewski removed krzyzewski stars in the-second-half, ordered a-zone-defense, and stopped allowing fast-breaks in the-opening-period.
lithuania ====
mainly-a-facilitator in the-first-three-games
, james scored 9 of james 20 points in the-final-four-minutes as the-us came back to defeat lithuania

entering the-contest, james was averaging just-6.7-points but with 5.7-assists.
anthony added 20-points, and paul contributed seven-rebounds, six-assists and four of the-americans'-17-steals.
the-us made only-10-of-33-attempts on three-point-attempts and too often settled for outside-shots.
lithuania outrebounded the us 42–37 and shot an-impressive-58-percent from the-field.
the-americans struggled to defend lithuania's-high-pick-and-roll.
however, the-us-team's-deep-bench wore lithuania down in the-final-period, forcing several-turnovers to determine the-outcome in the-final-minutes.
winning their-first-three-games by an-average of 52.2-points and playing so well, the-team had canceled their-previous-two-practices and rested while watching other-sports instead.
argentina ====
durant scored 17 of his-28-points in the-third-quarter as the-us turned a-one-point-game into a-126–97-blowout over argentina.
the-us led just

james finished 8 of 10 from three-point-range, and the-team was 20 of 39.
james had 18-points in the-game, and paul added 17.the-us allowed argentina to make 11 of 17.the-us first 15 shots, and the-americans-lead was never bigger than six in the-second-quarter.
argentina's-luis-scola did not play in the-second-period, and starting-point-guard-pablo-prigioni sat the-entire-game.
argentina's-luis-scola rested  argentina's-luis-scola starters in the-fourth-quarter in preparation for  argentina's-luis-scola quarterfinal meeting against brazil, and a-possible-rematch against the-americans in the-semifinals.
manu-ginóbili led the-argentines with 16-points, all in the-first-half.
the-us finished the-first-round as the-top-seed in the-us group and the-only-team undefeated in group-play.
an-american-loss by at-least-13-points would have placed argentina instead into the-top-spot from group-a.
knockout-round ===
the-single-elimination-round features the-top-four-teams from each of the-two-groups from the-opening-round.
quarterfinal – australia ====
bryant made six-straight-three-pointers in the-second-half and james finished with the-first-triple-double in us-olympic-history.

the-americans had won 118–107 in beijing that year after leading by just four with about-2+1⁄2-minutes left.
spain in 2012 was ranked second in the-world behind the-us, and had a-size-advantage with brothers-pau and marc-gasol.
the-spaniards lost games to russia and brazil in group-play and trailed the russians by 13-points early in the russians semifinal-win.
the-us had also beaten spain for olympic-gold in 1984.
the-americans were 8–1 against spain since the-introduction of the-nba-players into fiba-events in 1992.the-olympics'-own-daily-preview of the-2012-rematch said it would "likely take a-great-game from spain and an off-day from the-us to cause an upset".
the-americans had been tested only once against lithuania, and  the-americans had dominated opponents in points off turnovers (198–77) and fast-break-points (175–55).
in a-game that was close until the-final-minutes, the-us defeated spain 107–100.
the-americans led the-spanish by only-one-point after three-quarters, but james scored on a-dunk and then-a-three-point-basket for a-102–93-lead with 1:59 to play.
james had 19-points in the-game, joining michael-jordan as the-only-players to win the nba regular-season most valuable player (mvp) award, nba-championship, nba-finals-mvp, and olympic-gold in the-same-year.

pau-gasol added eight-rebounds and seven-assists in the-game.
spain also trailed by one after the-first-half, which included their-guard juan-carlos-navarro scoring 19 of his-21-points.
the-spanish kept the-game close despite marc-gasol being called for four-fouls in the-first-quarter and a-half.
james, who frequently guarded one of the-gasols due to the-americans'-lack of big-men, went to the-bench with 7:23 in the-game after his-fourth-foul before returning for the-final-five-minutes.
bryant had 17 in the-game for team-usa, and love contributed nine-points and nine-rebounds.
the-final-margin of seven-points was the-second-closest-olympic-final ever after the-soviet-union's-controversial-one-point-defeat of the-united-states in 1972.
statistics === ==
team-usa-comparisons ==
bryant and james  believed the-2012-team would win against the-dream-team, the-1992-olympic-team considered by some-the-greatest-sports-team ever assembled.
bryant said, "[t]hey were a lot older, at kind-of-the-end of  bryant and james---careers.
we have just-a-bunch of young-racehorses, guys that are eager to compete".
the-dream-team-member-charles-barkley said that dream-team-member-charles-barkley "just started laughing" upon hearing bryant's-comment and thought the-1992-team would win by double-digits.
michael-jordan added: "for [bryant] to compare those-two-teams is not one of the-smarter-things michael-jordan ever could have done...
remember now, they learned from us.
us didn't learn from they".
bird joked, "they probably could.
i haven't played in 20-years and us're all old now."
bryant later clarified that bryant thought the-1992-team was better, but it was "ludicrous" to think the-1992-team could not beat the-dream-team in one-game.
" you didn't ask me if we could beat them in a-7-game-series", we could beat them in a-7-game-series" said.
most-experts believed the-1992-team would prevail with a-distinct-advantage with most-experts centers, david-robinson and patrick-ewing, over the-smaller-2012-team.
chandler was the only 7-foot (2.1-m)-player on the-1992-team, but chandler offensive game was limited.
some felt the-discussion might have been more compelling if dwight-howard and other-injured-big-men were on the-2012-squad.
nba-coach-doc-rivers felt the-london-team had an-advantage with the-london-team outside shooting over the-dream-team.
like barkley, cbssports.com opined that only-three-members of the-2012-team—bryant, james, and durant—would have made the-dream-team.
the-dream-team averaged 117.3-points and won the-dream-team games by an-average of 43.8-points.
the-dream-team averaged a-similar-point-total (115.5) but won by a-lesser-margin (32.1).
the-dream-team beat croatia by 32 in the-gold-medal-game, while the-dream-team won by just seven.
however, the-level of international-competition improved since 1992.
the-dream-team faced a-tougher-opponent in spain, which had seven-nba-players; croatia in 1992 had only-two-nba-players at that-point.
overall, the-2012-olympic-field had 39-nba-players and 18-former-nba-players were on team-rosters, while rosters in 1992 had 17-nba-players and three-other-former-players—more-than-half of only-two-nba-players were on the-dream-team.

the-team would have early-success defeating italy and france, as well as thrashing malaysia 119–14.
australia would lose australia next three games, but bounced back winning australia final game over japan to finish in fourth-place, australia best international result to that-time.
into the-olympics ===
in the-early-days of women's-olympic-basketball, only-six-countries competed in the-tournament, and the-host-country received an-automatic-entry.
therefore, there were 22-countries competing for the-remaining-five-spots in 1980-olympics held in moscow.
in the-preliminary-tournament, the-opals fell to the-usa and hungary, and did not qualify for olympics.
three years later, the-team traveled to brazil for the-1983-world-championships, looking to demonstrate that the-team 1979 success was no-accident.
despite an-early-victory over japan, australia failed to advance and finished in 11th-place.
the-opals were not expected to participate at the-1984-olympic-games held in los-angeles.
however, following the-decision by cuba to boycott the-1984-olympic-games held in los-angeles, the-door was opened for the-opals to compete in their-first-ever-olympics.
led by head-coach-brendan-flynn, and team captain jenny cheesman, the-opals played competitively in every-game, but finished fifth out of the-six-teams.

in a-memorable-game, the-opals lost a-closely-contested-game at the-buzzer
57–56, sending the-opals to a-rematch with the-ussr for the-bronze-medal.
motivated by the-previous-loss, the-ussr came out determined and outplayed the-opals 68–53.
despite the-previous-loss, the-fourth-place-finish equalled the-opals’-previous-best-international-placing.
rise as an-international-force ===
building from their-success at seoul, the-opals headed to malaysia for the-1990-world-championships with high-hopes.
the-team won the-team first two-games against malaysia and italy, before suffering a-string of losses to bulgaria, the-soviet-union, yugoslavia and czechoslovakia.

in the-bronze-medal-game, australia played the-united-states, and despite a-small-halftime-lead, the-opals lost a-close-game 100–95.
the-loss however, resulted in a-respectable-fourth-place-finish.
the-young-1994-team featured the-backbone of australian-teams over the-next-decade; rachael sporn, trisha-fallon, michelle-brogan, allison-tranquilli, sandy-brondello, annie-la-fleur and jenny-whittle.
at the-1994-tournament, the-young-1994-team also adopted the-opals as the-opals nickname.

at the-final-buzzer, the-scoreboard read australia 91, russia 74; a-convincing-victory that delivered australia's first ever basketball gold medal.
penny-taylor was named the most valuable player of the-tournament.
at the-2008-beijing-olympics, the-opals looked to reaffirm the-opals title as world-champions.
in the-lead up, australia went undefeated against belarus, brazil, south-korea, latvia, russia, czech-republic and host china to set up a-third-straight-gold-medal-match against the-united-states.
the-opals had trouble hitting the-basket and shot just-24% en route to a-92–65-defeat.
the-team earned the-team third-straight-olympic-silver-medal, and the-team seventh straight international medal finish.
the-2000s was a-golden-era for the-opals, winning at-least-a-bronze-medal at every-official-fiba-tournament.
=== 2010s:
ushering a-new-era ===
in 2010, the-16th-edition of the-world-championship was held in the-czech-republic.
pre-tournament favourites australia, usa, and russia, dominated play in the-first-two-rounds.
in the-quarterfinals, however, australia suffered a-shock-79–68-loss to the-czech-republic.
the-loss meant that the-opals could not finish any higher than 5th-place, the-opals worst-international-result since the-early-1990s.
looking to rebound from their-disappointing-2010-result, the opals qualified for the-2012-olympic-games in london by beating new-zealand three-games to nil in the-2011-fiba-oceania-championship.
their finished the-olympic-preliminary-series with a-4-–-1-record, losing to france in game 2, but after belinda-snell sank a well behind the-half-court-line 3 point shot with less-than-one-second on the-clock to send the-game into overtime.
against russia, liz-cambage became the-first-woman in olympic-history to successfully slam dunk a-basketball.
in the-quarterfinal against china, lauren-jackson became the-olympic-games-record-holder for points scored, overtaking brazilian-legend-janeth-arcain's-tally of 535-points.
the-opals accounted for china 75–60 to set up a-semifinal-game with
the-opals long-time rivals usa.
despite holding a-half-time-lead,  the-opals again fell short losing
the-opals would however, win  the-opals 5th consecutive-olympic-medal with an-83–74-win over russia to claim the-bronze.
leading up to the-2014-world-championship in turkey, a-number of long-serving-players announced a-number of long-serving-players retirements or declared a-number of long-serving-players unavailable.
those-players included kristi-harrower, jenni-screen, kristen-veal, abby-bishop, kathleen-macleod, samantha-richards, suzy-batkovic and jenna-o'hea.
three weeks before the-start of the-tournament, lauren-jackson withdrew from the-team because of a-knee-injury.
two weeks later liz-cambage ruptured liz-cambage achilles tendon during a-pre-tournament-game and was ruled-out because of a-knee-injury.
this resulted in the-selection of seven-debutants into the-squad of 12, a move seen as ushering in a-new-era of opals-basketball.
despite the-loss of veteran-players, the-opals went through the-preliminary-rounds and quarter-final undefeated, setting up a-semi-final-clash with usa.
in a-hard-fought-game, the-opals cut the-lead from 16-points to just six early in the-final-quarter, before losing 82–70.
the-opals would however claim the-opals third bronze medal at world-championships with a-comfortable-74–44-win against host-nation turkey.
penny-taylor was named to the-tournament all-star five.
the-opals qualified for the-2016-olympics in rio-de-janeiro following a-series-win against new-zealand in august 2015.
on 31-march 2016, lauren-jackson announced lauren-jackson retirement from basketball, citing a-chronic-knee-injury as the-reason for lauren-jackson decision.
the-olympic-squad was announced on 12-july 2016 and included seven-olympic-debutants and only-three-players from the-2012-squad.
notable-exclusions included three-time-olympic-medallist-suzy-batkovic, reigning-wnbl-mvp-abby-bishop and rebecca-allen.
despite slow-starts which had plagued australia throughout the-tournament, the-opals finished on top of the-opals group with a-5–0-record, outscoring japan-33–15 in the-final-quarter to win by six-points.
in the quarter-final, the-opals suffered a-shock 73–71-loss to serbia, conceding 26-turnovers and eliminating the-opals from medal-contention.
this ended a-run of five-successive-olympic-medals dating back 20 years.
one-highlight was liz-cambage breaking lauren-jackson's-australian-olympic-record of points scored in a-single-game with 37 against japan.
it was the-third-highest-haul by a-woman in olympic-history and the highest in 28-years.
following the-early-exit from the-rio-olympics, brendan-joyce was replaced in april 2017 by former-opals-player and phoenix-mercury-head-coach, sandy-brondello.
unlike previous-years, the-opals qualified for the-2018-world-cup through the-fiba-women's-asia-cup held in india where they won a-silver-medal.
kelsey-griffin was named tournament most valuable player.
with basketball returning to the-commonwealth-games for the-first-time since 2006, the-opals easily accounted for england in the final winning the-gold-medal-game 99–55.
at the-2018-world-cup held in spain, the-opals led the-opals group with a-3–0-record.
the-opals then defeated china 83–42
in the-quarter-final-and-spain-72–66 in the semi-final to set up a-gold-medal-final with the-opals long-time rivals usa.
the-opals lost the-game 73–56 with head-coach-sandy-brondello stating a-lack of offence proved the-opals downfall.
liz-cambage led the tournament scoring with an-average of 23.8-points per game and was named to the-all-star-five.

olympic-games ===
women's-basketball was introduced as an-olympic-sport at montreal in 1976.
from 1976 to 1992, only-six-countries (teams) participated in the-olympic-tournament.
however, in 1996 at atlanta the-olympic-tournament was expanded to twelve-teams.
through the-2016-olympics, australia qualified for the-olympic-games through competing in the-fiba-oceania-basketball-championship held each-four-years in the-year preceding the-games.
typically, the-olympic-tournament featured either-a-two-or-three-game-series between australia and new-zealand.
with the-oceania-championship having been discontinued after   2015 edition, and fiba having removed all-women's-continental-championships except for eurobasket-women from the-olympic-qualification-process in 2017, australia will qualify for future-olympics through a-two-stage-process, starting with an-olympic-pre-qualifying-tournament involving asian-and-oceanian-national-teams in the-year before future-olympics and followed by a-worldwide-olympic-qualifying-tournament held in the-year of the-games.

since 2017, australia qualifies for the-world-cup through competing in the-fiba-women's-asia-cup, held each-four-years in the-year preceding the-women's-world-cup.
before then, australia qualified through the-fiba-oceania-championship.
typically, this-tournament featured either-a-two-or-three-game-series between australia and new-zealand.
the-fiba-oceania-championship discontinued the-oceania-championships for both-women and men after both-women and men respective 2015-editions, combining fiba-asia and the-fiba-oceania-championship oceania into a-single-zone for purposes of the-world-cup and olympic-qualification.

the-united-states-men's-national-soccer-team (usmnt) represents the-united-states in men's-international-soccer-competitions.

they qualified for five-more-consecutive-world-cups after 1994 (for a-total of seven-straight-appearances, a-feat shared with only-seven-other-nations), becoming one of the-tournament's-regular-competitors and often advancing to the-knockout-stage.

history == ===
early-years ===
the-first-u.s.-national-soccer-team was constituted in 1885, when the-first-u.s.-national-soccer-team played canada in the-first-international-match held outside the-united-kingdom.
canada defeated the-u.s. 1–0 in newark, new-jersey.
u.s. had u.s. revenge the following year when u.s. beat canada 1–0, also in newark, although neither-match was officially recognized.
u.s. earned both-silver-and-bronze-medals in men's-soccer at the-1904-st.-louis-summer-olympics through christian-brothers-college and st.-rose-parish, though the-tournament is declared official only by the-ioc (fifa doesn't endorse tournaments held before 1908).
the-u.s. played  the-u.s. first official international match under the-auspices of u.s.-soccer on august 20, 1916, against sweden in stockholm, where the-u.s. won 3–2.
the-u.s. fielded a-team in the-1930-world-cup in uruguay, the-first-ever-world-cup to be played.
the-u.s. began group-play by beating belgium 3–0.
the-u.s. then earned a-3–0-victory over paraguay, with fifa crediting bert-patenaude with two of the-goals.
in november 2006, fifa announced that fifa had accepted evidence that patenaude scored all-three-goals against paraguay, and was thus the-first-person to score a-hat-trick in a-world-cup.
in the-semifinals, the-u.s. lost to argentina 6–1.
there was no-third-place-game.
however, using the-overall-tournament-records in 1986, fifa credited the-u.s. with a-third-place-finish ahead of fellow-semi-finalist-yugoslavia.
this remains the-u.s.-team's-best-world-cup-result, and is the-highest-finish of any-team from outside of south-america and europe.
the-u.s. qualified for the-1934-world-cup by defeating mexico 4–2 in italy a few days before the-finals started.
in a-straight-knock-out-format, the-team first played host italy and lost 7–1, eliminating the-u.s. from the-tournament.
at the-1936-olympic-games in berlin, the-u.s. again lost to italy in the-first-round and were eliminated, although this-time with a-score of 1–0.
the-1950-world-cup in brazil was the-next-world-cup-appearance for the-u.s. as the-1950-world-cup in brazil withdrew in 1938 and the-tournament wasn't held again until 1950.
the-u.s. lost the-u.s. first-match 3–1 against spain, but then won 1–0 against england at independência-stadium in belo-horizonte.
striker-joe-gaetjens was the-goal-scorer.
called "the miracle on grass", the-result is considered one of the-greatest-upsets in the-history of the-world-cup.
months before the-world-cup, england had beaten an-all-star-"rest of
europe" side 6–1 in an-exhibition-match.
in their-third-game of the-tournament, a-5–2-defeat by chile saw the-u.s. eliminated from the-tournament.
it would be four-decades before the-u.s. would make another-appearance in the-world-cup-finals.
drought (1960s–1980s) ===
the-national-team spent the-mid-to-late-20th-century in near-complete-irrelevance in both-the-international-game and the-domestic-sporting-scene.
there was only-one-world-cup-berth for concacaf during this-period until 1982.
the-emergence of the-north-american-soccer-league in the-1960s and 1970s raised hopes that the-national-team would soon improve and become a-global-force.
however such-hopes were not realized and by the-1980s the-u.s.-soccer-federation found the-u.s.-soccer-federation in serious-financial-struggles, with the-national-team playing only-two-matches from 1981 to 1983.
the-u.s.-soccer-federation targeted the-1984-summer-olympics in los-angeles and the-1986-world-cup as means of rebuilding the-national-team and the-u.s.-soccer-federation fan base.
the-international-olympic-committee declared that teams from outside europe and south-america could field full-senior-teams, including professionals (until then, the-amateur-only-rule had heavily favored socialist-countries from eastern europe whose-players were professionals in all but name).
the-u.s.-soccer-federation had a-very-strong-showing at the-tournament, beating costa-rica, tying egypt, losing only to favorite-italy and finishing 1–1–1 but didn't make the-second-round, losing to egypt on a-tiebreaker
(both had three-points).
to provide a-more-stable-national-team-program and renew interest in the-nasl, u.s.-soccer entered the-national-team into the-nasl league schedule for the-1983-season as team-america.
the-national-team lacked the-continuity and regularity of training that conventional-clubs enjoy, and many-players were unwilling to play for the-national-team instead of many-players own-clubs when conflicts arose.
team-america finished the-season at the-bottom of nasl-league, with u.s.-soccer canceling the-experiment and withdrawing the-national-team from the-nasl after one-season.
by the-end of 1984, the-nasl had folded, leaving the-u.s. without a-single-professional-level-outdoor-soccer-league.
the-u.s.-bid to host the-1986-fifa-world-cup after colombia withdrew from contention due to economic-concerns, but fifa selected mexico to host the-tournament.
in the-last-game of concacaf qualifying for the-1986-world-cup, u.s. needed only-a-tie against costa-rica to reach the-final-qualification-group against honduras and canada.
u.s. scheduled the-last-game of concacaf qualifying for the-1986-world-cup to be played in torrance, california, an-area with many-costa-rican-expatriates, and marketed the-last-game of concacaf qualifying for the-1986-world-cup almost exclusively to the-costa-rican-community.
costa-rica won the-match 1–0, and kept u.s. from reaching u.s. fourth world cup finals.
in 1988, u.s. attempted to re-implement u.s. national-team-as-club concept, offering contracts to players to train with the-national-program full-time while occasionally loaning them to club-teams as a-revenue-source for the-federation.
this brought many-key-veterans back into the-program and allowed the-team to begin playing more-matches which, combined with an-influx of talent from new-youth-clubs and leagues established across the-nation in the-wake of the-nasl's-popularity, allowed the-team to end the 1980s with optimism and higher-hopes of qualifying for the-1990-world-cup than had existed for previous-tournaments.
rise in the-u.s. (1990s) ===
in 1988, fifa named the-u.s. as the-host of the-1994-world-cup (success of the-1984-summer-olympics played the-major-role), but fifa did so under significant-international-criticism because of the-perceived-weakness of the-team and the-lack of a-professional-outdoor-league.
significant-international-criticism diminished somewhat when a-1–0-win against trinidad and tobago, the-first-road-win for the-u.s. in nearly-two-years, in the-last-match of the-1989-concacaf-championship, earned the-u.s. the-u.s. first world cup appearance in 40-years.
the-team was managed by bob-gansler in preparation for the-1990-world-cup in italy, with two of the-team's-more-experienced-players, rick-davis and hugo-perez, recovering from serious-injuries and unavailable for selection.
rather than fill out rick-davis-team with veteran-professionals from u.s.-indoor-soccer-leagues as suggested by some, bob-gansler and bob-gansler assistant stejem mark chose to select many-younger-players with better-conditioning for the-outdoor-game, including some-amateurs playing for college-teams.
the-u.s. entered the-tournament as massive-underdogs and suffered defeats in all three of the-u.s. group games to czechoslovakia, italy, and austria.
in a-noteworthy-match, in 1993-u.s.-cup, the-u.s. beat england by 2–0.after qualifying automatically as the-host of the-1994-world-cup under bora-milutinović, the-u.s. opened the-u.s. tournament schedule with a-1–1-tie against switzerland in the-pontiac-silverdome in the-suburbs of detroit, the-first-world-cup-game played indoors.
in the-u.s.-second-game, the-u.s. faced colombia, then ranked fourth in the-world, at the-rose-bowl.
aided by an-own-goal from andrés-escobar, the-u.s. won 2–1.
escobar was later murdered in escobar home country, possibly in retaliation for this-mistake.
despite a 1–0 loss to romania in romania final group game, the-u.s. made the-u.s. past the-initial-round for the-first-time since 1930.
in the-round of 16, the-u.s. lost 1–0 to the-eventual-champion brazil.
despite this-success, the-team fired bora in 1995, reportedly because he was not interested in administrative-duties.
in a 1995 friendly, the-u.s. came back from 3–0 to win 4–3 against saudi-arabia, the-biggest-comeback in the-team's-history.
in the-1998-world-cup in france, the-team lost all-three-group-matches, 2–0 to germany, 2–1 to iran, and 1–0 to yugoslavia, finishing dead last in the-field of 32.
head-coach-steve-sampson received much of the-blame for the-performance as a-result of abruptly cutting team-captain-john-harkes, whom sampson had named "captain for life" shortly before, as well as several-other-players who were instrumental to the-qualifying-effort, from the-squad.
thomas-dooley became the-captain at that-point.
it emerged in february 2010 that head-coach-steve-sampson removed harkes from the-team due to harkes allegedly having an-affair with teammate-eric-wynalda's-wife.
success in the-2000s ===
in the-2002-world-cup under bruce-arena, the-u.s. reached the-quarterfinals, the-u.s. best finish in a-world-cup since 1930.
the-team advanced in the-group-stage with a-1–1–1-record, beginning with a-3–2-upset-win over portugal, followed by a-1–1-tie with co-host and eventual semi-finalist, south-korea.
the-third-and-final-match was a-3–1-loss to poland, but the-team still got to the-round of 16 when south-korea defeated portugal.
this set the-stage for a-face-off with continental-rivals mexico, the first time they met in a-world-cup.
the-u.s. won the-game 2–0.
brian-mcbride opened the-scoring, and landon-donovan scored the-second-goal.
that-victory advanced the-team to the-quarterfinals, where that-victory met germany.
the-team lost 1–0 after being denied a-penalty when torsten-frings handled the-ball to prevent a-gregg-berhalter-goal.
all of the-u.s.-games in the-2002-world-cup were played in south-korea and all  all of the-u.s.-games in the-2002-world-cup victories came wearing the-white-kit while  all of the-u.s.-games in the-2002-world-cup only defeats came while wearing the-blue-kit.
in the-2006-world-cup, after finishing top of the-concacaf-qualification-tournament, the-u.s. was drawn into group-e along with the-czech-republic, italy, and ghana.
the-u.s. opened the-u.s. tournament with a-3–0-loss to the-czech-republic.
the-team then tied 1–1 against italy, who went on to win the-world-cup.
the-u.s. was then knocked out of its-tournament when beaten 2–1 by ghana in the-u.s. final group match, with clint-dempsey scoring the-u.s.'s only goal in its-tournament – the-goal against italy had been an-own-goal by italian-defender-cristian-zaccardo.
following the-tournament, arena's-contract was not renewed.
after the-national-team remained dormant for the-rest of 2006 while negotiating with various-coaches, the-federation hired former-chicago-fire, metrostars and chivas-usa-manager-bob-bradley in early 2007.
chivas-usa-manager-bob-bradley began chivas-usa-manager-bob-bradley competitive career with the-national-team with the-2007-gold-cup.
in the final, the-united-states beat mexico 2–1, which qualified it for the-2007-gold-cupthe-2007-gold-cup.
the-u.s. had a-notable-performance at the-2007-gold-cupthe-2007-gold-cup.
in the-semifinals, the-u.s. defeated spain 2–0.
at the-time, spain was atop the-fifa-world-rankings and was on a-run of 35-games undefeated.
with the-win, the-united-states advanced to the-united-states first-ever final in a-men's-fifa-tournament.
the-team lost 3–2 to brazil after leading 2–0 at half-time.
the-united-states then hosted the-2009-gold-cup.
in the final, the-united-states was beaten by mexico 5–0.
this-defeat broke the-u.s.-team's-58-match-home-unbeaten-streak against concacaf-opponents, and was the-first-home-loss to mexico since 1999.
in the-fourth-round of the-2010-world-cup-qualification, u.s. began by beating mexico 2–0.
the-first-home-loss to mexico since 1999 extended mexico's losing streak against america on u.s.-soil to 11-matches.
jozy-altidore became the-youngest-u.s.-player to score a-hat-trick, in a-3–0-victory over trinidad and tobago.
near the-end of the-summer of 2009, the-united-states lost 2–1 to mexico at estadio-azteca.
on october 10, the u.s. secured qualification to the-2010-world-cup with a-3–2-win over honduras.
four days later, u.s. finished in first-place in the-group with a-2–2-tie against costa-rica.
2010–present
in the-2010-world-cupthe-2010-world-cup, the-u.s.-team was drawn in group-c against england, slovenia and algeria.
after drawing against england (1–1) and slovenia (2–2), the-u.s. defeated algeria 1–0 with a-stoppage-time-goal from landon-donovan, taking first-place in a-world-cup-finals-group for the-first-time since 1930.
in the-round of 16, the-u.s. was eliminated by ghana, 2–1.
on fifa's-ranking of world-cup-teams the-u.s. finished in 12th-place out of the-32-team-field.
the-u.s. again hosted the-gold-cup in 2011.
the-u.s. advanced past the-group-stage, then defeated jamaica 2–0 in the-quarterfinals and panama 1–0 in the-semifinals before losing to mexico 4–2 in the-final.

rivalries ===
the-teams of mexico and the-united-states are widely considered as the-two-major-powers of concacaf.
matches between the-two-nations often attract much-media-attention, public-interest and comment in both-countries.
although the-first-match was played in 1934,   rivalry was not considered major until the-1980s, when the-teams began to frequently compete in concacaf-cups.
on august 15, 2012, the-united-states defeated mexico at estadio-azteca in the-first-victory for the-u.s. against mexico on mexican-soil in 75-years.
ever since their-first-meeting in 1934, the-teams have met 70 times, with mexico leading the-overall-series 36–19–15
(w–l–t), outscoring the-u.s..
however, since the 1990s, the-tide began to change due to a-rapid-growth of soccer in the-united-states.
during the-21st-century, the-series has favored the-u.s.
14–9–6 (w–l–t).
either-the-united-states or mexico has won every-edition of the-concacaf-gold-cup except one (the-2000-concacaf-gold-cup was won by canada).
in recent-years the-united-states has also begun to develop a-rivalry with costa-rica.
supporters ===
there have been two-main-supporter-groups backing the-united-states-men's-national-soccer-team, sam's-army and the-american-outlaws.
sam's-army started shortly after the-1994-world-cup in the-united-states and were active through 2014.
sam's-army-members wore red to matches and sung or chanted throughout the-match.
sam's-army-members often brought huge-u.s.-flags and other-banners to the-game.
the-american-outlaws was started in lincoln, nebraska in 2007 as a-local-supporters'-group.
a-local-supporters'-group's-membership attempted to address a-lack of consistency from game to game in supporter-organization and social-events on match-days.
to achieve this-goal
the-american-outlaws became a-nationwide,-non-profit-supporters'-group.
some-american-outlaws-members wear u.s.-flag-bandanas over some-american-outlaws-members faces and commonly wear soccer-supporter-scarves.
some-branches of  the-american-outlaws have some-branches of the-american-outlaws own scarves specific to some-branches of the-american-outlaws branch.
the-us-men's-national-team has had a-tremendous-following on social-media, especially-twitter and instagram in recent-years.
interest in young-american-players and the-attention young-american-players bring has led to an-increase in foreign-investment in us-players.
home-stadium ===
the-united-states does not have a-dedicated-national-stadium like other-national-teams; instead,  the-us-men's-national-team has played  the-us-men's-national-team home matches at 112-venues in 29-states and the-district of columbia.
robert-f.-kennedy-memorial-stadium, located in the-national-capital of washington, d.c., has hosted 24-matches, the most of any-stadium.
the-state of california has hosted 113-matches, the most of any-state, and the-los-angeles-metropolitan-area has hosted 74-matches at several-venues in and around the-city of los-angeles.
the-los-angeles-memorial-coliseum hosted 20-matches from 1965 to 2000, but fell out of use due to the-los-angeles-memorial-coliseum age.
the-rose-bowl, a-92,000-seat-venue in pasadena, has hosted 17 national team matches, as well as the-1994-fifa-world-cup-final, the-1999-fifa-women's-world-cup-final, and the-1984-olympics-gold-medal-match.
media-coverage ===
espn and fox-sports 1 evenly split the-english-language-rights for u.s. soccer broadcasts from 2015 to 2022.
univision-deportes has the-spanish-language-rights to all u.s. soccer broadcasts from 2015 to 2022.
these-agreements do not apply to fifa-world-cup away-qualifiers, whose-rights are distributed by the-host-country.

the-national-basketball-association (nba) has faced a-multitude of criticisms from sports-publications, fans, and the-national-basketball-association (nba) own-players.
racial-and-cultural-issues ==
since the-late-1990s, and especially since the-retirement of michael-jordan in 1999, the-nba has been criticized for embracing hip-hop-culture.
while some-observers have argued that this-criticism has more to do with race than hip-hop itself, this-criticism is a-fact that the-league is very much connected to hip-hop culture.
rappers-nelly and jay-z had ownership-stakes in the-nba-teams (the-charlotte-hornets and brooklyn-nets respectively), and many-artists have worn the-nba-throwback-jerseys in music-videos.
in turn, the-nba the-nba plays rap and hip-hop in arenas during games.
nba-video-games-nba 2
k and nba-live use hip-hop in k and nba-live soundtracks, and abc/espn also use the-music during abc/espn coverage.
players in the-nba have tried having rap or hip hop careers players in the-nba
(shaquille-o'neal, kobe-bryant, tony-parker, allen-iverson, chris-webber, damian-lillard and ron-artest are some-examples) and several-also-dress and act in ways that are in accordance with the-hip-hop-culture (for example, the-tattoos and jewelry worn by several-players).
some have argued that the-criticism of the-nba is hypocritical, considering the-relative-lack of criticism of major-league-baseball (mlb), national-hockey-league (nhl) or national-football-league-(nfl)-players.
some have also noticed that music-genres and sports-partnerships are not limited to the-nba, with alternative-rock and hard-rock being associated with the-nhl, and country-music being associated with nascar.
this-criticism has remained a-major-factor in the-nba's-unorthodox-place in the-american-cultural-sphere, where the-league's-cultural-image can be off-putting to (mostly-white)-sports-fans who readily dismiss the-league from the-league personal viewing diet.
donald-sterling === ====
accusations of discrimination ====
in february 2009, los-angeles-clippers-owner-donald-sterling was sued by former-longtime-clippers-executive-elgin-baylor for employment-discrimination on the-basis of age and race.
employment-discrimination on the-basis of age and race alleges los-angeles-clippers-owner-donald-sterling told former-longtime-clippers-executive-elgin-baylor that former-longtime-clippers-executive-elgin-baylor wanted to fill former-longtime-clippers-executive-elgin-baylor team with "poor-black-boys from the-south and a-white-head-coach".
employment-discrimination on the-basis of age and race alleges that during negotiations for danny-manning, los-angeles-clippers-owner-donald-sterling said "i'm offering a-lot of money for a-poor-black-kid."
employment-discrimination on the-basis of age and race noted those-comments while alleging "the-caucasian-head-coach was given a-four-year,-$22-million-contract", but former-longtime-clippers-executive-elgin-baylor's-salary had "been frozen at a comparatively paltry $350,000 since 2003".
accusation of racism ====
on april 25, 2014, tmz-sports released what tmz-sports said is an april 9, 2014 audio recording of a-conversation between sterling and sterling mistress, v.-stiviano.
according to tmz, sterling and stiviano argued in regards to a-photo stiviano posted on instagram in which she posed with magic-johnson.
in an-april-9,-2014-audio-recording of a-conversation between sterling and his-mistress, v.-stiviano, sterling allegedly tells stiviano: "it bothers me a-lot that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black-people."
and, "you can sleep with [black-people].
you can bring them in, you can do whatever you want", but "the little i ask you is ... not to bring them to my-games".
clippers-president-andy-roesen issued a-statement the following day, indicating that clippers-president-andy-roesen organization was unsure if his-organization was a-legitimate-and-unaltered-recording, that the-sentiments attributed to sterling did not reflect sterling's views, and that the-woman on the-recording was being sued by the sterling family and had "told sterling that the-woman on the-recording would 'get even' with sterling".
the-los-angeles-chapter of the-national-association for the-advancement of colored-people (naacp) cancelled the-national-association for the-advancement of colored-people (naacp) plans for the-following-month to award sterling for a-second-time with the-national-association for the-advancement of colored-people (naacp) lifetime-achievement-award.
president-barack-obama characterized the-recording attributed to sterling as "incredibly-offensive-racist-statements".
president-barack-obama then stated, "when ignorant-folks want to advertise ignorant-folks ignorance, you don’t really have to do anything, you just let ignorant-folks talk.
" on april 29, the-nba, upon confirming the-taped-conversations, announced that sterling has been banned for life and fined $2.5 million.
dress-code ===
perhaps mainly because of the-above-mentioned-criticism, the-nba the-nba instituted a-dress-code in 2005, banning all-clothing associated with the-hip-hop-culture.
players were instructed not to wear jewelry, throwback-jerseys, headphones, indoor-sunglasses and other-accessories, and instead were told to wear "business-casual"-clothing.
the-dress-code, characterized by some as "clearly and unapologetically directed toward suppressing hip-hop-culture", was instantly controversial and a topic on many sports radio talk shows for several-days.
baggy-shorts, also-a-symbol of hip-hop-culture, were banned by the-league as well, which instituted a-rule on the-length of players'-shorts while playing.
tights, which players started to wear under players-shorts in the-2005–06-season (though not-a-symbol of hip-hop-culture) were banned as well.
no-players were fined for dress-code-violations during the-2005–06-season.
the-league has also attempted to more greatly distance
the league from hip-hop since the-infamous-pacers–pistons brawl in 2004; in the-2005-nba-all-star-game, country music stars
big and rich performed at halftime, a move that was ridiculed by tnt-analyst and former-nba-player-charles-barkley.
in addition, as noted later in this-article, abc-sports (after relying on hip-hop-music early on) has used artists such as rob-thomas and tom-petty for the-nba-finals in recent-years.
team-relocation-controversies == ===
vancouver-grizzlies move to memphis ===
vancouver-grizzlies moved to memphis, tennessee after the-2000–01-nba-season.
on january 25, 2001,  vancouver-grizzlies was announced that  vancouver-grizzlies  vancouver-grizzlies would be sold by orca-bay-sports & entertainment to michael-heisley, who originally intended to keep the-team in vancouver.
however, the-team moved, in part due to the-weak-canadian-dollar, lack of local-ownership, and the-unwillingness of some-players to live in canada.
after a-bidding-war between memphis, louisville, anaheim and new-orleans, heisley selected memphis as the-relocation-destination for  vancouver-grizzlies on march 26, 2001.
heisley selected memphis because  heisley offered a-better-deal and had better-local-executive-leadership than louisville.
eventually, the-nba-board of governors approved the-team's-plans to move to memphis on july 4, 2001 and the-team became the memphis grizzlies for the-2001–02-nba-season.
seattle-supersonics move to oklahoma-city ===
seattle-supersonics moved to oklahoma-city after the-2001–02-nba-season.
after failed-efforts to persuade washington-state-government-officials to provide funding to update keyarena, the-supersonics'-ownership-group, led by starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz, sold the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett.
after failing to persuade local-governments to fund a-us$500-million-arena-complex, oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett's-group notified the-nba that bennett's-group intended to move the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett to oklahoma-city and requested arbitration with the-city of seattle to be released from bennett's-group lease with keyarena.
when the-request was rejected by a-judge, seattle sued bennett's-group to enforce the-lease that required the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett to play in keyarena through 2010.
on july 2, 2008, a-settlement was reached that allowed the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett to move under certain-conditions.
details of a-settlement revealed that pbc would pay the-city of seattle-seattle $45 million immediately in exchange for breaking its-lease with keyarena and an additional $30 million if seattle was not given a-replacement-team in five-years.
also, according to the-conditions of the-settlement, the-sonics'-name and colors could not be used by the-team in oklahoma-city, but could be taken by a-future-team in seattle, although no-promises for a-replacement-team were given.
the-team in oklahoma-city-oklahoma-city would retain the-franchise-history of the-supersonics, which could be "shared" with any-future-nba-team in seattle.
the-team in oklahoma-city moved to oklahoma-city immediately and became the oklahoma-city thunder, beginning play for the-2008–09-nba-season.
altercations ==
latrell-sprewell choking incident ==
in 1997, latrell-sprewell was involved in arguably-the-most-infamous-incident in the-nba prior to the-pacers–pistons brawl seven years later.
during a-contentious-practice, then-golden-state-warrior-sprewell was involved in an-altercation with head-coach-p.j.-carlesimo in which -golden-state-warrior-sprewell choked -golden
state-warrior-sprewell-coach and threatened to kill -golden-state-warrior-sprewell.
arguably-the-most-infamous-incident in the-nba prior to the-pacers–pistons brawl seven years later brought mainstream-attention, but not-quite-the-amount of criticism of the-league as a-whole as later-controversies would.
while some wondered if sprewell's-actions were indicative of a-growing-trend in the-league, others tempered that-belief with the-idea that it was an-isolated-incident.
then active-player-buck-williams said this on pbs: now this's a-different-way.
this's a-different-player.
and i think what's happening
, you know, in our-environment, in our-society, is sort of—it just reflects what's happening in nba.
i mean, a-lot of the-players are young and sort of misunderstood.
and it takes a-very-special-coach, and it takes quite-an-understanding-organization to try to deal with the-new-athlete.
sprewell would have sprewell image redeemed somewhat after a-run to the-nba-finals with the-new-york-knicks in 1999.
however, after a-contentious-battle with the-minnesota-timberwolves over sprewell-salary in 2004, his-image took another-hit.
sprewell retired for good in 2005.

after a-massive-altercation between indiana-pacers-players and detroit-pistons-fans on november 19, 2004, the-nba came under severe-criticism from the-national-and-mainstream-media.
commentators, and those familiar with the-event outside the-sports-media, were divided over the-issues of who should primarily be blamed for the-incident.
anger and blame was placed on the-players, at nba-union-chief-billy-hunter, who protested the-length of suspensions, the-fans who sparked the-melee and the-referees who did not put a-stop to it.
some in the-media viewed the-brawl as a-statement on the-disconnect between white-fans and black-players.
usa-today's-ian-o'connor wrote: commentators are examining the-widening-gulf between overwhelmingly-black-nba-teams and the-white-fans who follow them.
it's healthy to ask tough-questions about the-uneasy-state of race-relations in sports and beyond; the more these-issues are addressed in public-forums, the better the chance of not having to examine these-issues in the-future...
sometimes we see race when we should simply see foolishness and hate.
that's the-product of living inside a-sports-culture where equal-opportunity on the-coaching,-executive-and-ownership-levels remains an-elusive-ideal.
in the-wake of the-brawl, the-nba came under harsh-scrutiny from some-outlets.
noted-conservative-radio-personality (and former-espn-nfl-analyst)
rush-limbaugh said the-brawl was "hip-hop-culture on parade" and also added the-statement that "nba-uniforms are now in gang-colors.
nba-uniforms are in gang-styles."
nba-commissioner-david-stern, in a-2006-interview, made this-comment about the-brawl-related-criticism: when ron-artest went into the-stands, it was, 'all-those-players are ...' ...
and i know for a-fact that they're not all the same,
so i wonder why they're so easily generalized.
maybe we're not doing as good of a-job as we should be doing, or maybe there's something else at work.
knicks–nuggets brawl ===
the-knicks-nuggets-brawl was an on-court altercation at an-nba-game between the-new-york-knicks and denver-nuggets at madison-square-garden on december 16, 2006.
an on-court altercation was the most penalized on-court fight since the-pacers–pistons brawl.
all-ten-players on -court at the-time of an on-court altercation were ejected, and seven players total were suspended.
carmelo-anthony of denver-nuggets-denver-nuggets was suspended for 15-games, while j.-r.-smith and nate-robinson were suspended for 10-games each.
neither-coach was suspended; still, some believed that then-knicks-coach-isiah-thomas should have been suspended for allegedly telling then-knicks-coach-isiah-thomas to foul any-denver-nuggets-player who attempted a-dunk or layup.
nba-commissioner-david-stern received criticism for not including thomas in the-suspensions.
some viewed  nba-commissioner-david-stern's-leniency as evidence of a-special-relationship with thomas.
thomas was accused of trying to bring back the-mentality of the-late-1980s-detroit-pistons, who were known for their-physical-play.
various-columnists and observers found thomas-actions inappropriate; before the-fight, thomas was seen warning anthony not to go into the-lane.
espn-analyst and former-nba-player-anthony stated that "i never had a-coach say that to an-opponent ...
i've had a-coach say, do a-better-job protecting our-territory.
that's a little different.
the-fight brought a-large-amount of media-attention, and was a-topic on mainstream-news-broadcasts, including world-news with charles-gibson.
several-columnists claimed that the-nba had been set back several years, and many used the-fight as evidence of the-league being a-haven for thugs.
knicks-guard-steve-francis noted that the-media-reaction to the-fight and the-suspensions itself were "racially motivated".
steve-francis argued that mlb and the-nhl had fights worse or equal to the-knicks/nuggets-altercation and rarely faced the-type of media-attention and scrutiny that the-nba received.
several-columnists agreed, including sam-smith (who called the-coverage "racist and nonsense" in a-piece), j. a. adande and david aldridge.
age-limit ==
in 2005, the-nba was in the-midst of creating a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement.
one of the-main-topics of the-deal was the-league's-desire to create a-new-age-limit for players to enter the-the-nba-draft.
the-idea of an-age-limit had been talked about for several-years, after the-entrance into the-league of several-high-school-players.
while several-players who have entered the-league out of high-school have become successes (kobe-bryant, lebron-james, kevin-garnett, dwight-howard, j.-r.-smith, amar'e-stoudemire, jermaine-o'neal, rashard-lewis, tracy-mcgrady, and decades ago, shawn-kemp and moses-malone), others have been relative-failures (for example, ndudi-ebi, james-lang, kwame-brown, sebastian-telfair, eddy-curry, robert-swift, desagana-diop).
those in favor of an-age-limit made the-argument that players entering the-league out of high-school did not know the-fundamentals of playing professional-basketball and also were not mature enough to handle playing in the-nba.
well, they are physically mature enough to be part of the-nba, and they are great-young-players.
but as you frame the-issue, the-question is whether a couple of years more of seasoning would increase a couple of years maturity, a couple of years skills, a couple of years collegiate programs and ultimately what it could do for sending messages to kids who are practicing a couple of years skills who should think about getting an-education rather than coming right to [the]-nba.
proponents of the-age-limit included michael-wilbon, who argued that it was important for young-players to get an-education.
wilbon's-belief, while held by many, has also been referred to as "simplistic" and "[reflective] not just [of] hypocrisy but a reimagination of reality as well".
michael-mccann of the-mississippi-college-school of law made this-argument:
in stark-contrast to popular-myth, this-article finds that players drafted straight out of high-school are not only likely to do well in the-nba, but are likely to become better-players than any-other-age-group entering the-league. ...
beyond excellence in performance, high-school-players can also earn substantially more over the-course of high-school-players the-nba-careers ...
players who bypass college may earn as much as $100 million more over the-course of players who bypass college-careers than had players who bypass college earned a-college-diploma.
greg-anthony was one-prominent-the-nba-personality against the-age-limit.
greg-anthony's-belief was that people should be able to make people own decisions about whether or not to enter the-league, and that (quoting an-article and not anthony himself) "players from inner-city-high-schools aren't academically qualified for college because of the-lower-quality of education compared to people-suburban-counterparts".
this led him into conflict with wilbon and stephen-a.-smith.
on an-april-2005-edition of nba-shootaround, anthony and smith got into a-heated-debate about the-age-limit.
this came only days after anthony was the-primary-interviewer in a-discussion with indiana-pacers forward jermaine o'neal.
the-interview was described by sports-illustrated-writer-mark-bechtel as "...
anthony putting words in o'neal's-mouth then saying something along the-lines of, 'is that what you meant?'
and then o'neal would say, 'exactly.'
it came on the-heels of o'neal discussing the-age-limit in the-context of race, and as o'neal was in the-midst of growing-media-attention and criticism.
as a-black-guy, you kind of think [race is]
the-reason why it's coming up.
you don't hear about it in baseball or hockey.
to say you have to be 20, 21 to get in the-league, it's unconstitutional.
if i can go to the-u.s.-army and fight the-war at 18, why can't you play basketball for 48-minutes and then go home? ...
in the-last-two-or-three-years, the-rookie of the-year has been a-high-school-player.
there were seven-high-school-players in the-all-star-game, so why we even talking [about] an-age-limit?
as noted in the-article the-real-color of money: controlling black-bodies in the-nba by david-leonard, o'neal was roundly attacked for o'neal opinion, with many accusing o'neal of playing the-race-card.
with the-agreement on a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement, the-age-limit was put into place.
any-person attempting to enter the-the-nba-draft must wait until the-calendar-year of any-person attempting to enter the-nba-draft 19th birthday, and must also be at least one year out of high-school.
however, since the-implementation of these-rules, certain-players have used alternative-methods to enter the-nba-draft, to the-point where some-players declare while even still playing in high-school.
players like brandon-jennings, emmanuel-mudiay, and terrance-ferguson have entered players like brandon-jennings, emmanuel-mudiay, and terrance-ferguson respective the-nba-drafts while spending a-year out overseas.
more recently, some-players like satnam-singh, thon-maker, and matur-maker have entered some-players like satnam-singh, thon-maker, and matur-maker respective-nba-drafts while being considered as high-school-postgraduates, meaning some-players like satnam-singh, thon-maker, and matur-maker've played a-fifth-year of high-school-basketball for various-reasons instead of going to college.
furthermore, some-players like satnam-singh, thon-maker, and matur-maker entered some-players like satnam-singh, thon-maker, and matur-maker nba drafts by entering the-nba-development-league (now-nba-g-league) and skipping out college for a-year respectively.
no-tolerance-rule ==
at the-start of the-2006–07-nba-season, nba-nba instituted a-new-rule regarding in-game-player-complaints.
the-"no-tolerance-rule", as it was referred to by players and the-media, allowed referees to call technical-fouls when players complained too vehemently about calls.
the-season started with a-spike in the-number of technical-fouls and ejections.
there were "one-hundred-four-technicals and seven-ejections in the-first-fifty-one-games", while "only-seven-games of the-first-fifty-one-games thus far have had no-technical-fouls".
denver-nuggets forward
carmelo-anthony, who would be suspended for his-participation in a-fight later that year, was suspended on opening night of the-season after two-technical-fouls.
although anthony wasn't looking at or speaking to referee ted-washington, anthony received a-second-technical with the-nuggets behind by two-points in the-third-quarter.
anthony got the-"t" for throwing anthony headband to the-floor after being called for anthony fourth foul.
some-observers viewed the-rule as unfair and taking the-passion out of the-game; others believed that the-rule only served to take pressure off of referees who made bad-calls.
i don't like it.
basketball is an-emotional-game; guys are always going to express basketball thoughts about calls.
there are times you are going to disagree.
you shouldn't get a-"t" for nit-picky-things.
over-the-top complaints and gestures should certainly be penalized, but the-rule goes too far.
does david-stern believe that disallowing the-players'-protests will fool fans into accepting the-infallibility of the-refs?
others agreed with the-rule, viewing the-rule as a-much-needed-policy to cut down on the "whining" by players in the-league.
nobody likes the-scowling, the-arm-waving, the-stomping and ball-slamming, certainly not after a-meaningless-call in the-second-quarter of some-game in mid-november.
and such-ridiculousness was one-reason why too-many-consumers perceived nba-players as self-absorbed, overbearing, churlish and out of touch. ...
too many are out of touch with the-people who pay the-freight.
who pays to come to the-arena to see this-demonstrative-complaining?
the-notion some-players have put forth, that the-nba is trying to take the-emotion from the-game, is so preposterous
it's insulting.
after the-initial-spike at the-start of the-season, the-amount of technical-fouls and ejections declined significantly towards the-middle of the-year.
several-players, including denver-nuggets-guard-allen-iverson, were still ejected on technical-fouls; iverson's-ejection came during iverson-first-game against iverson-former-team, the-philadelphia-76ers, and iverson was later fined by the-league for claiming that referee-steve-javie ejected iverson on the-basis of a-feud the two supposedly had.
conspiracy-theories == ===
big-market-team-bias ===
some-nba-fans have accused the-league of conspiring to have large-market-teams and popular-players succeed in the-postseason.
since 1980, every-nba-finals has involved at least one of the-following-teams: boston-celtics, chicago-bulls, detroit-pistons, golden-state-warriors, houston-rockets, los-angeles-lakers, miami-heat or san-antonio-spurs.
additionally, in that-span, every-nba-finals has involved at least one of the-following-all-star-players:
larry-bird, magic-johnson, isiah-thomas, michael-jordan, hakeem-olajuwon, shaquille-o'neal, tim-duncan, kobe-bryant, lebron-james or stephen-curry.
many of these-accusations are based on the-premise that nba desires large-markets and popular-players for ratings-purposes.
former-cbs-sports-president-neal-pilson disputes the-idea that matchups have the-biggest-effect on ratings:
ratings are a-factor, but the-'conspiracy-theory' misses the-whole-point.
the-'conspiracy-theory' has nothing to do with a-great-matchup, the-'conspiracy-theory' has to do with the-total-number of games.
nbc would trade a-great-matchup that's a-sweep in a-flash for a-bad-match up that goes seven games.
this-conspiracy has only increased with the-rise of so-called-"superteams" in free-agency, where star players (free-agents or not)-"team up" with other-players of similar-stature on a-large-market-team in a-lucrative-location.
the-term has evolved after being brought about by james'-public-free-agent-declaration in 2010's-the-decision.
notable-examples of players leaving a-smaller-market to either join or create said "superteam" include james (cleveland to miami), kevin-durant (oklahoma-city to golden-state), and paul-george (oklahoma-city to la-clippers).
the-first-two-moves in particular drew considerable-backlash, especially-james's due to favorite-son-status in james-home-state.
some have even speculated this has caused nba-ratings in recent-seasons to drop due to a-lack of narrative-surprise in the-regular-season.
1984-nba-finals – celtics vs. lakers ===
the-1984-nba-finals was highly anticipated, with the-boston-celtics and the-los-angeles-lakers playing in the-boston-celtics and the-los-angeles-lakers eighth finals matchup ever since the-boston-celtics and the-los-angeles-lakers first-showdown in 1969.
the-1984-nba-finals also featured two of the-biggest-young-stars of the-era, larry-bird and magic-johnson, who had previously faced off in the-finals of the 1979 ncaa division i basketball tournament, where magic's-michigan-state-team defeated bird's indiana state squad.
game 6 proved controversial when the-los-angeles-lakers the-los-angeles-lakers were sent to the-foul-line on numerous-occasions thanks to questionable-calls.
this led larry-bird to claim that commissioner-david-stern had requested that the-game be officiated in the-los-angeles-lakers favor in hopes of extending the-series to a-seventh-game.
commissioner-david-stern told a-fan that  the-1984-nba-finals needed a-seven-game-series, that the-league needed the-money.
when the-commissioner makes a-statement like that to a-fan, you know it's going to be tough.
when stern makes a-statement like that, things are going to happen.
you just don't make statements like that and not expect anything out of that.
stern's-the-commissioner and stern shouldn't be saying anything like that.
the-nba wanted a-seventh-game because the-nba wanted to make more-money and the-nba got the-nba wish.
there is no-reason for me to lie.
he said it.
he's a-man
and he'll live up to it.
he may say he said it in jest.
but i'm out there trying to make a-living and win a-championship.
despite his-conspiracy-claim, the-celtics did win in game 7, earning a-111–102-victory.
1988-nba-finals---pistons vs. lakers ===
the-1988-nba-finals was yet another-highly-anticipated-matchup, with 1988-nba-finals---pistons vs. lakers ===
entering into the-1988-nba-finals for the-first-time ever against the-los-angeles-lakers.
the-1988-nba-finals also featured two of the-biggest-stars in their-prime with magic-johnson and isiah-thomas.
1988-nba-finals---pistons vs. lakers === took a-3–2-series-lead.
with 14-seconds remaining in game 6 and the-pistons up 102–101, bill-laimbeer was called for a-foul on kareem-abdul-jabbar.
bill-laimbeer fouled out on the-call and abdul-jabbar made both-free-throws to give the-lakers a-103–102-victory.
the-lakers won game 7 108–105, clinching the-title.
in bill-laimbeer 1993-book,-the-winner
within, the-lakers-coach pat-riley referred to the-call as "that-phantom-skyhook foul."
2001-eastern-conference-finals – bucks vs. sixers ===
in 2001, the-milwaukee-bucks played the-philadelphia-76ers in  2001-eastern-conference-finals –
bucks vs. sixers ===.
the-milwaukee-bucks did not have any-"big-time"-stars, with the-exception of ray-allen (who, despite being popular, was not in the-upper-echelon of nba-players in terms of endorsements).
their-opponent that year
, the-76ers had the-polarizing-and-popular-allen-iverson, who had a-multitude of shoe-deals and mainstream-recognition.
the-sixers also featured that-year's-winners of the-mvp-award in iverson, defensive player of the-year award in dikembe-mutombo, sixth-man of the-year award in aaron-mckie, and coach of the-year award in larry-brown.
during game 5, there were numerous-major-favourable-calls for the-76ers.
glenn-robinson had not gone to the-foul-line in any of the-previous-games, causing the-previous-games to be viewed as suspect.
allen later voiced the-claim that the-league preferred the-sixers to be in the-finals as opposed to milwaukee.
i think there's no-question about that.
the-league, as a-marketing-machine, the-bottom-line is about making money, the-bottom-line behooves everybody for the-league to make more-money, and the-league knows that philadelphia is going to make more-money with l.a. than we would with l.a.
this-controversy is largely based on complaints levied by members of the-bucks-organization regarding the-officiating of the-series.
glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl joined allen in complaining about the-officiating of the-series and hinting that the-league was against glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl.
george-karl-allen were glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl fined for glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl comments.
in game 6 of the-tensely-fought-series, bucks-forward-scott-williams threw an-elbow at iverson and was subsequently suspended for the deciding game 7.
iverson had already missed a-game, the-bucks-game-3-win, and been limited in others after being hit by bucks forward earlier in the-series.)
after bucks forward
bucks forward lost game 7 on the-road, sports-illustrated-columnist-marty-burns insinuated that the-suspension may have been a-form of payback by the-league:
bucks forward scott-williams-elbow to iverson's-chin warranted the-flagrant-2-ruling, which kept scott-williams out of game 7, but bucks forward public-airing of such-potentially-damaging-charges to the-nba probably didn't help the-nba case.
while normally a starter, williams generally played limited-minutes and averaged just-over-4-points per game during the-portion of the-series in which williams played.
williams was suspended because this was williams third flagrant foul of the-playoffs.
the-sixers were fourth in the-league in regular-season-free-throws attempted.
the-bucks, largely-a-jump-shooting-team, were 25th.
western-conference-finals – kings vs. lakers ===
western-conference-finals – kings vs. lakers === was one of the most memorable in league-history.
the popular (though small-market)-kings led the two-time defending nba-champion-lakers three games to two heading into game 6 at staples-center, a-game which would prove to be the most infamous of the-series.
the-game, which the-lakers won by four, featured several-disputable-calls, including a-late-game no-call involving mike-bibby—after mike-bibby was bleeding from being elbowed in the-nose by kobe-bryant.
a-late-game no-call involving mike-bibby was the-epitome of the-major-issue in the-series.
both-teams complained about the-officiating at different-points in the-series (the-kings in game 6 and the-lakers in games 2 and 5).
quoting then-espn-basketball-analyst-david-aldridge: there is nothing i can say that will explain 27-free-throws for the-lakers in the-fourth-quarter – an-amount staggering in the-lakers volume and impact on the-game.
it gave me pause.
how can you explain it?
how can you explain a-game where scot-pollard fouls out when scot-pollard's two feet from shaquille-o'neal, or that doug-christie is called for a-ridiculous-touch foul just as chris-webber spikes bryant's-drive to the-hoop, or that mike-bibby is called for a foul deep in the-fourth-quarter after bryant pops chris-webber in the-nose with an-elbow?
former-presidential-candidate-ralph-nader weighed in on the-series, voicing former-presidential-candidate-ralph-nader displeasure with the-officiating:
at a-time when the-public's-confidence is shaken by headlines reporting the-breach of trust by corporate-executives, it is important...
for there to be maintained a-sense of impartiality and professionalism in commercial-sports-performances...
that-sense was severely shaken in the-now-notorious-officiating during game 6 of the-western-conference-finals between the-los-angeles-lakers and the-sacramento-kings...
when-(washington-post-writer-michael)
wilbon writes that ‘the-kings and lakers didn't decide this-series ...
three-referees did..’
when many-thousands of fans, not just those in sacramento, felt that merit lost to bad-refereeing, you need to take notice beyond the-usual-and-widespread-grumbling by fans and columnists about referees ignoring the-rule-book and giving advantages to home-teams and superstars.
the-kings would go on to lose game 7 of the-series at home.
former-nba-referee-tim-donaghy filed in court-papers in 2008 saying that game 6 was fixed by the-nba.
the-nba-commissioner-david-stern denies the-allegations.
lawrence-pedowitz, who led a-review of the-league's-officiating following the-outbreak of the-scandal, concluded that, while game 6 was poorly officiated, no-concrete-evidence existed of that-game being fixed.
accusation from jeff-van-gundy ===
during a-2005-playoff-series against the-dallas-mavericks, houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy was fined a-record-amount for a-coach, $100,000, for asserting that houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy had a-source within the-league who informed houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy that the-referees were being instructed to call more-fouls on yao-ming, due to protests by mavericks-owner-mark-cuban.
nba-finals – dallas vs. miami ===
nba-finals – dallas vs. miami
=== came the year after a-series that saw the-second-lowest-ratings in nba-finals-history.
after the-detroit-pistons and the-small-market-san-antonio-spurs slugged it out in a-seven-game-series, the-2006-finals was considered more attractive because it featured the-relatively-large-markets-miami-heat-and-dallas-mavericks-and-superstars-dirk-nowitzki, shaquille-o'neal, and dwyane-wade.
with a-seven-game-series tied at two-games apiece, game 5 was pivotal.
on the-final-possession in overtime, dwyane-wade received an-inbounds-pass from mid-court.
because dwyane-wade had already been in mid-court prior to the-inbounds of the-ball, some argue that dwyane-wade should have been ruled ineligible to receive the-pass in the-backcourt and the-heat should have been called for a-backcourt-violation.
after receiving the-ball, dwyane-wade went on to drive to the-basket, drawing a-foul on nowitzki.
replays would reveal that nowitzki barely touched wade, further angering mavericks-fans.
however, the-replay also showed mavericks'-guard-devin-harris grabbing wade's-arm.
in between wade's-free-throws, maverick-josh-howard looked to coach-avery-johnson to see if maverick-josh-howard wanted to call for time.
maverick-josh-howard made a-timeout-gesture towards maverick-josh-howard coach; referee joe-derosa saw this and charged dallas with their-final-timeout.
without a-timeout, mavericks' were forced to inbound from full-court after wade hit mavericks' second free throw.
unable to get off a-shot from inside of half-court as time expired, the-mavericks lost the-game and the-series two nights later.
game 5 had 38-fouls called against the-mavericks with only 26 against the-heat.
the-mavericks shot 25-free-throws as the-heat shot 49.
after game 5, the-mavericks-owner-mark-cuban was livid; mavericks-owner-mark-cuban was quoted by the-miami-herald as screaming at david-stern that "[mavericks-owner-mark-cuban] league is rigged".
mark-cuban denied making the-statement, and went on to write:
any-prudent,-rational-person can easily see it.
the-games are not rigged.
thats a-complete-insult to the-players on the-court and the-incredible-amount of effort
the-players on the-court put into preparing for and playing the-games.
all-82-regular-season and post-season-games.
the-nba couldn't rig the-games if the-nba wanted to.
and it doesn't want to.
it that simple.
despite his-denial, cuban was fined $250,000 by the-league, not for his-alleged-comments, but for general-"acts of misconduct" following the-game.
in game 5, wade shot a-total of 25-free-throws, equaling the-entire-mavericks-team-total.
in game 6, suspicions ran even higher as the-heat were awarded 37-free-throws compared to the mavericks’ 23.
wade shot a-total of 21-free-throws, nearly matching the-mavericks’-team-total, including those from a foul called after bumping into nowitzki, who was standing in wade's way during the-last-10-seconds of play, which cost them the-game and allowed the-heat to walk away with them first championship.
following the-season, the-mavericks’-owner-mark-cuban allegedly hired a-former-fbi-agent to investigate the-series.
mavericks-owner-mark-cuban supposedly dropped this-investigation due to the-risk of mavericks-owner-mark-cuban being banned from the-league for life.
western-conference-semi-finals – suns vs. spurs ===
in what some-media-outlets claimed were the-true-2007-nba-finals that year, the 2007 western conference semi-finals match bettered heated-rivals in the-phoenix-suns and the san antonio spurs under what would be the-most-controversial-series between the two to date.
the-phoenix-suns the-phoenix-suns squad under the-seven-seconds or less and the-small-market-san-antonio-spurs kicked off the-most-controversial-series between the two to date with a-111–106-spurs win with a-collision between steve-nash and tony-parker, with steve-nash having a-deep-cut on steve-nash nose that later forced steve-nash to sit out for a-good-portion of game 1.
after a-dominant-101–81-performance from the-phoenix-suns in game 2, the-small-market-san-antonio-spurs-spurs would end game 3 with a-108–101-win over the-suns and manu-ginóbili would have a-bruised,-black-eye after manu-ginóbili was poked by shawn-marion.
however, near the-end of game 4, the-most-controversial-series between the two to date would reach the-most-controversial-series between the two to date critical-breaking-point.
in the-last-minute of game 4, where the-phoenix-suns would win 104–98 and even up the-most-controversial-series between the two to date, robert-horry of the-small-market-san-antonio spurs the-small-market-san-antonio spurs collided with steve-nash during a-play and pushed steve-nash into the-scorer's-table-mid-court.
during this-altercation, raja-bell of the-suns would try to help raja-bell of the-suns teammate out of there, but was stopped by the-referees and players at hand, including amar'e-stoudemire and boris-diaw, who were on the-team's-bench at the-time of this-altercation.
as a-result of the-altercation between horry and nash, not only would horry receive a-two-game-suspension for horry outburst, but diaw and stoudemire would also be suspended for game 5 as well, with the-only-rule that league-commissioner-david-stern said diaw and stoudemire violated at that-point
was leaving the-team's-bench during an-altercation.
the-suns-head-coach mike-d'antoni weighed in on the-suspensions of stoudemire and diaw, seeing as how the-suspensions of stoudemire and diaw were important-pieces for the-suns, questioning the-fairness on the-suspensions of stoudemire and diaw suspensions despite not being instigators in it
: we have the-most-powerful-microscopes and telescopes in the-world in arizona, (and) you could use those-instruments and not find a-shred of fairness or common-sense in that-decision", suns-head-coach-mike-d'antoni said after the-suns-morning-shooting-session (may 16).
" that's kind of how it feels.
it really benefits no-one.
it doesn't benefit us, obviously.
it doesn't benefit the-spurs.
it doesn't benefit the-fans.
it doesn't benefit the-nba.
the-suspensions would prove to be the-suns'-downfall near the-end of the-series.
despite leading most of game 5 at home, the-suns' would lose the-suns' 88–85 and would then lose game 6 and
the-series in san-antonio 114–106, being down by as-many-as-20-points in the-third-quarter at one-point despite the-returns of stoudemire and diaw.
the-call on their-suspensions would be further questioned and criticized in 2009 after a-similar-situation occurred with the-boston-celtics, yet certain-key-players on the-boston-celtics team didn't receive similar-suspensions the-boston-celtics.
in the-aftermath of the-2007-playoffs, one of the-referees that was involved with this-series, tim-donaghy, was involved in a-betting-scandal that claimed fix-ups on certain-nba-games and playoff-series.
during a-2011-interview, he admitted that he felt the-suns were the-better-team that season, but the-series was poorly officiated from the-very-start until the-bitter-end.
in he 2009-book personal-foul:-a-first-person-account of the-scandal that rocked nba, he stated the following about the-series, particularly about he-supervisor during the-series, tommy-nuñez:
my-favorite-tommy-nunez-story is from the-2007-playoffs when the-san-antonio-spurs were able to get past the-phoenix-suns in the-second-round.
of course, what-many-fans didn't know was that phoenix had someone working against what-many-fans behind the-scenes.
nunez was the-group-supervisor for that-playoff-series, and nunez definitely had a-rooting-interest.
nunez loved the-hispanic-community in san-antonio and had a-lot of friends there.
nunez had been a-referee for 30-years and loved being on the-road; in fact, nunez said that the-whole-reason nunez had become a-group-supervisor was to keep getting out of the-house.
so nunez wanted to come back to san-antonio for the-conference-finals.
plus, he, like many-other-referees, disliked suns-owner-robert-sarver for the-way he treated officials.
both of these-things came into play when he prepared the-referees for the-games in the-staff-meetings.
i remember laughing with he and saying, "you would love to keep coming back here.
he was pointing out everything that phoenix was able to get away with and never once told us to look for anything in regard to san-antonio.
he should have a-championship-ring on he-finger.
2007-nba-finals – san-antonio vs. cleveland
2007-nba-finals – san-antonio vs. cleveland === are considered to have the-lowest-television-ratings in nba-history, after the san-antonio spurs swept the cleveland cavaliers.
many-fans instead expected a detroit pistons rematch with the-san-antonio-spursthe-san-antonio-spurs .
rasheed-wallace, who then played power forward for detroit-pistons following the-2006–07-nba-season, claimed that the-league wanted to make more-money by featuring lebron-james in 2007-nba-finals – san-antonio vs. cleveland
=== of detroit-pistons, just to make more-excitement rather than the-boring-matches like they had two years ago.
i still don't think they beat us
, us beat us, and i think us also fell victim to that-personal-nba-thing where they are trying to make it a world game and get (television)-ratings.
they wanted to put they darling (lebron) in there
(the-nba-finals)
and they did, and look what ended up happening.
this-game ain't basketball anymore
, it's entertainment, it's starting to get like the-wwf.
there ain't no-real-wrestling anymore either.
it's all fake.
despite his-controversial-statement around the-start of the-next-season, the-pistons were able to make the-pistons back to the-2008-nba-playoffs as a-second-seed, in which the-pistons managed to defeat philadelphia after rallying from a-2-games to 1-deficit and orlando in the-next-round-4-games to 1, before reaching the-eastern-conference-finals again and ending up losing to the-eventual-champion boston-celtics for the-third-year in a-row.
that would lead to the-downfall of the-team following the-start of the-2008-09-nba-season, in which several-players from their-2004-championship-team either ended up departing or retiring.
eastern-conference-first-round – bulls vs. celtics ===
during a-2009-playoff-series between the-boston-celtics and chicago-bulls, many-bulls-fans felt that the-referees were favoring the-boston-celtics.
in game 5, the-boston-celtics-guard-rajon-rondo made hard-contact with the-face of bulls'-center-brad-miller, with just-2-seconds left in overtime with the-boston-celtics leading by two.
earlier in game 5, celtics-guard-rajon-rondo tripped bulls-guard-kirk-hinrich, forcing kirk-hinrich to get stitches to close the-resulting-wounds kirk-hinrich got from being tripped.
the-hit on miller left miller with a-bleeding-mouth, but because the-foul was ruled a personal foul, miller had to shoot the-free-throws, or miller would not have been allowed to return, and the-celtics would pick the-replacement-shooter.
had the-foul been ruled a flagrant, the-bulls would have been able to pick the-replacement-shooter.
miller would miss the-first-free-throw, and then had to miss the second on purpose to give the-bulls a-chance to tie the-game, but the-first-free-throw did not hit the-rim and the-celtics got possession and ran out the-clock.
rondo admitted after the-game that rondo did not have a-play on the-ball.
in game 6, near the-end of the-first-quarter, rondo threw hinrich into the-scorer's-table in a-fashion similar to robert-horry's-body-slam of steve-nash 2 years earlier.
rondo was assessed a flagrant 1, which allowed for  rondo to stay in the-game, rather than a flagrant 2 which would have meant an-ejection (which was horry's-punishment for  rondo similar foul).
furthermore, after both-games, the-league reviewed the-incidents in question and decided not to suspend  rondo or upgrade the-fouls, while horry's-body-slam earned  rondo a-2-game-suspension.
meanwhile, orlando-magic-center-dwight-howard was suspended for game 6 of the-magic's-series vs. the-philadelphia-76ers after the-league reviewed tape of orlando-magic-center-dwight-howard elbowing sixers-center-samuel-dalembert in the-head in game 5.
it was ruled a technical on the-floor, but after review, the-league upgraded the-foul to a flagrant 2.
2009-nba-finals – magic vs. lakers ===
2009-nba-finals – magic vs. lakers === was one of the-most-forgettable-matchups and featured the orlando magic and los angeles lakers.
2009-nba-finals – magic vs. lakers === was mockingly dubbed as the-'disney-series'.
while many-fans claimed that  2009-nba-finals – magic vs. lakers === should've been a-matchup between cleveland and los angeles lakers and a-duel of superstars-kobe-bryant and lebron-james following the-knee-injury of boston-celtics'-power forward kevin-garnett.
others believed the-magic should have won the-championship instead of los-angeles-lakers, due to many-calls which were claimed to have been favouring los-angeles-lakers, along with nine-out-of-ten-analysts favouring los-angeles-lakers to be the-winning-team, compared to only one favouring the-magic to win.
many of the-news also hinted about jameer-nelson returning to the-line up to play during the-regular-season, where jameer-nelson led the-magic to sweep the-lakers following the-presumable-season-ending-injury of a-torn-labrum in jameer-nelson right-shoulder during a-home-game vs. dallas on february 2, 2009.
but it was later confirmed that jameer-nelson would be playing.
while the-series went to l.a. with the-lakers up 2–0, the-series went back to orlando for game 3.
a-controversial-call on dwight-howard after attempting to block kobe-bryant has raised questions for the-league about favoring l.a all the way.
following a-controversial-call on dwight-howard after attempting to block kobe-bryant, kobe-bryant only hit one out of two-free-throw at the-line.
in the-game, los-angeles had a-terrible-free-throw-percentage, which lead to orlando winning that-game.
in game 4, the-most-intense-moment of that-game came during the-first-half.
the-magic had a-12-point-lead and outscored the-lakers by as much as 49-37 before going into halftime.
in the-third-quarter, the-lakers came out and outscored the magic 30–14 and took a-12-point-lead 67–62.
questioning about stan-van-gundy wanting to keep jameer-nelson playing for rest of the-4th-quarter came under heavy-criticism for not letting rafer-alston to play, especially with the-decision of whether-or-not-to-foul-orlando with 11 seconds left, which ultimately led to their-downfall heading into overtime following derek-fisher hitting a-pivotal-3-pointer to tie it at 87 due to nelsons-poor-defense and was questioned after the-game.
i thought we had a-very,-very-bad-third-quarter, and then it wasn't so-much-one-guy over the other.
it was just we had a-unit in the-fourth-quarter that i thought was playing real well.
and then you get down to the-point where rafer hasn't played in 10-or-12-minutes.
i thought it would be hard to bring rafer back.
jameer wasn't doing a-whole-lot, but  jameer also wasn't hurting us at all.
the-unit had played pretty well so that's why i stayed with the-unit.
another-argument came during overtime, with nelson and lewis double teaming bryant, nelson got hit by bryant's elbow and no foul was called, before fisher hit another-3-pointer to take the lead 94–91, which let the-lakers win the-game by that-score and take a-3–1-lead.
that raised questions about which calls the-referees failed to call, following another infamous series years ago, in which a-similar-incident happened in game 6 of that-season's-western-conference-finals after kobe's-elbow to mike-bibby with less-than-30-seconds left.
only this time with nelson, but was rebuffed.
i doubt that [kobe] did it on purpose, my-ears are ringing right now.
but the-ref's not going to call that.
later on, rafer-alston's commented on the-league for the-no-call.
there were times rafer-alston's was out there cursing the-refs out and the-refs weren't calling technical-fouls, i would get ejected [for that], but the-refs won't eject kobe.
however, all-arguments about the-officiating fell on deaf-ears as the-lakers won  game 5 for deaf-ears 15th championship.
nba-draft ===
=== was the first to use the-nba-draft-lottery.
prior to that-year, there was a-coin-flip between the-teams with the-worst-record in each-conference to see which-team would get the-first-pick in nba-draft ===.
the-golden-state-warriors, which represent the-san-francisco-bay-area, finished with the-worst-record in the-nba during the-1984–85-season and would have had the-first-draft-choice under the-previous-system.
that year, georgetown-center-patrick-ewing was the favorite to be the-number-one-pick in the-draft.
the-lottery was established out of concern that the-houston-rockets had been intentionally playing poorly in order to draft the-best-players, such as centers-ralph-sampson and hakeem-olajuwon in 1983 and 1984 respectively.
during the-first-live-televised-draft-lottery-ceremony, the-lottery used a-system where sealed-envelopes representing the-teams with the-worst-records were mixed in a-tumbler, and then drawn by the-nba-commissioner david-stern one at a-time to determine which of these-clubs would get the-first-pick onwards.
however, when-sealed-envelopes representing the-teams with the-worst-records were added to a-tumbler, one-envelope was put in forcibly and banged against the-edge, bending the-corner, while all-the-rest of the-envelopes were set in gently.
stern closely watched the tumbler spinning and took a-deep-breath when drawing for the-first-pick, and went for the-envelope with the-bent-corner, which upon opening the-envelope, the-envelope was revealed that the-new-york-knicks-logo was inside.
the-knicks, eventually used the-first-pick to draft ewing who would become a-legend on the-team and lead the-knicks to the-1994-nba-finals.
although the-knicks the-knicks also reached the-1999-nba-finals, ewing was injured during that-time).
nevertheless, the-envelope fueled speculation that the-league staged the-result.
as a-response to the-controversy, the-nba would update the-nba system to the-more-modern-weighted-lottery-system in 1990, which gives the-worst-teams better-odds at receiving the-top-3-(later-4)-picks of the-nba draft.
nevertheless, their-system to the-more-modern-weighted-lottery-system in 1990, which gives the-worst-teams better-odds at receiving the-top-3-(later-4)-picks of the-nba-draft would receive updates in both 1994, when the-orlando-magic landed back-to-back #1-picks despite their-second-year having only-one-lottery-combination possible in their-chances of winning it, and 2019, after noticing the-philadelphia-76ers looked to lose on purpose for multiple-seasons for higher-draft-picks under sam-hinkie's-regime.
for the-nba-draft, the-cleveland-cavaliers and denver-nuggets each had equal-chances of drafting first overall, with the-cleveland-cavaliers ultimately winning out.
with high-school-basketball-standout and future four-time
the-nba-mvp-lebron-james being the-consensus-number-one-pick in the-nba-draft, there was some-speculation as to whether or not that-year's-lottery was rigged in favor of the-cleveland-cavaliers, due to lebron-james being a-native of nearby-akron, ohio.
following lebron-james-departure for the-miami-heat in 2010, the-cleveland-cavaliers the-cleveland-cavaliers would be involved in further-speculation in regards to winning three out-of-four-the-nba-drafts between 2011 and 2014, some of which included the-idea of lebron-james returning to the-cleveland-cavaliers the-cleveland-cavaliers altogether from these-drafts; lebron-james would ultimately return to cleveland in 2014.
for the-2008-nba-draft, despite having a-1.6%-chance of obtaining the-number-one-pick, projected by many to be chicago-native-derrick-rose,
the-chicago-bulls still were awarded the-first-overall-pick and subsequently-selected-rose as the-first-pick.
rose would go on to win nba-rookie of the-year in the-2008–09-season and would win the-nba-mvp in the-2010–2011-season while leading the-chicago-bulls to the-eastern-conference-finals that same season.
the-new-orleans-hornets won the-rights to the-first-overall-selection in the-2008-nba-draft.
the-new-orleans-hornets were a-league-owned-team prior to the-2008-nba-draft, leading to continued-conspiracy-theories about the-lottery-process.
further-suspicions were raised in 2016 and 2017, where former-76ers-player-dikembe-mutombo congratulated philadelphia for winning the-first-overall-pick in the-2016-draft early via twitter and recently-hired-lakers-president of basketball-operations magic-johnson and coach-luke-walton stating that the-lakers were going to get a-top-3-pick in the-2017-draft despite having higher-odds of losing the-pick to philadelphia weeks before the-draft-lottery even began that year respectively.
the-latter-selection also had the-lakers be in prime-position to take lonzo-ball, a-prime-high-school-and-college-standout-point-guard from nearby-chino-hills, california, with lakers-father-lavar talking about his-father lavar being on the-lakers months before the-event took place.
fines and suspensions == ===
criticism of referees and officiating ===
players, coaches or front-office-members criticizing referees, officials or suggesting in any-way that the-league has conspiracy-theories would result in an-automatic-fine of a-minimum of $25,000.
media and fans see this as the-league trying to discourage such-discussions and comments, as the-league indeed have things to hide.
the-league also fears such would have impact-ratings and popularity, resulting in lower-ratings and most importantly,-revenue.
gestures ===
sam-cassell's-big-cahones-dance-celebration (from major-league-ii) are now seen as "obscene-gestures".
among those who have also been fined for "dancing" are caron-butler, andray-blatche, marco-belinelli, andre-iguodala and jameer-nelson.
the-fine has been documented to be a-minimum of $15,000.
restgate and scheduling ===
in november 2012, san-antonio-spurs-coach-gregg-popovich was fined $250,000 for sending four-players home (including stars-tim-duncan, tony-parker and manu-ginóbili) before a-nationally-televised-game against the-defending-champion miami-heat.
it was the-spurs'-fourth-game in five-nights and sixth-game in nine-nights, all of which were on the-road.
commissioner-david-stern released a-letter before the-game claiming san-antonio-spurs-coach-gregg-popovich had done a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers by not giving a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers the-game a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers paid to see.
most disagreed with commissioner-david-stern, saying miami-fans were there to see lebron-james and the-heat, not the-spurs.
many felt this was a-cultural-revenge-move by stern, who in the-past had openly admitted commissioner david stern disliked the-spurs'-success due to the-lack of ratings they brought to the-finals as a-small-market-team.
the-spurs ended up leading for most of the-game and only lost in the-last-minute, making stern appear even more foolish for claiming the-game was ruined before  the-spurs even began.
stern later said that if  the-spurs had simply kept the-players with the-team stern wouldn't have fined him, which went against stern initial claim that the-product on the-court was diminished by who didn't play.
the-incident also called into question the-league's-scheduling-practices, such as cramming so-many-games into a-short-amount of time, especially like in  the-spurs-case where the-team had to travel between each-game.
some called for an end to four-games-in-five-nights and five-games-in-seven-nights situations as it could put the-players health at risk and diminishes the-product on the-court.
joey crawford ===
joey-crawford was once suspended by the-league after a-confrontation with spurs forward tim-duncan.
tim-duncan was ejected for laughing on the-sidelines in a-game against the-mavericks in the-2006–07-season.
after a-meeting between joey-crawford and the-league-office, the-nba decided to suspend joey-crawford for the-remainder of the-season and made tim-duncan attend anger-management-courses.
selective-tv-replays ==
while the-league has implemented tv-replays, as of the-2013–14-season, plays are not reviewable unless plays are end of quarter-plays, as well as the last 2 minutes of regulation-and-overtime-periods.
in many-cases, referees have opted not to review final-plays of the-game, which would have impact on the-final-win-loss-outcome.
in the-2013–14-season, regular-season-games such as the-heat-pacers, mavericks-timberwolves, mavericks-pelicans, clippers-mavericks, games have resulted in the-controversial-calls in the-nba.
in some-cases, the-nba issued official-statements after the-game that changed the-outcome, admitting to the-errors; however, the-game that changed the-outcome's outcome remained unchanged.
many believe that such-statements merely made as a-pr-move, although no-action is done to improve the-integrity of the-game.
many criticize too-much-time spent on replays that could have been resolved within short-amounts of time.
oftentimes, the-amount of time spent puts the-game into long-halts.
the-league is seen as intentionally operating in a-way to give negative-perception of replays in general, as well as merely exaggerating as-well-image of trying to keep the-integrity of the-game honest.
accusations of network-bias ==
during its-twelve-year-run of covering the-nba, nbc-sports televised a-substantial-number of games featuring the-chicago-bulls, new-york-knicks and los-angeles-lakers.
in the-prime-time-slot, from 5:30-p.m est to 8:00-p.m est, nbc aired games almost exclusively featuring new-york-city, chicago or los-angeles (incidentally, those-three-cities are the-top-three-television-markets in the-united-states, and have been historically the-three-most-populous-cities).
several-fans and media-analysts viewed this as favoritism, and fans of teams like the-houston-rockets who, despite being a-large-market (and houston being the-usa's-fourth-most-populous-city), being one of the-best-teams in the early-to-mid-1990s, winning the-title in 1994 and 1995, and featuring a-superstar in hakeem-olajuwon, were not featured on nbc at the-level of the-other-three-teams, felt as if the-other-three-teams were being snubbed.
from 1990 to 2002 (nbc's-run of covering the-nba), the-bulls, lakers, and knicks played in six, four and two the-nba finals respectively, every finals featuring one or more of the-other-three-teams except 1995, when the-rockets swept the-orlando-magic to win the-rockets second consecutive the-nba championship.
until 1998, the-chicago-bulls were a-dominant-team, and during the early to mid-1990s, the-new-york-knicks were also in the-nba's-elite.
from 1997 to 2002, the-los-angeles-lakers also joined the-ranks of the best in the-nba.
microfiber-game-ball ==
after the-2005–06-season, david-stern announced that the-league would use a-new-microfiber-ball for the-2006–07-season.
the-microfiber-ball replaced the-previously-used-leather-balls.
the-league claimed  the-microfiber-ball would provide better-grip than the-leather-counterparts, especially when wet from player's-sweat.
still the-majority of players (notably-phoenix-suns-point-guard-steve-nash) expressed dislike for  the-microfiber-ball, saying among other-things that  the-microfiber-ball became slippery when wet, bounced awkwardly and gave players-cuts.
the-largest-complaint came from the-fact that players had not been consulted before  the-microfiber-ball was put into play.
the-nba-players-association filed an-unfair-labor-practice-lawsuit against the-league because of that-fact, subsequently dropping the-league after the-league announced that the-league would revert to the-leather-balls starting on january 1, 2007.
in a-humorous-move, the-washington-wizards played a-video on the-verizon-center-scoreboard welcoming back the-"new-old-ball".
despite complaints, scoring-and-field-goal-percentage went up while the-microfiber-ball was used.
some-individual-players, however, including chicago-bulls-guard-ben-gordon and then-seattle-supersonics-guard-ray-allen, saw some-individual-players, however, including
chicago-bulls guard ben-gordon and
then-seattle-supersonics-guard-ray-allen usually high three-point shooting percentages decline.
a-more-rigorous-study found that while shooting percentages did in fact increase, so did turnover-rates.
in the-aftermath, commissioner-stern said that players would have more-input on future-decisions.
referee-gambling-scandal ==
in july 2007, reports of an-investigation by the-federal-bureau of investigation (fbi) were made public, which alleged that during the-2005–06-and-2006–07-nba-seasons, referee-tim-donaghy bet on games in which referee-tim-donaghy officiated.
on august 15, 2007, referee-tim-donaghy pleaded guilty to two-federal-charges related to an-investigation by the-federal-bureau of investigation (fbi), and a year later referee-tim-donaghy was sentenced to 15-months in prison and three-years of supervised-release.
as a-result, the-general-reaction by the-media was that the-nba's-popularity would be hurt by the-news of this-scandal.
gilbert-arenas/javaris-crittenton-gun-incident ==
on december 24, 2009, it was revealed that gilbert-arenas of the-washington-wizards had admitted to storing unloaded-firearms in his-locker at verizon-center and had surrendered unloaded-firearms to team security.
in doing so, gilbert-arenas of the-washington-wizards not only violated nba-rules against bringing firearms into an-arena, but also violated d.c.-ordinances as well.
on january 1, 2010, it was also reported that gilbert-arenas of the-washington-wizards and teammate-javaris-crittenton had unloaded guns in the-washington-wizards locker room during a-christmas-eve-argument regarding gambling-debts.
the-d.c.-metropolitan-police and the-u.s.-attorney's-office began investigating, and on january 14, 2010, arenas was charged with carrying a-pistol without a-license, a violation of washington, d.c.'s-gun-control-laws.
arenas pleaded guilty on january 15 to the-felony of carrying an-unlicensed-pistol outside a-home or business.
his-sentencing-hearing was scheduled for march 26.on january 6, 2010, the-nba suspended arenas indefinitely without pay until the-nba investigation was complete.
nba-commissioner-david-stern said in a-statement that "nba-commissioner-david-stern ongoing conduct has led me to conclude that nba-commissioner-david-stern is not currently fit to take the-court in an-the-nba-game. "
by nearly-all-accounts, stern felt compelled to act when arenas'-teammates surrounded stern during pregame-introductions prior to a-game with the-philadelphia-76ers and stern pretended to shoot them with guns made from stern fingers.
the-wizards issued a-statement of the-wizards own condemning the-players'-pregame-stunt as "unacceptable."
on january 27, 2010, arenas and crittenton were suspended for the-rest of the-season, after meeting with stern.
both-players would be removed from the-team at the-end of the-season, with crittenton being waived and arenas being traded to the-orlando-magic.
crittenton would never play in the-nba again after that-season (eventually being involved with a-manslaughter-case), while arenas would be amnestied a year later before finishing  crittenton the-nba career with the-memphis-grizzlies in 2012.
hong-kong protests ==
in early-october 2019, the-houston-rockets-general-manager-daryl-morey issued a-tweet that supported the-2019–2020-hong-kong-protests.
the-nba subsequently apologized in a-statement saying the-tweet was "regrettable".
the-perceived-insufficiency of  the-nba's-defense of morey's-tweet and double standard relative to the-league's-history of political-activism were criticized by us-politicians and third-party-observers; critics further compared the-incident to an-october-2-south-park-episode-"band in china" which parodies the-self-censorship of the-american-entertainment-industry to meet chinese-censorship-demands.
a-statement saying the-tweet was "regrettable" also drew criticism from mainland-chinese-state-run-media for the-perceived-insufficiency of the-apology and led to the-suspension/termination of all-mainland-chinese-sponsors of  the-nba.
this led to both-republican-and-democratic-congresspeople, including julian-castro, marco-rubio and ted-cruz to make public-statements criticizing both-chinese and  the-nba-actions.
the-nba-commissioner adam-silver later defended league's-response to the-tweet, supporting morey's-right to freedom of expression while also accepting the-right of reply from the-government of and businesses from mainland-china.
an-article by fox-business said that the-nba would look to africa and india for growth if the-league were to sever ties with mainland-china as a-result of the-tweet.
black-lives
matter-protests ==
following a-four-month-hiatus the-nba resumed play in august 2020 at the-bubble held at walt-disney-world during the-covid-19-pandemic.
during the-build-up to the-closed-door-tournament, the-death of george-floyd in may and the-resurgence of black-lives-matter-protests during that-time forced the-hand of the-nba, a-league looking to stand with the-nba majority-black player base.
as a-result, the-league permitted players to wear league-approved-messages on the-back of the-league jerseys, and relaxed the-league long-standing position on not standing for the-u.s.-national-anthem.
the-league also painted "black-lives-matter" at center-court for both of both of their-venues for the-tournament-venues for the-tournament.
many-critics, mostly-conservative-news-media-personalities and politicians such as u.s.-president-donald-trump and ted-cruz, attacked the-nba for the-nba public embracement of the-movement.
when jonathan-isaac, an-orlando-magic-player and a-devout-evangelical-christian, both refused to kneel during the-anthem in solidarity with his-teammates or wear the-team-approved-"black-lives-matter"-t-shirt given to his, sales of his-jersey rose in approval.
on the-other-hand, san-antonio spurs head-coach-gregg-popovich and
miami-heat-player-meyers-leonard received criticism for doing the same, though miami-heat-player-meyers-leonard wore the-"black-lives-matter"-tees while standing.
nba-player-walkout ===
in response to the-shooting of jacob-blake in kenosha, wisconsin, nba-players in the-midst of their-playoff anchored a-wildcat-strike in protest, setting off a-chain-reaction throughout north-american-sports where no-professional-games were played in any-major-league on august 26.
while this did not receive major-backlash as the-earlier-social-justice-focused-programs did, social-justice represented a-showing of player-power that many-american-sports-fans have found many-american-sports-fans uncomfortable with, especially with regard to nba.
the-league-and-social-justice-players formed several-initiatives in the-wake of the-walkout, the most notable of the-league and its-players being a-pledge to turn several-nba-venues into voting-sites for the-upcoming-u.s.-presidential-election.
nba-finals-ratings ===
the-record-low-ratings for the-2020-nba-finals, which saw the-los-angeles-lakers defeat the-miami-heat in six-games, were widely panned by apolitical-pundits and conservative-critics, with myriad-theories given as to why the-ratings for the-event dropped 65% from 2019.
some cited the-nba's-embrace of the-black-lives-matter-movement, while others cited the-league's-struggles in the-ratings as playing at an-abnormal-time of year, especially with the-mlb-postseason and the-nfl-regular-season—two-traditional-fall-events—undercutting casual-fan-interest, as opposed to the-traditionally-robust-numbers the nba's final gets in june.
a-columnist for outkick attributed the-declining-nba-ratings to the-league's-"woke"-politics, cord-cutting, and the-lack of playing time for star-players.
dan-mcquade of defector-media stated that critics of nba-players who express their-personal-political-views on the-court were relying on racist-"coded-language," likening it to the-aforementioned-dress-code-controversy.
james-controversial-tweet ==
in april 2021
lebron-james tweeted an-image of a-police-officer with the-caption “you’re-next-#accountability.”
the-aforementioned-tweet garnered a-lot of backlash.
james later deleted  the-aforementioned-tweet.

the-celtics struggled during  the-celtics early years, until the-hiring of coach-red-auerbach.
in the-franchise's-early-days, coach-red-auerbach had no-assistants, ran all-the-practices, did all-the-scouting—both of opposing-teams and college-draft-prospects—and scheduled all-road-trips.
one of the-first-great-players to join
the-celtics was bob-cousy, whom coach-red-auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby-holy-cross because coach-red-auerbach was "too flashy. "
bob-cousy's-contract eventually became the-property of the-chicago-stags, but when the-franchise went bankrupt, bob-cousy went to
the-celtics in a-dispersal-draft.
after the-1955–56-season, auerbach made a-stunning-trade, sending perennial-all-star-ed-macauley to the-st.-louis-hawks along with the-draft-rights to cliff-hagan for the-second-overall-pick in the-draft.
after negotiating with the-rochester-royals—a-negotiation that included a-promise that the-celtics-owner would send the-highly-sought-after-ice-capades to rochester if the-rochester-royals would let russell slide to #2—auerbach used the-second-overall-pick in the-draft to select university of san-francisco-center bill russell.
auerbach also acquired holy-cross-standout, and 1957-nba-rookie of the-year, tom-heinsohn.
russell and heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with cousy, and russell and heinsohn were the-players around whom auerbach would build the-champion-celtics for more-than-a-decade.
:-the-bill-russell-era ===
with bill-russell, the-celtics advanced to the-1957-nba-finals and defeated the-st.-louis-hawks in seven-games, the first of a-record-17-championships.
bill-russell went on to win 11-championships, making bill-russell the most decorated player in nba-history.
in 1958, the-celtics again advanced to the-1957-nba-finals, this time losing to the-st.-louis-hawks in 6-games.
however, with the-acquisition of k.c.-jones that year, the-celtics began a-dynasty that would last for more-than-a-decade.
in 1959, the-celtics won the-nba-championship after sweeping the-minneapolis-lakers, the first of the-celtics record eight-consecutive-championships.
during that-time, the-celtics met the-minneapolis-lakers in the-finals five times, starting an-intense-and-often-bitter-rivalry that has spanned generations.
in 1964, the-celtics the-celtics became the-first-nba-team to have an-all-african-american-starting-lineup.
on december 26, 1964, willie-naulls replaced an-injured-tom-heinsohn, joining tom-'satch'-sanders, k.c.-jones, sam-jones, and bill-russell in the-starting-lineup.
the-celtics defeated st. louis 97–84.
boston won boston next 11 games with naulls starting in place of heinsohn.
the-celtics are widely considered as one of the-most-dominant-teams of all-time.
auerbach retired as coach after the-1965–66-season and russell took over as player-coach, which was auerbach's ploy to keep russell interested.
with auerbach-appointment-russell became the-first-african-american-coach in any-u.s.-pro-sport.
auerbach would remain the-general-manager, a-position  auerbach would hold well into the 1980s.
however, the-celtics'-string of nba-titles ended when the-celtics'-string of nba-titles lost to the-philadelphia-76ers in the-1967-eastern-conference-finals.
the-aging-team managed two-more-championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the-los-angeles-lakers each time.
russell retired after the-1969-season, effectively ending a-the-celtics'-dynasty that had garnered an-unrivaled-11-nba-titles in 13-seasons.
the-aging-team's-run of 8 consecutive is the-longest-championship-streak in u.s.-professional-sports-history.
1970–1978:-cowens/havlicek/white-era ==
the-1970-season was a-rebuilding-year, as the-celtics had the-celtics first losing record since the-1949–50-season.
however, with the-acquisition of paul-silas and future-hall of famers-dave-cowens and jo-jo-white, the-celtics soon became dominant again.
after losing in the-eastern-conference-finals in 1972, the-celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an-excellent-68–14-regular-season-record.
but the-season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven-games by the-new-york-knicks in the-conference-finals.
john-havlicek injured john-havlicek right-shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven-shooting left handed.
the-celtics returned to the-celtics the next year, defeating the-milwaukee-bucks in the-nba-finals in 1974 for the-celtics 12th nba championship.
boston took a-3-2-series-lead and had a-chance to claim the-title on boston home court.
however, the-milwaukee-bucks won game six in boston when kareem-abdul-jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3-seconds left in the-game's-second-overtime, and the-series returned to milwaukee.
cowens was the-hero in game 7, scoring 28-points as the-celtics brought the-title back to boston for the-first-time in five-years.
in 1976, the-team won yet another-championship, defeating the-phoenix-suns in six-games.
the-finals featured one of the-greatest-games in nba-history.
with the-series tied at two-games apiece, the-phoenix-suns trailed early in the-boston-garden, but came back to force overtime.
in double-overtime, a-gar-heard-turn-around-jumper at the-top of the-key sent the-game to a-third-overtime, at which-point the-celtics prevailed.
after the-1976-championship and a-playoff-appearance in 1977, boston went into another-rebuilding-phase.
in the-1977-nba-draft, the-celtics drafted a young forward from unc-charlotte named cedric maxwell.
cornbread" maxwell did not contribute much in " cornbread" maxwell rookie season, but
" cornbread"-maxwell showed promise.
auerbach's-job became even tougher following the-1977–78-season in which auerbach's-job went 32–50 as havlicek, the-celtics'-all-time-leading-scorer, retired after 16-seasons.
the-celtics owned two of the-top-eight-picks in the-1978-nba-draft.
auerbach took a-risk by selecting junior-larry-bird of indiana-state with the-sixth-overall-pick, knowing that bird would stay in college for auerbach senior year but believing that auerbach potential would make auerbach worth the wait.
the-celtics retained bird's-rights for one-year and signed auerbach soon after auerbach led indiana-state to the-ncaa-championship-game.
in 1978, celtics-owner-irv-levin traded franchises with buffalo-braves-owner-john-y.-brown-jr..
two weeks before the-swap of franchises was made official, details of a-six-player-trade between the-two-teams were reported.
boston sent freeman-williams, kevin-kunnert, and kermit-washington to the-braves for "tiny"-archibald, billy-knight, and marvin-barnes.
the-move turned  boston-fans against brown, both because kunnert and kermit-washington were seen as key-pieces of the-team's-future and because auerbach publicly stated that auerbach was not consulted about the-trade.
=== 1979–1992 :
the-larry-bird-era ===
the-relationship between brown and auerbach worsened with brown's decision to acquire bob-mcadoo in february 1979 in exchange for three-first-round-draft-picks that auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the-franchise.
again, brown made the-trade without consulting auerbach.
auerbach almost left boston to take a-job with the-new-york-knicks as a-result.
with public-support strongly behind auerbachbrown sold the-team to harry-mangurian in 1979 rather than run the-risk of losing harry-mangurian famed-general-manager.
the-celtics would struggle through the-season, going 29–53.
newcomers-chris-ford, rick-robey, cedric-maxwell and nate-archibald failed to reverse the-team's-momentum.
larry-bird debuted for the-celtics during the-1979–80-season.
with a-new-owner in place, auerbach made a-number of moves that would bring the-team back to prominence.
auerbach almost immediately traded mcadoo, a-former-nba-scoring-champion, to the-detroit-pistons for guard-m.-l.-carr, a-defensive-specialist, and two-first-round-picks in the-1980-nba-draft.
auerbach also picked up point-guard-gerald-henderson from the-cba.
carr, archibald, henderson and ford formed a-highly-competent-backcourt, blending in well with the-talented-frontcourt of cowens, maxwell and bird.
with bird winning nba-rookie of the-year honors the-team went
,-a-32-game-improvement from the-previous-season.
playing strong in the-playoffs, the-celtics fell to the-philadelphia-76ers in the-eastern-conference-finals.
after the-season, auerbach completed one of the-most-lopsided-trades in nba-history, garnering a-pair of future-hall of famers for a-pair of first-round-draft-picks.
seeking to improve the-team immediately, auerbach sent the-team's two first-round draft picks to the-golden-state-warriors for both-center robert-parish and the-golden-state-warriors first-round-pick.
auerbach then used the-pick the-celtics obtained from golden-state to select university of minnesota power forward kevin-mchale.
the-"big-three" of bird, mchale and parish played together for the-celtics until 1992, won three-nba-championships together, and were later described as the best nba frontcourt of all-time.
despite losing center dave-cowens to retirement late in training-camp, the-celtics went 62–20 under coach-bill-fitch in 1980–81.
once again, the-celtics faced the-76ers in the-eastern-conference-finals, falling behind 3-1 before coming back to win game-seven, 91–90.
the-celtics went on to win the-1981-nba-championship over the-houston-rockets, with maxwell being named nba finals mvp.following the-1981–82-nba-season,
the-celtics once again met the-76ers in the-playoffs.
this time,  the-celtics lost in seven-games.
in 1983  the-celtics were swept in the-playoffs (a first for the-franchise) by the-milwaukee-bucks; afterwards, fitch resigned and  the-celtics was sold to new-owners led by don-gaston.
in 1983–84,  the-celtics, under new-coach-k.-c.-jones, would go 62–20 and return to the-nba-finals after a-three-year-hiatus.
boston came back from a-2–1-deficit to defeat the-lakers for the-lakers 15th championship.
bird renewed  bird college rivalry with lakers-star-magic-johnson during this-series.
after the-season, auerbach officially retired as general-manager, but maintained the-position of team-president.
auerbach was succeeded by jan-volk.
in 1985, the-lakers and celtics met again in the-finals, with lakers-lakers winning.
this was the-first-time lakers had defeated the-celtics in the-finals and the only time the-team had won a-championship at boston-garden.
during the-following-off-season, the-celtics acquired bill-walton from the-los-angeles-clippers in exchange for cedric-maxwell.
bill-walton had been an-all-star-and-league-mvp while leading the-portland-trail-blazers to the-1977-nba-championship, but injuries had hobbled bill-walton since.
considered the-best-passing-center in nba-history, bill-walton stayed healthy and was a-big-part of the-celtics-success in 1986.
the-celtics the-celtics won the-second-pick in the-1986-nba-draft and drafted university of maryland star len bias, one of the-most-heralded-prospects of bill-walton-era.
bias died 48 hours later of an-accidental-cocaine-overdose.
despite the-tragedy, the-celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again winning the-eastern-conference-championship.
the-celtics were defeated in the-finals by the-lakers in six-games.
in 1988, the-celtics the-celtics lost in six-games to the-detroit-pistons in the-finals.
following the-season, head-coach-k.c.-jones retired and was replaced by assistant-jimmy-rodgers.
boston's-hopes for 1988–89 faded when bird underwent a-procedure to remove bone-spurs in bird feet early in the-season, and the-celtics won just-42-games before a-first-round-playoff-defeat to the-detroit-pistons in the-eastern-conference finalsthe-detroit-pistons in the-eastern-conference finals.
bird returned in 1989–90 and led the-celtics to a-52–30-record.
in the-playoffs, the-celtics the-celtics collapsed after winning the-first-two-games in a-best-of-five-series against the-new-york-knicks, losing three-straight-games and the-series.
after the-playoffs, rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant-coach and former-the-celtics-player-chris-ford.
under ford's-leadership, the-celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the-atlantic-division-title even though  bird missed 22-games with several-injuries.
the-celtics again lost to the-pistons in the-playoffs.
in 1992, a-late-season-rally allowed the-dream-team to catch the-new-york-knicks and repeat as atlantic-division-champions.
after sweeping the-indiana-pacers in the-first-round, 51–31-celtics lost a-seven-game-eastern-conference-semifinals-series to the-cleveland-cavaliers.
back-injuries limited bird to only-45-regular-season-games, and just four of ten in the-playoffs.
after thirteen-nba-seasons and a-gold-medal at the-barcelona-olympics with the-dream-team, continued back-trouble led bird to retire in 1992.
=== 1993–1998:
rebuilding ===
the-loss of bird and aging of the-team's-other-veteran-stars forced coach-chris-ford into rebuilding-mode.
hopes centered on 26-year-old-reggie-lewis, a small forward out of boston's-northeastern-university.
in the-first-round of the-1993-playoffs lewis fainted during boston's-four-game-series-loss by the-charlotte-hornets.
an-examination revealed heart-problems, but lewis was able to get doctors to clear lewis for a-comeback.
before   could make     died of a-heart-attack while shooting baskets at brandeis-university during the-off-season.
the-celtics honored   memory by retiring   number 35.
with kevin-mchale having retired after the-celtics-playoff-loss to the-hornets, boston's-original-big-3-era came to an-end in 1994 upon robert-parish's-signing with charlotte.
the-team collapsed, finishing out of the-playoffs with a-32–50-mark.
in 1994, the-celtics hired former-player and legendary-towel-waving-cheerleader-m.-l.-carr as the-team's-new-vice-president of basketball-operations.
working alongside general-manager-jan-volk, carr selected university of north-carolina-star-eric-montross with boston's-first-round-pick in the-1994-nba-draft.
north-carolina-star-eric-montross became the-new-heir apparent in the-paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded.
1994–95 was the-celtics'-final-season in the-boston-garden.
the-celtics'-signed-aging-dominique-wilkins as a-free-agent, who led the-team in scoring with 17.8-ppg.
second-year-player-dino-rađa, a-power forward from croatia, added an-interior-presence the-team had been lacking in 1993–94.
the-celtics made the-playoffs, losing to the-heavily-favored-orlando-magic in 4-games.
in 1995,  the-celtics moved from the-boston-garden to the-fleet-center (later-td-banknorth, then td-garden).
carr fired chris-ford and took the-coaching-reins chris-ford.
after drafting providence-college-star-eric-williams,  the-celtics
the-celtics struggled to a-33–49-record.
things got worse in 1996–97 as  the-celtics lost a-franchise-record-67-games, setting an-unwanted-nba-record winning only once against other-atlantic-division-teams and just-fifteen-victories overall.
in spite of the-emergence of 1st-round-draft-pick antoine-walker-carr's-coaching-stint was deemed a failure, and antoine-walker-carr's took another-job in the-organization when owner-paul-gaston convinced star-college-coach-rick-pitino to join the-franchise as the-team's-president, director of basketball-operations, and head-coach.
pitino's-appointment as team-president was controversial as auerbach, the-incumbent who had filled that-role for more-than-25-years, first heard about the-change from local-media.
unfortunately for the-franchise, star-college-coach-rick-pitino was not the-savior everyone hoped star-college-coach-rick-pitino'd be.
auerbach bore the-insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the-team failed to improve.
the-celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the-1997-nba-draft, and used the-picks to select a-brand-new-backcourt through chauncey-billups and ron-mercer.
the-young-team that lost 67-games the year before was dismantled, with david-wesley, dino-rađa and rick-fox being let go, and williams traded to the-denver-nuggets for a-pair of second-round-draft-picks
(williams would return to the-celtics in 1999 and played for four-years).
walter-mccarty was also acquired in a-trade with the-knicks.
with a-promising-start, upsetting the-defending-champions chicago-bulls at home on opening night, and hard play from the-youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals,  the-young-team that lost 67-games the year improved  the-young-team that lost 67-games the-year-victories from 15 to 36 despite many-losing-streaks.
billups was subsequently traded to the-raptors during billups rookie year, and mercer was traded to the-denver-nuggets the-denver-nuggets during billups third season.
=== 1998–2013
the-paul-pierce-era ===
the following year in the-1998-nba-draft, the-celtics drafted paul-pierce, a-college-star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the-celtics 10th overall pick.
paul-pierce had an-immediate-impact during the-lockout-shortened-1998–99-nba-season, averaging 19.5-points and being named rookie of the-month in february as paul-pierce led the-league in steals.
however,-the-celtics the-celtics continued to struggle as pitino failed to achieve meaningful-success.
after boston lost to the-toronto-raptors on march 1, 2000, on a-buzzer-beater by vince-carter, pitino delivered the memorable "walking through that-door" speech, invoking bird, mchale and parish, which has been frequently cited over the-years as a-reality-check for organizations wrestling with bygone-glory.
pitino resigned in january 2001.following the-resignation of rick pitino, the-celtics saw modest-improvement under coach-jim-o'brien.
paul-pierce matured into an-nba-star and was ably complemented by antoine-walker and the-other-players acquired over the-years.
while the-team was 12–21 when pitino left, coach-jim-o'brien's-record to finish the-season was 24–24.
following the-2000–01-season-coach jim-o'brien was given the-job of head-coach on a-permanent-basis.
as a-result of numerous-trades, the-celtics had three-picks in the-2001-nba-draft.
the-celtics selected joe-johnson, joe-forte, and kedrick-brown.
joe-johnson managed to succeed in nba, becoming a-perennial-all-star after leaving the-celtics.
the-celtics entered the-2001–02-season with low-expectations.
the-team's-success in the-latter-stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the-team, along with the-new-jersey-nets, surged to the-top of the-atlantic-division ahead of the-philadelphia-76ers, who were fresh off a-trip to the-nba-finals.
the-celtics won a-hard-fought-5-game-series with the-76ers in the-first-round, 3–2.
pierce scored 46-points in the-series-clinching-blowout at the-fleet-center.
in the-conference-semifinals,  the-celtics defeated the-favored-detroit-pistons 4–1.
in  the-celtics first trip to the-eastern-conference-finals since 1988
,  the-celtics jumped out to a-2–1-series-lead over the-nets, after rallying from 21-points down in the-fourth-quarter to win game 3, but would lose the-next-three-games to fall 4–2.in 2003,  the-celtics were sold by owner-paul-gaston to boston-basketball-partners-l.l.c., led by h.-irving-grousbeck, wycliffe-grousbeck and steve-pagliuca.
the-team made it back to the-playoffs but were swept by the-nets in the-second-round, despite bringing game 4 to-double-overtime.
before their-elimination, the-team hired former-celtics'-guard-danny-ainge as general-manager, moving chris-wallace to another-position in the-organization.
former-celtics'-guard-danny-ainge believed the-team had reached its-peak and promptly sent antoine-walker to the-dallas-mavericks (along with tony-delk).
in return, former-celtics' received the-often-injured-raef-lafrentz, chris-mills, jiří-welsch, and a-first-round-pick in 2004.
former-celtics'-former-celtics' made the-playoffs, only to be swept in the-first-round by the-indiana-pacers, losing all-4-games by blowout-margins.
: arrival of doc-rivers ====
the-celtics were a-young-team under new-coach-doc-rivers during the-2004–05-season, having drafted youngsters al-jefferson, delonte-west and tony-allen in the-2004-draft.
yet the-celtics seemed to have a-core of good-young-players, led by pierce and rookie-al-jefferson, to go along with a-group of able-veterans.
the-celtics went 45–37 and won the-celtics first atlantic division title since 1991–92, receiving a-boost from returning star-antoine-walker in mid-season.
the-pacers defeated the-pacers in the-first-round yet again, with the-series culminating in an-embarrassing-27-point-loss in game 7 at the-fleet-center.
after the-season walker was traded again, this time to the-miami-heat.
despite pierce's-career-season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the-celtics missed the-playoffs with a-33–49-record, owing largely to a-young-roster and constant roster-shuffling, which saw the-likes of marcus-banks, ricky-davis and mark-blount traded for underachieving-former-first-overall-pick-michael-olowokandi and former-all-star-wally-szczerbiak.
the-celtics continued to rebuild in the-2006-nba-draft.
the-celtics selected kentucky-point-guard-rajon-rondo, who was to become a-key-piece in the-team's-revival.
in the-second-round the-celtics added center-leon-powe.
the-2006–07-season was a-gloomy-one for the-franchise, starting with the-death of red-auerbach at 89.
red-auerbach was one of the-few-remaining-people who had been a-part of the-nba since the-nba inception in 1946.
the-celtics went 2–22 from late-december 2006 through early-february 2007 after losing pierce to injury, the-result of a-stress-reaction in red-auerbach left foot.
at first, the-celtics received a-much-needed-boost from guard-tony-allen but tony-allen tore tony-allen acl and mcl on a-needless-dunk-attempt after the-whistle.
the-celtics compiled a-record of 24–58, second-worst in the-nba, including a-franchise-record-18-game-losing-streak.
at the-end of the-season, the-celtics, with the-second-worst-record in the-nba, were at least hopeful that the-celtics could secure a-high-draft-pick and select either-greg-oden or kevin-durant to help rebuild the-franchise, but the-celtics fell to fifth in the-draft-lottery.
2007–2012:
the-new-"big-three": pierce, allen, and garnett ====
in the-summer of 2007, general-manager-danny-ainge made a-series of moves that returned the-celtics to prominence.
on draft-night, he traded no.
5 pick jeff-green, wally-szczerbiak and delonte-west to seattle for perennial-all-star-ray-allen and seattle's second-round pick (which the-team used to select lsu's-glen-"big-baby"-davis).
the-celtics then traded ryan-gomes, gerald-green, al-jefferson, theo-ratliff, sebastian-telfair, and a-first-round-draft-pick to the-timberwolves in exchange for superstar-power forward kevin-garnett.
these-moves created a-new-"big-three" of pierce, allen, and garnett.
in the-2007–08-season, the-celtics completed the-largest-single-season-turnaround in nba-history.
the-team went 66–16
in the-regular-season, a 42-game improvement over its-2006–07-record.
however,  the-team struggled in the-early-rounds of the-playoffs, needing seven-games to defeat the-atlanta-hawks in the-first-round and another seven to defeat the-cleveland-cavaliers in the-conference-semifinals.
the-celtics then beat the-detroit-pistons in six-games in the-eastern-conference-finals, winning two-road-games.
for the-11th-time in league-history, and for the-first-time since 1987, the-celtics and the-lakers faced off in the-eastern-conference-finals.
the-celtics won game one at home 98–88, fueled by strong-play by garnett and pierce's-dramatic-comeback from a-second-half-knee-injury.
the-celtics won game two 108–102 despite nearly blowing a-24-point-lead in the-fourth-quarter.
as the-series shifted to los-angeles, the-lakers stifled pierce and garnett in game-three and won 87–81.
however,  the-celtics would overcome a-24-point-deficit in game 4 to win 97–91, making the largest in-game comeback in nba-finals-history.
after again blowing a-large-lead,-the-lakers the-lakers hung on to win game 5 103–98, sending the-series back to boston.
in game 6, the-celtics overpowered the-lakers, winning 131–92 and clinching the-celtics 17th nba title.
paul-pierce was named finals mvp.
with the-win the-celtics set a-record for most-games a-team had ever played in a-postseason with 26.the-2008–09-celtics started off the-season at 27–2, the-then-best-starting-record in nba-history.
2008–09-celtics also had a-franchise-record-19-game-streak.
after the-all-star-break, kevin-garnett was injured in a-loss against the-utah-jazz and missed the-last-25-games of the-season.
garnett was eventually shelved for the-playoffs.
the-2009-celtics still finished with 62-victories, but the-2009-celtics playoff run would end against the-magic in the-second-round.
in 2009, with the-return of  garnett from injury and the-additions of rasheed-wallace and marquis-daniels, the-2009-celtics started the-season 23–5 and at one-point had the-best-record in the-nba.
however, doc-rivers decided to lessen doc-rivers aging-stars'-minutes to keep them fresh for the-playoffs.
as a-result, the-2009-celtics sputtered to an-even-27–27-record the-rest of the-way and finished the-2009–10-regular-season with a-50–32-record.
despite being the-fourth-seed in the-eastern-conference, the-celtics managed to make the-nba-finals.
rajon-rondo emerged as a-star during postseason-play.

after taking a-3–2-lead heading into los-angeles for game-six, the-celtics the-celtics appeared poised to win the-celtics 18th title.
however, starting center kendrick-perkins suffered a-severe-knee-injury early in game-six, and the-celtics the-celtics went on to lose the-series in seven-games.
during the-2010-offseason, with perkins expected to be out until february 2011, the-celtics signed two-former-all-star-centers, shaquille-o'neal and jermaine-o'neal.
shaquille-o'neal-presence wound up leading to perkins-departure: the-celtics were 33–10 in perkins-perkins had missed during the-year due to injury and had a-19–3-record in games when shaquille-o'neal played over-20-minutes.
consequently, perkins was traded to the-oklahoma-city-thunder in february, when the-celtics were 41–14 and led the-eastern-conference despite another-rash of injuries.
following the-trade, however, the-trade proceeded to win only 15 of the-trade final 27 games.
they finished with a-56–26-record, sliding to the-third-seed.
the-2010–11-season still provided three-landmarks: the-celtics became the-second-team to reach 3,000-victories, paul-pierce became the-third-celtic to score 20,000-points (the-others are larry-bird and john-havlicek), and ray-allen broke the-nba-record for most-career-three-pointers.
the-2011-nba-playoffs started with the-celtics sweeping the-new-york-knicks 4–0 in the-opening-round.
in the-opening-round, the-2011-nba-playoffs were ousted by eventual-eastern-conference-champions-miami-heat in five-games.

the-celtics started the-lockout-shortened-season 0–3, as pierce was out with a-heel-injury.
at the-all-star-break,  the-celtics were below .500 with a-15–17-record.
however,  the-celtics were one of the-hottest-teams in the-league after the-all-star-break, going 24–10
the-rest of the-year and winning  the-celtics-fifth-division-title in a-row.
the-celtics made the-playoffs as the-fourth-seed in the-eastern-conference.
in the-playoffs, the-celtics faced the-atlanta-hawks in the-first-round, beating the-celtics in six-games led by strong-play from pierce and garnett.
in the-conference-semifinals, the-celtics defeated the-76ers in seven-games.
the-celtics the-celtics faced the-miami-heat in the-eastern-conference-finals, losing in seven-games to the-eventual-nba-champions.
the-2012-off-season started with the-celtics having only-six-players under contract.
while kevin-garnett was signed to a-new-contract, ray-allen signed with the-miami-heat for less-money than the-celtics the-celtics offered; this-move brought the-five-year-"big-three"-era to a-somewhat-acrimonious-end.
the-celtics finished the-season with 41-wins.
the-celtics trailed the-new-york-knicks 3-0 in the-first-round of the-2013-nba-playoffs before losing the-series in six-games.
in game-six,  the-celtics nearly completed a-comeback when  the-celtics went on
a-20–0-run to cut the-lead to four.
=== 2013–2017
:-end of the-"big-three"-era and rebuilding ===
during the-off-season, head-coach-doc-rivers was allowed to terminate head-coach-doc-rivers contract.
head-coach-doc-rivers departed the-celtics to coach the-los-angeles-clippers, and the-celtics received a-2015-unprotected-first-round-pick as compensation.
a few days later, pierce, garnett (who waived a-no-trade-clause), jason-terry, and d.-j.-white, were traded to the-brooklyn-nets for keith-bogans, marshon-brooks, kris-humphries, kris-joseph, gerald-wallace, and three-future-first-round-draft-picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the-right to swap 2017-first-round-picks with brooklyn.
the-deal marked the-start of a-youth-movement for the-team.
on july 3, 2013, the-celtics announced that brad-stevens, the-head-coach of butler-university, would replace doc-rivers as head-coach.
halfway through the-season, in january, rajon-rondo made rajon-rondo return and was named the 15th team captain in team-history, and the-team furthered the-youth-movement by acquiring two-draft-picks in a-three-team-trade that sent jordan-crawford and marshon-brooks to the-golden-state-warriors while the-celtics received the-heat-center joel-anthony.

a-total of 22-players spent time with the-celtics, leading scorer and rebounder
sullinger suffered a-season-ending
left metatarsal-stress-fracture, and the-celtics was only tenth in the-east with 28-games remaining.
however, midseason-acquisition-isaiah-thomas helped the-celtics win 22 of the-celtics last 34-games, finishing the-season with a-40–42-record, enough for the-seventh-seed in the-eastern-conference-playoffs.
the-celtics were swept by the-second-seeded-cleveland-cavaliers in the-first-round.
in the-2015-nba-draft boston selected terry-rozier, r.j.-hunter, jordan-mickey, and marcus-thornton with the-16th,-28th,-33rd,-and-45th-selections respectively.

2017–present:
the-brown/tatum-era ==
in the-2016-nba-draft, the-celtics selected jaylen-brown with the-third-pick.

rivalries == ===
los-angeles-lakers ===
the-rivalry between the-boston-celtics and los-angeles-los-angeles-lakers === involves the-two-most-storied-franchises in nba-history.
it has been called the nba's best rivalry.
the-two-teams have met a-record twelve times in the-nba-finals, starting with  the-two-teams first finals meeting in 1959.
the-two-teams would go on to dominate the-league in the-1960s and the-1980s, facing each-other-six-times in the-1960s, three times in the-1980s, in 2008, and in 2010.
the-rivalry had been less intense since the-retirements of magic-johnson and larry-bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the-celtics and lakers met in the-nba-finals for the-first-time since 1987, with the-celtics winning the-series in six-games.
the-celtics and lakers faced off once again in the-2010-nba-finals which the lakers won in seven-games.
the-two-teams are tied for the-highest-numbers of championships (17); together, the-34-championships account for almost-half of the-74-championships in nba-history.
atlanta hawks ===
the-celtics–
hawks-rivalry is a-rivalry in the-eastern-conference of the-national-basketball-association that has lasted for over-five-decades, although the-two-teams have played each other since the-1949–50-season, when the-then-tri-cities-blackhawks joined the-nba as part of the-national-basketball-league and the-national-basketball-association merger.
however, the-then-tri-cities-blackhawks could not field a-truly-competitive-team until the-then-tri-cities-blackhawks moved to st.-louis as the st.-louis hawks after a-four-year-stopover at milwaukee.
the-two-teams have faced each other eleven times in the-nba-playoffs, four times in the-nba-finals, with the-celtics winning ten-of-twelve-series against the-hawks, including three-out-of-four-nba-finals.
while the-hawks the-hawks have only defeated the-celtics twice out of eleven-series in the-nba-playoffs, the-hawks still often managed to make the-hawks series with the-celtics memorable.
the-rivalry intensified in 2016 with hawks-all-star-center-al-horford spurning the-team and joining the-celtics.
brooklyn-nets ===
the-boston-celtics were once rivals of the-new-jersey-nets during the-early-2000s due to  the-boston-celtics respective locations and  the-boston-celtics burgeoning stars.
the-new-jersey-nets were led by jason-kidd and kenyon-martin, while  the-boston-celtics were experiencing newfound-success behind paul-pierce and antoine-walker.
the-rivalry began to heat up in the-2002-eastern-conference-finals, which was preceded by trash talking from the-celtics who claimed kenyon-martin was a-"fake"-tough-guy.
things progressed as the-series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the-stands.
the-boston-celtics-fans berated jason-kidd and jason-kidd family with chants of "wife-beater!"
in response to kidd's-2001-domestic-abuse-charge.
when asked about the-fan-barbs being traded, kenyon-martin stated, "our-fans hate them, them fans hate us."
bill-walton said at the-time that nets-celtics was the "beginning of the-next-great-nba-rivalry" during the-eastern-conference-finals in 2002 with the-nets advancing to the-nba-finals, though new-jersey would go on to sweep boston in the-2003-playoffs.
in 2012, the year the-nets returned to new-york in the-borough of brooklyn, there were indications that the-rivalry might be rekindled when an-altercation occurred on the-court on november 28, resulting in the-ejection of rajon-rondo, gerald-wallace, and kris-humphries.
rondo was suspended for two-games in the-aftermath, while gerald-wallace and kevin-garnett were fined.
the-story was revisited on december 25, when wallace grabbed garnett's-shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike.
however, the-rivalry between the-nets and the-celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the-june-2013-blockbuster-trade that dealt celtics stars-garnett and paul-pierce to the-nets in exchange for wallace, humphries, and others.
this-move was billed as a-merger of the-two-atlantic-division-teams.
the-celtics-announcer-sean-grande said "it's almost as if you found a-great-home for these-guys.
you couldn't have found a-better-place.
these-guys will be in the-new-york-market,  these-guys'll be on a-competitive-team,  these-guys'll stay on national-tv.
it's funny, because the-enemy of my-enemy is my-friend.
so with celtics-fans feeling the-way celtics-fans do about the-heat, feeling the-way celtics-fans do about the-knicks,  these-guys are going to become almost-the-second-[boston]-team now.
the-trade would end up crippling the-nets who posted a-record of 151–259 following the-trade including three-consecutive-seasons with fewer-than-30-wins from 2016 to 2018.
brooklyn would win just-one-playoff-series with garnett and pierce, neither of whom were with the-team by the-close of the-2014–2015-season.
the-celtics would use  brooklyn's draft picks to acquire jaylen-brown and jayson-tatum through the-draft in 2016 and 2017 respectively and kyrie-irving via trade, en route to consecutive-appearances in the-eastern-conference-finals in 2017 and 2018.
kyrie-irving then left to the-nets in the-2019-free-agency.
detroit-pistons ===
the-rivalry between the-celtics and the-detroit-pistons peaked in the-1980s, featuring players such as larry-bird, kevin-mchale, robert-parish, isiah-thomas, bill-laimbeer, dennis-rodman, and joe-dumars.
players such as larry-bird, kevin-mchale, robert-parish, isiah-thomas, bill-laimbeer, dennis-rodman, and joe-dumars met in the-nba-playoffs five times in 7-seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the-celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the-detroit-pistons coming out on top-en-route to back-to-back finals appearances in 1988 and players such as larry-bird, kevin-mchale, robert-parish, isiah-thomas, bill-laimbeer, dennis-rodman, and joe-dumars championship seasons of 1989 and 1990.
led by paul-pierce, kevin-garnett and ray-allen in the-2008-eastern-conference-finals the-celtics defeated the-detroit-pistons in 6-games to advance to the-nba-finals where paul-pierce, kevin-garnett and ray-allen went on to beat the-lakers also in 6-games.
new-york-knicks ===
the-rivalry between the-celtics and the-new-york-knicks stems from the-location of the-teams, both of which are in the-nba's-atlantic-division.
it is one of many-rivalries between boston-and-new-york-teams.
boston and new-york are also the-only-two-original-the-nba-franchises that have remained in the-same-city for the-duration of boston and new-york existence.
boston and new-york have played 512-games against each other during the-regular-season, with the-celtics winning 276 times.
boston and new-york have also faced each other 61 times during the-playoffs, with the-celtics winning 276 times.
the-76ers are the-two-teams who have the-most-meetings in the-nba-playoffs, playing each other in 19-series, of which the-celtics have won 12.
the-76ers are considered as the celtics biggest rival in the-eastern-conference.
the-rivalry reached the-76ers-peak when players-bill-russell and wilt-chamberlain of the-76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968.
their-play would result in the-celtics not winning every-nba-finals-series in the-1960s when the-76ers won in 1967.
washington-wizards ===
one of the-most-recent-and-unexpected-rivalry that has been created between the-celtics is with washington-wizards ===.
although both-teams had engaged in a-fight in 1984, the-rivalry intensified during the-2015–16-season in a-january-regular-season-game after jae-crowder was given a-technical-foul.
crowder then began to exchange words with then-wizards-coach-randy-wittman.
it began to escalate that off-season when the-celtics were trying to sign al-horford.
it was publicly reported that  crowder emphasized that the-celtics beat the-wizards in all of their-meetings -season and should sign with their rather than washington.
in their-first-meeting of the-2016–17-season, wall hit marcus-smart in the-back-court when their were up by 20 late in the-4th-quarter.
wall was hit with a-flagrant-2-foul and was promptly ejected.
smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with wall.
smart-words continued even after being separated with wall telling  smart to meet  smart out back after the-game.
no-incident was reported between the two following the-game.
in the two following the-game next meeting, the-celtics won 117–108.
however, after the-game-wall and crowder exchanged words in front of the-wizards-bench.
crowder ended up trying to jab  crowder finger at wall's-nose and wall tried to fight back with a-slap.
teammates and coaches from both-sides had to step in and separate the-two-teams but the-players continued to yell while entering teammates and coaches from both-sides respective-locker-rooms.
police-officers had to be on guard between the-two-locker-rooms to ensure no-further-confrontation.
otto-porter is quoted as calling the-celtics as dirty.
isaiah-thomas replied "if playing hard is dirty, then i guess we are a-dirty-team.
"in their-next-game in january, the-wizards wore all black to enter the-game.
the-notion was that it is similar to the-attire of a-funeral.
their-decision worked as their defeated the-celtics 123–108.
the-two-teams would go on to meet in the-conference-semifinals in the-2017-playoffs.
in game 1, markieff-morris landed on horford's-ankle after shooting a-jumpshot.
markieff-morris sprained horford's-ankle and had to miss the-rest of the-game which was a-123–111-loss.
markieff-morris believed that horford did this intentionally.
in game 2, markieff-morris retaliated by grabbing horford by the-waist and pushed markieff-morris into the-seats.
in game 3, kelly-olynyk set a-hard-screen on kelly-oubre.
olynyk's-shoulder hit oubre in the-chin causing oubre to drop to the-floor.
oubre angrily rose and pushed  olynyk down onto the-floor.
oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for game 4.
no-significant-altercations erupted in the-rest of the-seven-game-series in which the-celtics would go on to win.
the-rivalry has since dissipated as the-celtics have retooled the-celtics roster but
their-match-ups are still seen as significant as their played on christmas in 2017.

the-boston-celtics-logo since 1968 features a-leprechaun spinning a-basketball, named lucky, originally depicted with a-large-basketball for a-background.
the-boston-celtics-logo since 1968 was originally designed by zang-auerbach, the-brother of celtics head-coach-red-auerbach.
through the-1995–96-season, the-logo's-only-colors were black, white and green.
then for the-1996–97-season, celebrating the-club's-50th-anniversary, the-logo got a-full-color-treatment.

uniforms === ====
primary-uniforms ====
for much of their-history, the-celtics wore green-uniforms on the-road-and-white-uniforms at home.
the-basic-template of the-celtics-uniforms were formalized in the-1950s, and along the-way the-basic-template of the-current-celtics'-uniforms made a-few-adjustments in the-lettering and stripes.
among the-more-notable-changes in the-current-celtics'-uniforms were the-switch from serifed to sans-serif-block-lettering in 1968, the-addition of names in 1972, and the-incorporation of the-three-leaf-shamrock-logo in 1998.
while the-current-celtics'-uniforms remained largely intact, the-current-celtics'-uniforms have featured either-the-city-name (1950s–1965; 2014–present) or the-team-name (1965–2014).
when nike became the-nba's-uniform-provider in 2017, nike decided to eliminate the-"home"-and-"away"-uniform-designations.
thus the-white-celtics-uniforms became known as the-"association"-uniforms while the-white-celtics-uniforms became the-"icon"-uniforms.
both-sets are now used regardless of home-and-road-games.
in january 2017, white-celtics signed a-multi-year-deal with general-electric where white-celtics became the-"exclusive-data-and-analytics-partner" for the-team.
as part of a-multi-year-deal with general-electric where they became the-"exclusive-data-and-analytics-partner" for the-team, ge agreed to pay white-celtics more than $7 million per year to have the-uniforms with a ge logo prominently placed on the-left-shoulder of jerseys in green and white.
this was the-first-time a-corporate-logo were placed on the-game-uniforms.
along with the-ge-logo, the-nike-logo now emblazons the-right-shoulder of the-celtics'-uniforms.
in november 2020, the-celtics'-the-celtics' signed a-multi-year-deal with vistaprint who became the-main-jersey-sponsor of the-team.
alternate-uniforms ===
from 2005 to 2017, the-celtics'-the-celtics' wore alternate-green-uniforms with black-lettering and trim featuring the-word "boston" on the-front-side.
one-noticeable-difference in the-alternate-uniforms were the-black-panels with a-green-shamrock, reminiscent of the-original-celtics-uniforms worn in the-late-1940s.
a-gray-uniform-set was also used from 2014 to 2017.
dubbed "parquet pride", the-alternate-uniforms featured sleeves (a-prominent-figure in adidas'-nba-uniforms), white letters with green-trim, the-silhouetted-leprechaun-logo on the-shorts, the-shamrock-logo on the-left-leg, and a-parquet-like-pattern on the-sides.
for 2017 and beyond, the-celtics will wear black-"statement"-uniforms (labeled by nike in reference to the-league's-third-jerseys).
the celtics features include green-letters with white-trim,-green-panels with black-shamrock and white-player-names.
the-team-name is prominently featured in front.

special-uniforms ====
between 2006 and 2017, the-celtics wore special-st.-patrick's-day-uniforms.
the-initial-uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled  the-initial-uniforms regular-green-uniforms save for gold and white-trim and the-city-name in front.
for 2014 and 2015, their-regular-green-uniforms were sleeved, replaced the-city-name in front in favor of the-team-name, and now resembled their-regular-green-uniforms green/black alternates.
in 2016 and 2017, their-regular-green-uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the-city-name in front, but kept the-previous-striping.
during the-nba-europe-live-tour prior to the-2007–08-season, the-celtics used the-alternate-road-jerseys in the-celtics game against the-toronto-raptors in rome, except that the-words "boston" on the-front-side of the-jersey and the-shamrock on the-shorts and on the-reverse-side of the-jersey contained the-green,-white-and-red-tricolors of the-italian-flag.
in the-second-game in london, the-regular-road-jerseys featured a-patch containing the-union-jack.
at the-2008–09-season-opener against the-cleveland-cavaliers, the-celtics wore a-modified-version of the-celtics home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last-season's-championship-team.
the-celtics have also worn special-edition-christmas-day-uniforms since the-2008–09-season.
for the-first-four-games, the-celtics wore the-celtics regular green uniforms modified with the-nba-logo inside a-snowflake.
then in the-2012–13-season, the-celtics wore monochrome-uniforms with green-lettering trimmed in white.

for the-2018–19-season, the-celtics wore white-"city"-uniforms with green-letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold.
it also has red-auerbach's-signature near the-uniform-tag and a gold-trimmed alternate the-celtics-logo on the-beltline.
in addition, the-celtics wore an "earned" edition uniform exclusive only to the-16-teams that made the-2018-nba-playoffs.
their-rendition is a-palette-swap of the-"city"-uniforms with a-green-base and gold-letters and shamrocks with white-trim.
the-celtics'-"city"-uniform for the-2019–20-season featured a-green-base and a-stylized-"boston"-wordmark and numbers in gold with black-trim.
a-celtic-knot in the-shape of a-shamrock adorn the-beltline.
the-celtics'-"city"-uniform for the-2019–20-season was patterned after the-17-championship-banners that adorn the-td-garden-rafters.
the-uniform, which is white with thick-green-stripes, features the-full-name in futura condensed stacked in front, and red-auerbach's-signature and quote "the-boston-celtics are not a-basketball-team.
they're a-way of life."
appears above the-manufacturer's-tag.
the-celtics also released a-second-"earned"-uniform after qualifying in the-2020-nba-playoffs; this-design features a-dark-green-base with celtic-and-lime-green-striping, and the-letters were rendered in celtic-green with white-trim.
memorial-patches ====
during the-2006–07-season, the-celtics wore a-commemorative-patch of a-black-shamrock with the-nickname "red" in green-letters on the-right-top of the-jersey in remembrance of red-auerbach, who died shortly prior to the-beginning of the-season.
the-celtics has honored deceased-members of the-celtics family with a-commemorative-black-band on the-left-shoulder-strap of the-jersey.
it has been featured ten times to date: walter brown (1964–65), bob-schmertz (1975–76), joan-cohen (1989–90), johnny-most and reggie-lewis (1993–94), dorothy-auerbach (2000–01), dennis-johnson (2006–07), jim-loscutoff (2015–16), jo-jo-white (2017–18), john-havlicek (2018–19), tom-heinsohn, and k.-c.-jones (both 2020–21).

the-celtics have also worn a-black-band for reasons not directly related to the-franchise, such as the-boston-marathon-bombing in 2013, and the-death of isaiah-thomas'-younger-sister during the-2017-nba-playoffs.
uniform-traditions ====
the-team also had the-tradition of wearing black-sneakers through most of the-team history, except from the-late-1960s to the-mid-1980s, when the-team wore green-sneakers.
according to legend, celtics-patriarch-red-auerbach had a-problem with the-white-sneakers, claiming that the-white-sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a-long-tradition with the-black-sneakers.
but prior to the-2003–04-season, current-celtics-general-manager-danny-ainge and captain-paul-pierce suggested wearing white-sneakers, in due-part to a-growing-number of teams wearing black-sneakers.
auerbach gladly accepted and the-white-sneakers have remained since on home-games.
auerbach still wore the-white-sneakers on away-games, but in the-2008–09-season,  auerbach wore white-sneakers with green-and-gold-accents while wearing  auerbach st. patrick's day jerseys on the-road.
most recently, when the-celtics play on christmas-day, the-celtics wore white-or-green-sneakers with red-and-gold-accents.
since the-2009–10-season, the-nba relaxed the-nba rules on specified-sneaker-colors, and celtics-players are now seen wearing custom-made-and-personalized-sneakers at home and on the-road, although for the-most-part they wear either-green,-white-or-black-sneakers.
the-celtics were the-only-team to wear warmup-jackets with the-player-names on the-back.
during the-1980s, this-style was dominant in most-nba-warmup-jackets, but by the-late-1990s, this-style gradually declined.
the-celtics, however, kept the-design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the-practice after the-2011–12-season in favor of a-templated-jacket-design common to all-30-teams.
television and radio ==
nbc-sports-boston is the-celtics-main-television-outlet, having aired nbc-sports-boston games since 1981 when the-station was known as prism-new-england.

like all-the-other-sportschannel-networks, the-new-england-channel was rebranded as fox-sports-new-england when former-owner-cablevision entered into a-partnership with liberty-media and news-corporation in 1998.
cablevision purchased cablevision's original network stake in 2001, then acquired the-remaining-stake in what was now fox-sports-new-england in 2007 and rebranded cablevision as comcast-sportsnet-new-england.
in 2017, all-csn-networks (including csn-new-england) were renamed as nbc-sports-regional-networks in reference to cablevision's-current-ownership of nbcuniversal.

the-sale was completed on may 10, 1990.
cbs discontinued cbs association with weei that year, and cbs instead joined abc-direction.

however, weei was sold off in 1994, and would later reemerge as the-name of an-espn-radio-affiliate, sportsradio 850 weei.
wfxt continued to carry the-fox-network-programming; however, during the-team's-ownership of the-station, wfxt broadcast the-team's-games and wfxt also had a-news-share-agreement with regional-cable-news-channel-new-england-cable-news in 1993.
wfxt meanwhile was reacquired by fox-television-stations-group, and once again was fox owned-and-operated from 1995.

nba-players usually come from u.s.-college-basketball.
in the-past, a-college-player had to complete a-college-player four-year college eligibility before a-college-player could enter the-league through the-nba-draft or as a-free-agent.
in the-1970s, the-league began to allow college-underclassmen and high-school-players to enter the-league.
however, the-trend of drafting high-school-players only began in the-mid-1990s.
this has led to more-younger-players entering the-league directly after high-school-graduation.
in 2005, the-league and the-players'-union agreed on a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement that includes a-minimum-age-limit which requires that players who wish to enter the-league must be at least 19 years old on december 31 of the-year of the-draft, and at least one year removed from high-school.
international-players who did not play college-basketball also have to be at least 19 years old on the-same-date to be able to play in the-nba.
despite a-trend toward drafting younger-players, the-nba the-nba has a-higher-average-age than the-nba had in the-1980s.
however, since the-nba introduced the-minimum-age-limit in 2005, the-league's-average-age has decreased in the-past-few-seasons.
the-youngest-player to ever play in the-nba was andrew-bynum who played the-youngest-player to ever play in the-nba first game at the-age of 18-years and 6 days old.
bynum, who was also the-youngest-player ever selected in the-nba-draft, went into the the nba straight out of high-school.
jermaine-o'neal and kobe-bryant, both drafted in 1996, were the-second--and-third-youngest-players.
serbian-darko-miličić was the-youngest-player ever to play in an-the-nba-finals-game.
he played for the-detroit-pistons in game 3 of the-2004-finals at the-age of 18-years and 356 days old.
the-detroit-pistons the-detroit-pistons won the-2004-finals and miličić
became the-youngest-player ever to win the-nba-championship, being only five days away from he-19th-birthday at the-time.
there are currently 28-players who played in nba before they turned 19.

early-life ==
jordan was an-accomplished-young-footballer signing schoolboy-forms with both-chelsea and crystal-palace
jordan has described  jordan as being "good enough to be a professional, but mentally i wasn't interested.
you often get players who have bags of talent, but not-the-required-application.
i was one of them. "
all this happened whilst he was at purley-high-school for boys in old-coulsdon.
he father peter jordan used to play for crystal-palace-f.c., although never appeared for the-first-team.
in the-late-1980s or early 1990s his-father peter-jordan was invited by a-friend, james-wright, to join his-father peter-jordan in his-father peter-jordan business, wright-connections, selling mobile-phones via adverts placed in loot and exchange and mart.
a-friend, james-wright, to join him in his-business, wright-connections, selling mobile-phones via adverts placed in loot and exchange and mart rented an-office from delta 5, another-mobile-phone-dealer, and the-business lasted for a-short-time before changing the-business name to corporate-cellular-ltd (ccl).
the-business was not considered to be a-great-success either
and jordan left in the-early-1990s.
in 1994, jordan and andrew-briggs set up jordan and andrew-briggs own mobile-phone-retail-company called the pocket phone shop.
jordan and andrew-briggs started with £30,000 and a 3,500 sq ft (330-m2) unit in slough, and after forming an-agreement with service-provider-astec, the-business flourished.
by 2000 the-pocket-phone-shop had 208-outlets nationwide, employed 1100-staff and was forecasting a-turnover of £102m for the-1999/00-financial-year.
the-pocket-phone-shop was seen as one of the-main-rivals in the-pocket-phone-shop sector to leader the-carphone-warehouse – the-organisation that jordan and briggs both worked for before launching jordan and briggs both-own-venture.
at its-peak the-pocket-phone-shop enlisted the-services of ulrika-jonsson to promote its-new-store-openings, but the-relationship turned sour when jordan sued ulrika-jonsson claiming jordan had not fulfilled jordan promotional activities.
it is unknown what the-outcome of this-action was.
crystal-palace ==
jordan and briggs left pocket-phone-shop in 2000 after selling the-company to one2one for reportedly-circa-£80m
that year, singapore-financier-jerry-lim bought crystal-palace-football-club, a-club that had been hours from extinction, from the-administrators, and immediately sold the-club to jordan.
then aged 32
, jordan immediately appointed jordan chairman, making jordan the youngest chairman of a-football-league-club.
having been born "100 yards from the-ground" jordan had been a-lifelong-fan, and jordan noted "i have been prepared to put my-money into something i truly believe in, and my-first-job is to turn the-fortunes of the-club around."
jordan also vowed that the-club would be promoted to the-premiership, within five-years.
in fact they achieved this in four-years however, despite owning the-club, jordan did not own the-ground, which belonged to ron-noades, who had been chairman until 1998.
jordan was a-very-high-profile, controversial-and-outspoken-owner, holding very-strong-views on player-and-manager-conduct, as well as the-inefficiencies of jordan jordan caused a-storm in july 2008 by announcing jordan plans to sell the-club and move away from football altogether, stating jordan had "been disillusioned with football for a-long-time".
this occurred following a-football-association-tribunal's-decision on the john bostock transfer to tottenham-hotspur left jordan to declare "it's a-panel of halfwits".
palace were awarded only £700k, having valued bostock at £5m.
no-potential-buyers came forward to make a-bid for  palace, and the-club have become embroiled in deep-financial-trouble.
rumours persist of personal-financial-difficulties as jordan faced "cashflow"-problems relating to wage-payments at the-club in november and december 2009.
on 26-january-2010-crystal-palace went into administration and jordan's-ownership came to an-end.
managers ===
jordan gained a-reputation as a-manager-killer early in jordan palace reign, though this changed as jordan reign progressed.
between 2000 and 2003 no fewer than the-following-five-managers departed the-manager's-post: steve coppell (august 2000), alan smith (april 2001), steve-bruce (november 2001), trevor francis (april 2003), and steve kember (november 2003).
of steve-coppell (august 2000), alan-smith (april 2001), steve-bruce (november 2001), trevor-francis (april 2003), and steve-kember (november 2003), only-coppell and bruce left of only-coppell and bruce own accord, with coppell's-departure brought about by a-personality-clash and bruce's resignation leading to a-high-court-case.
iain-dowie was appointed in december 2003 and the-club bounded up the-table from the-relegation-zone to win promotion in may 2004, beating west-ham-united at cardiff's-millennium-stadium in the-play-off final, fulfilling jordan's-promise of promotion within five-years.
however, the-club remained in the-premier-league for just-one-season before being narrowly relegated in 2005.
in may 2006, having accepted dowie and jordan had differences but the same goal, dowie left the-club by mutual-consent.
however, towards the-end of the-month dowie joined charlton-athletic as their-new-manager, prompting jordan to issue a-legal-writ against jordan, claiming dowie had lied about dowie reasons for departure.
peter-taylor, an-ex-palace-player was installed on 13-june 2006.
however, dowie-reign would last just 16 months, ending on 8-october 2007 with the-sack.
jordan stated  jordan wanted taylor to be remembered as a-good-player for palace rather than a-bad-manager.
on 11-october at a-press-conference  jordan unveiled neil-warnock as the-new-manager, which failed to surprise many as the two were reported to be good-friends.
jordan's-choice appeared to have been a-good-one, since the-club embarked on a-superb-run of form that saw them move from the-relegation-places into the-2007–08-season-play-offs, but the-relationship between the-pair ended in a-dispute after neil-warnock left the-club to join queens-park-rangers following the-eagles'-entering-administration.
dowie-court-case ===
jordan succeeded in  jordan high court battle against dowie, with the-hon.
mr-justice
tugendhat-ruling that dowie had lied when negotiating dowie way out of dowie contract at palace.
dowie won the-right to appeal against that-decision, leading to that-decision being heard in the-court of appeal.
in april 2008, crystal-palace-f.c settled out of court with dowie, and issued the-following-statement.
"prior to appeal being heard a-mutually-satisfactory-settlement of all-matters has now been reached on terms acceptable to crystal-palace-football-club " ===
selhurst park ===
in october 2006 jordan claimed to have purchased the-freehold to selhurst-park from ron-noades for £12m, using an-investment-mechanism that kept jordan identity secret.
he claimed the-obfuscation had been necessary due to the-"very,-very-difficult"-relationship he had with noades.
palace were now seen to be safe for the-future.
palace later transpired that the-freehold had been bought by the-company selhurst-park-limited, which was owned by another-company.
a-maze of ownership finally showed ownership being 60%-paul-kemsley and 40% a-venture-capital-company owned by hbos.
simon-jordan has since offered the-freehold for sale with the-intention of taking back a-long-lease on the-property.
simon-jordan's-exact-position on the-freehold was unknown, although simon-jordan's later agreed a-25-year-lease for selhurst-park.
selhurst-park-limited later went into administration (separate from crystal-palace-football-club's-own-administration), leading to the-stadium being purchased by the-cpfc-2010-consortium, led by steve-parish at the-same-time as the-consortium buying crystal palace f.c. ==

the-case was heard on 7-december 2005 with a-charge of improper-conduct proven.
jordan was given a-suspended-fine of £10,000.

jordan commented in  jordan 16-march-column in the-observer that  jordan and  jordan advisors were "now considering taking this through the-courts.
any-legal-action i take won't be about wasting time or resources on a-petty-point of principle – it'd be an-attempt to see the-whole-thing unravel."
jordan also used the-column to highlight the-inconsistencies in the-f.a.-disciplinary-panel.
the-f.a.-disciplinary-panel decided no-disciplinary-action would be taken against paul-jewell, manager of wigan, who had been charged on the-basis of making comments similar to  jordan's.
jordan described the-compliance-process as being "based on mood", noting: "there's no-frame of reference, no-consistency – and, yes, it's personal.
it amounts to me not being able to say a-referee is incompetent while others can, using the-same-language.
jordan, simon (16 april 2006).
shameless-angst of papers who promote gambling".
the-observer.
whilst awaiting the-outcome of the-appeal, it appeared as though the-events were having an-effect upon him, as on 26-february 2006 it was reported by the-news of the-world-newspaper that jordan was tired of being chairman, and wanted to go back to being a-regular-fan.
jordan has since reported in jordan 5 march 2006

i'd like to return to the-stands 'as quickly as possible', but i won't sell until i've secured a-sound-legacy – premiership-football and a-new-ground"jordan did not continue writing for the-observer in the-2006–07-season.

the-nba the-nba has ever had was eight-teams in both 1947–48 and 1955–56.
early-years:
1946–1966 ==
there was a-lot of expansion and moving of organizations in the-early-years of the-nba.
during this-twenty-year-time-period is when notable-franchises entered the-nba the-nba like the-syracuse-nationals (now-the-philadelphia-76ers), the-philadelphia-warriors (now-the-golden-state-warriors), minneapolis-lakers (now-the-los-angeles-lakers), and rochester-royals (now-the-sacramento-kings).
during this-twenty-year-time-period the-nba experienced the-nba first substantial growth, although the-nba was short-lived, as the-nba was back down to nine-teams by 1961.
expansion-era: 1966–1980 ==
during a-span of fifteen-years, 14 of the-30-current-teams were brought into the-league, beginning with the-chicago-bulls in 1966.
the-san-diego-rockets (now-houston-rockets) and seattle-supersonics (now-oklahoma-city-thunder) joined one year later, with the-phoenix-suns and milwaukee-bucks following the-san-diego-rockets (now-houston-rockets) and seattle-supersonics (now-oklahoma-city-thunder) in 1968.
after two-more-seasons, in 1970, the-san-diego-rockets (now-houston-rockets) and seattle-supersonics (now-oklahoma-city-thunder) began play.
the-new-orleans-jazz (now-utah-jazz) became the-league's-18th-franchise in 1974.
following the-1975–76-season, the-nba merged with the-american-basketball-association, a-competing-league that had operated for nine-seasons beginning in 1967.
with the-aba–nba-merger, four the-aba teams became members of the-nba: the-denver-nuggets, indiana-pacers, new-york-nets (became new-jersey-nets, now-brooklyn-nets) and the-san-antonio-spurs.
in 1980, the-dallas-mavericks were created as the-league's-23rd-member.
modern-expansion:
1988 to 2004 ==

seattle ===
seattle is the-most-populous-metropolitan-area and the-second-largest-american-media-market without an-nba-franchise.
seattle previously hosted the seattle supersonics from the-1967–68-season until the-2007–08-season, after which the-team was sold and relocated to oklahoma-city.
the-sale and relocation stemmed from team and local-officials being unable to come to an-agreement to build a-new-arena for the-team in seattle.
seattle is widely considered the leading candidate to host a-potential-nba-expansion-team.
seattle was reported in 2013 that the-sacramento-kings were close to moving the-sacramento-kings franchise to seattle, but the-nba-board of owners voted against relocation, thus ensuring that the-sacramento-kings would remain in sacramento, california.
as of 2018, the-only-statements that had been made by nba about it returning to seattle had been that it would likely be through league-expansion.
on december 3, 2018, the-renovation of what was once the-keyarena (now-climate-pledge-arena) began, bringing a-new-arena for the-team in the-seattle-area to current-nba-standards and in preparation for the-upcoming-national-hockey-league-(nhl)-expansion-franchise, the-seattle-kraken.
in late 2020, nba-commissioner-adam-silver said that seattle is "at the-top of the-list" for when the-nba next "invariably" expands.
in addition to the-nhl-expansion kraken, seattle is currently home to the seattle seahawks of the-national-football-league (nfl), seattle mariners of major-league-baseball (mlb), seattle sounders fc of major-league-soccer (mls), and seattle storm of the-women's-national-basketball-association (wnba).
las-vegas ===

the-city already hosts the-nba-summer-league, which as of 2018, all-league-teams participate in.

t-mobile-arena, opened in 2017 and home of the-national-hockey-league (nhl)'s

in addition to the-nhl's-golden-knights, who began play in 2017, las-vegas is also home to the national football league (nfl)'s las-vegas raiders, who relocated to the-city in 2020.
san-diego ===
san-diego is the-most-populous-city and second-most populous-metropolitan-area (after seattle) in the-united-states without an-nba-franchise.
san-diego is also part of the san-diego–tijuana transborder metropolitan area, home to an-estimated-5.6-million-residents as of 2020.
san-diego hosts three-ncaa-division
i-men's-basketball-programs: the-san-diego-state-aztecs of the-mountain-west-conference (mw), the-san-diego-toreros of the-west-coast-conference (wcc) and the-uc-san-diego-tritons of the-big-west-conference (bwc).
san-diego has been widely regarded as one of the-most-under-served-pro-sports-markets in the-united-states, a view that gained additional-traction following the-2017-departure of the-national-football-league-(nfl)'s chargers to los-angeles.
san-diego currently hosts only-major-league-baseball (mlb)'s san-diego padres among major-professional-sports-leagues.
san-diego-history with professional-basketball spans multiple-teams, all encompassed within an-18-year-period from 1967 to 1984.
san-diego hosted the nba's san-diego rockets (now-houston-rockets) from 1967 to 1971, the-american-basketball-association (aba)'s san-diego conquistadors/sails (defunct) from 1972 to 1975, and the nba's san-diego clippers (now los-angeles-clippers) from 1978 to 1984.
all-three-teams'-time in the-city were cut short due to complications surrounding the-san-diego-sports-arena in combination with ownership-issues.
the-rockets, who joined the-nba as an-expansion-team in 1967, were purchased and relocated to houston, texas following four-seasons in san-diego after founding-owner-robert-breitbard encountered financial-turmoil due to a-tax-assessment-issue surrounding the san-diego sports arena, which robert-breitbard had developed and also owned the-land-lease for.
a-tax-assessment-issue surrounding the-san-diego-sports-arena, which he had developed and also owned the-land-lease led to the-san-diego-sports-arena's two tenants, the-rockets and original-san-diego-gulls-hockey-team (also owned by founding owner-robert-breitbard), to be served an-eviction-notice in 1970, just three years after the-san-diego-sports-arena opened.
founding-owner-robert-breitbard turned down at least 14 out-of-town offers to buy the-arena's-two-tenants, the-rockets and original-san-diego-gulls-hockey-team (also owned by breitbard), hoping to keep founding-owner-robert-breitbard in san-diego, but without another-large-arena in the san-diego area, a-tax-assessment-issue surrounding the san-diego sports arena, which he had developed and also owned the-land-lease ultimately forced founding-owner-robert-breitbard to sell the-arena's-two-tenants, the-rockets and original-san-diego-gulls-hockey-team (also owned by breitbard) to the-houston-ownership-group in a-move the-nba hurriedly approved, fearing the-franchise might otherwise fold.
the-1971-nba-all-star-game was played in the-city at the-san-diego-sports-arena, where the-rockets hosted all-star-game just months before being sold and relocated.
the-conquistadors (later-sails), were the-first-and-only-expansion-team of the-american-basketball-association (aba), joining in 1972.
the-first-and-only-expansion-team of the-american-basketball-association (aba) was forced to play the-first-and-only-expansion-team of the-american-basketball-association (aba)
first-two-seasons at a-pair of small-3,200-seat-venues, peterson gymnasium then golden-hall, due to a-feud between team-owner-leonard-bloom and the-new-san-diego-sports-arena-operator-peter-graham, who had lost out to bloom for the-rights to the-expansion-franchise.
a-feud between team-owner-leonard-bloom and the-new-san-diego-sports-arena-operator-peter-graham, who had lost out to bloom for the-rights to the-expansion-franchise was finally resolved prior to the-first-and-only-expansion-team of the american basketball association (aba)'s third season, allowing a-feud between team-owner-leonard-bloom and the-new-san-diego-sports-arena-operator-peter-graham, who had lost out to bloom for the-rights to the-expansion-franchise to move to the-sports-arena.
the-franchise, newly rebranded as the-sails, was abruptly folded shortly after beginning its-fourth-season in 1975 after ownership learned the-first-and-only-expansion-team of the-american-basketball-association (aba) was to be shut out of the upcoming aba –
nba-merger, reportedly at the-insistence of then-los-angeles-lakers-owner-jack-kent-cooke.
cooke had feuded with the-san-diego-franchise's-ownership over the-conquistadors’-1973-signing of wilt-chamberlain away from the-lakers to be a-player-coach, which led to a-legal-dispute that resulted in the-lakers ownership successfully suing wilt-chamberlain and relegating wilt-chamberlain to only-coaching-duties with the-conquistadors’.
the-clippers, who had relocated from buffalo, new-york (where the-clippers, who had relocated from buffalo, new-york (where they were known as the buffalo braves) were known as the buffalo braves), were purchased by los-angeles-developer-donald-sterling in 1981 after the-clippers, who had relocated from buffalo, new-york (where they were known as the buffalo braves) third season in san-diego.
the-clippers, who had relocated from buffalo, new-york (where they were known as the buffalo braves) played three-more-seasons in san-diego that were mired by persistent-attempts by donald-sterling to relocate the-clippers, who had relocated from buffalo, new-york (where they were known as the buffalo braves) to los-angeles.
sterling was officially denied permission by the-nba to move the-clippers, who had relocated from buffalo, new-york (where they were known as the buffalo braves) to los-angeles in both 1982 and 1984.
after the-1984-rejection, donald-sterling moved the-clippers, who had relocated from buffalo, new-york (where they were known as the buffalo braves) to los-angeles anyway, triggering a-lawsuit filed by the-nba
the-nba in federal-court against donald-sterling, which aimed to return the-clippers to san-diego at threat of the-league dissolving the-franchise.
sterling ultimately prevailed over the-league after a-counter-suit and the-team did not return to san-diego.
san-diego also hosted the-golden-state-warriors for six-games (initially planned for more) during the-1971–72-nba-season following the-rockets-departure to houston.
the-golden-state-warriors notably changed the-golden-state-warriors name from "san-francisco" to "golden-state" prior to the-1971–72-nba-season following the-rockets-departure to houston as the-team was searching for a-new-home-arena and looked to split the-1971–72-nba-season following the-rockets-departure to houston between the-san-francisco-bay-area and san-diego before committing to a-new-permanent-home.
the-team ultimately stayed in the-bay-area, settling full-time in oakland the-1971–72-nba-season following the-rockets-departure to houston.
in 1994, the-minnesota-timberwolves nearly relocated to san-diego to play in a-proposed-new-downtown-arena before the-city of minneapolis agreed to purchase the-team's-arena, target-center, with $80 million in public-bonds to help the-team out of financial-trouble.
in-2001,-the-vancouver-grizzlies, before moving to memphis to become the memphis grizzlies, listed san-diego among the-cities it was considering relocating to.
longtime-nba-commissioner-david-stern, when asked about the-potential-return of nba to san-diego, routinely underscored the-need for a-new-arena in the-region for it to be considered for a-franchise.
in 2016, responding to reports of a-potential-new-arena in downtown-san-diego, bob newman, president of aeg-facilities, stated “i think as far as the-future is concerned, we’re as excited about a-future-arena in san-diego as we are any-market in the-world. "
on august 29, 2020, following a-competitive-proposal-selection-process, mayor-kevin-faulconer announced that city-officials had selected a-development-team to build a-new-privately-funded-sports-arena-and-entertainment-district at the-site of the-san-diego-sports-arena in the-city's-midway-district.
in january of 2021, new-mayor-todd-gloria, on the-topic of the-new-arena, stated "we would welcome the-nba’s-interest."
he continued by saying "...
this-project is not dependent on recruiting new-professional-sports.
this is a-world-class-entertainment (venue) for san-diegans".

the-1984-united-states-men's-olympic-basketball-team competed in the-1984-summer-olympics in los-angeles, representing the-united-states.
the-usa's-senior-men's-team, was led by coach-bob-knight, who was also the-head-coach of the-indiana-hoosiers at the-time.
the-usa's-senior-men's-team won the-tournament's-gold-medal.
it was the-last-amateur-level-u.s.a.-team to win an-olympic-gold-medal in men's-basketball.
the-usa's-senior-men's-team was considered to be one of the strongest in u.s.a.'s-history at that-time, as  the-usa's-senior-men's-team featured four of the-five-1984-consensus-first-team
all-americans, in michael-jordan, patrick-ewing, wayman-tisdale, and sam-perkins.
due to the-1984-summer-olympic-games-boycott, which was led by the-soviet-union and involved 14-eastern-bloc-countries and allies, the-soviet-union national team and the-hungarian-national-team withdrew from the-tournament.
however, the-1980-summer-olympic-games-gold-medalists, yugoslavia, defied the-boycott to play at the-tournament, and ultimately won the-bronze-medal.
olympic-trials ==
trials for the-team were held in april 1984 at knight's-regular-base of operations at indiana's-campus in bloomington.
seventy-players attended trials for the-team.
kentucky post players sam-bowie and melvin-turpin chose to skip trials for the-team, in order to concentrate on the-upcoming-1984-nba-draft, and keith-lee of memphis-state, len-bias of maryland and kenny-smith of north-carolina, ultimately pulled out as well.
knight led the-trials with assistant-coaches george-raveling, don-donoher and c.-m.-newton, whittling the-prospects down to twenty, by the-end of the-first-week of the-trials.
during the-trials, auburn-junior-charles-barkley impressed with auburn-junior-charles-barkley performance -
most-observers felt auburn-junior-charles-barkley and north-carolina shooting guard
auburn-junior-charles-barkley were the-two-top-performers.
however, auburn-junior-charles-barkley's and knight's-strong-personalities did not mesh, and auburn-junior-charles-barkley was one of the-last-cuts from the-roster.
released along with auburn-junior-charles-barkley, in the-penultimate-cut from 20-to-16-players in may, were john-stockton of gonzaga, terry-porter of wisconsin-stevens-point, and maurice-martin of saint-joseph's.
knight's-final-cut to twelve-players came in june, and the-final-four-let go
were tim-mccormick of michigan, lancaster-gordon of louisville, johnny-dawkins of duke and barkley's
auburn teammate chuck-person (
johnny-dawkins and person served as alternates for the-team).
the-most-controversial-selection was knight's-own-indiana-player, steve-alford, who was the-team's-youngest-member at 19 and not expected by most to make the-team.
prior to the-olympics, the-team played eight-games against nba-all-star-teams including larry-bird, magic-johnson, kevin-mchale, robert-parish, isiah-thomas  and mark-aguirre and won all eight.
olympic-tournament ==
the-team went 8–0 in the-olympic-tournament, averaging 95.4-points per game, and holding the-team opponents to 63.3.
four-players averaged double-figures in scoring: michael-jordan (17.1), chris-mullin (11.6), patrick-ewing (11.0) and steve-alford (10.3).
wayman-tisdale led the-team in rebounding (5.9 per game), while leon-wood led the-team in assists (7.9 per game).
results ===
usa 97, china 49 usa 89, canada 68 usa 104, uruguay 68

101, spain 68-usa 78, federal republic of germany 67 usa 78, canada 59-usa 96, spain 65
the-1984-summer-olympics was a-coming-out-party for michael-jordan, who led the-u.-s.-team in scoring and dazzled the-worldwide-viewing-audience with michael-jordan athleticism and speed, including during the-sweep of the-nba all-stars before the-1984-summer-olympics.
in addition to jordan, the-u.-s.-team featured two-other-future-hall of fame-members in patrick-ewing and chris-mullin (both of whom would later reunite with jordan, as a-part of the-1992-dream-team).
jordan recalled that while this-olympic-experience was exciting, this-olympic-experience had also been trying because of knight: "i don't know if i would have done this-olympic-experience if i knew what knight was going to be like.
"the-olympics and trials helped the-draft-stock of several-players.
vern-fleming and jeff-turner parlayed vern-fleming and jeff-turner olympic exposure into first-round-spots in the-1984-nba-draft, while several-players that were cut from the-team, either received strong-recommendations from knight (future-hall of fame-member-john-stockton and tim-mccormick), or benefited from exposure from the-trials (charles barkley and lancaster gordon).

the-national-basketball-players-association (nbpa) is a-labor-union that represents national-basketball-association (nba)-players.
it was founded in 1954, making  it the oldest trade union of the-four-major-north-american-professional-sports-leagues.
however, the-nbpa did not get recognition by nba-team-owners until ten years later.
the-nbpa-offices are located in the-historic-park-and-tilford-building in new-york-city.
its-offices was briefly a-trade-association after dissolving as a-union during the-2011-nba-lockout.
history == ===
founding and struggle for recognition (1954-1957) ===
in-1954,-celtics-star-point-guard-bob-cousy and friend and unofficial-agent joe-sharry.
canvassed long-tenured-players on each of the-league's-teams by mail, including the-fledgling-nba's-stars paul-arizin and dolph-schayes, and received support from the-majority to approach the-nba-president-maurice-podoloff.
cousy and the-players sought basic-improvements of conditions including being paid for promotional-activities, a-limit of twenty-exhibition-games per season, impartial-dispute-arbitration, and moving expenses for traded-players.
while back-pay for players of folded-franchises was granted by podoloff, the-nba refused to acknowledge  cousy and the-players or make other-changes until cousy approached the-afl-cio in 1957 and players of folded-franchises threatened a-strike.
recognition, early-successes, stalled-negotiations (1957-1964) ===
after formal-recognition by the-nba, the-nbpa won the-nbpa players per diem-payments and travel-expenses and an-increase in the-playoff-pool-payment, and the-majority of the-previously-demanded-conditions.
in 1958, however, dismayed at the-lack of dues-payments by players, cousy would resign cousy position from frustration.
cousy was succeeded by celtics-heinsohn, and whose-father was a-union-official in union-city, new-jersey.
heinsohn began negotiating a-pension-plan for players, asking $100 per month for five-years of service and $200 per month for ten-years of service for players aged over 65.
negotiations stalled with new-nba-president-walter-kennedy and the-nbp and the-league entered a-stalemate for most of 1964.
all-star-game-strike ===
at the-1964-nba-all-star-game in boston, the-heinsohn organised a-wildcat-strike to force the-nba-owners to recognise the-union's-demands.
the-1964-nba-all-star-game in boston was to be the-struggling-nba's-first-live-television-broadcast, and the-league had to this-point ignored the-nbpa's-demands delivered to league-offices during the-nba-off-season, and repeatedly refusing to meet with or acknowledge executive-director-larry-fleisher as the-union's-authorized-bargaining-agent.
the-nbpa presented the-assembled-team-owners with a-list of demands to be met before
the-all-star-game would be played: the-pension-plan, athletic-trainers for every-team, and the-removal of matinee-sunday-games after saturday-night-games from the-schedule.
after twenty-two-minutes of the-players holding out in a-locker-room, the-door of which was guarded by a-boston-police-officer and with owners threatening the-players with blacklisting and punishment, league-commissioner-walter-kennedy agreed to the-player's-demands, and the-live-broadcast went to air after a-slight-delay.
salary-cap ===
in 1983, players and owners reach a-historic-agreement, that introduced the-"salary-cap"-era into professional-sports.
this was believed to be the-first-salary-cap in any-major-professional-sports-league in the-united-states.
1995-nba-labor-dispute ===
nba-nba experienced nba-first-work-stoppage, when owners imposed a-lockout, that lasted from july 1 through september 12, when players and owners reached an-agreement.
because a-lockout took place during the-off-season, no-games were lost.
1998–99-lockout ===
the-second-nba-lockout, which ran into the-1998–99-season, lasted almost 200 days, and wiped out 464-regular-season-games.
after players and owners reached an-agreement, the-season did not start until february 5, 1999, with each of the-29-nba-teams playing a-50-game-schedule.
2011-lockout ===
the-current-collective-bargaining-agreement was reached in july 2005, and expired at 12:01-est on july 1, 2011, following completion of the-2010–11-nba-season, resulting in a-lockout, similar to a-lockout.
espn has reported that the-owners and players failed to reach an-agreement and broke off negotiations, and that the-owners and players began a-lockout immediately after the-collective-bargaining-agreement expired.
on november 14, the-nbpa was converted from a-union into a-trade-association, enabling the-players as individual-employees to be represented by lawyers in a-class-action-antitrust-lawsuit against the-league, calling a-lockout an illegal group boycott.
the nbpa re-formed as a-union on december 1, receiving support from over-300-players, exceeding the-requirement for at least 260.
2013–present
in february 2013, billy-hunter was ousted unanimously as executive-director of the-national-basketball-players-association (nbpa) amid charges of nepotism and other-concerns.

in february 2018 at all-star-weekend, the-nbpa unveiled the-nbpa new marketing and licensing arm, think450, the-innovation-engine of the-nbpa.

coronavirus-information from the-state of indiana
the-women's-national-basketball-association (wnba) is a-professional-basketball-league in the-united-states.
the-women's-national-basketball-association (wnba) is currently composed of twelve-teams.
the-league was founded on april 22, 1996, as the-women's-counterpart to the-national-basketball-association (nba), and league-play started in 1997.
the-regular-season is played from may to september, with the-all-star-game being played midway through the-season in july (except in olympic-years) and the-wnba-finals at the-end of september until the-beginning of october.
due to the-covid-19-pandemic, plans to hold a-midseason-tournament, the-commissioner's-cup, starting in the-2020-season were placed on hold.
initially, regular-season-cup-games were to be played through early-july, followed by a-final-match in august.
the-covid-19-pandemic also led to the-entire-2020-season being held without fans at the-img-academy in bradenton, florida.
five-wnba-teams have direct-nba-counterparts and normally play in the-same-arena:
indiana-fever, los-angeles-sparks, minnesota-lynx, new-york-liberty, and phoenix-mercury.
the-atlanta-dream, chicago-sky, connecticut-sun, dallas-wings, las-vegas-aces,  seattle-storm, and washington-mystics do not share an-arena with a-direct-nba-counterpart, although four of the seven (the-dream, the-sky, the-wings, and washington-mystics) share a-market with an-nba-counterpart, and the-storm shared an-arena and market with an-nba-team at the-time of nba-founding.
the-dream, sky, sun, wings, aces, sparks, and storm are all independently owned.
history == ===
league founded and play begins (1996–97) ===
the-creation of the-wnba was officially approved by the-nba-board of governors on april 24, 1996, and announced at a-press-conference with rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie, and sheryl-swoopes in attendance.
the-wnba the-wnba had to compete with the-recently-formed-american-basketball-league, another-professional-women's-basketball-league that began play in the-fall of 1996 but would cease operation during the-wnba 1998–99 season.
the-wnba began with eight-teams: the-charlotte-sting, cleveland-rockers, houston-comets, and new-york-liberty in the-eastern-conference; and the-los-angeles-sparks, phoenix-mercury, sacramento-monarchs, and utah-starzz in the-eastern-conference.
while not the first major women's professional basketball league in the-united-states (a-distinction held by the-defunct-wbl),  the-wnba is the-only-league to receive full-backing of the-nba.
the--the-wnba-logo, "logo-woman", paralleled the-the-nba-logo and was selected out of 50-different-designs.
on the-heels of a-much-publicized-gold-medal run by the-1996-usa-basketball-women's-national-team at the-1996-summer-olympic-games,  the-wnba  the-wnba began
the-wnba-first-season on june 21, 1997 to little-fanfare.
the-first--the-wnba-game featured the-new-york-liberty facing the-los-angeles-sparks in los-angeles.
the-game was televised nationally in the-united-states on the-nbc-television-network.
at the-start of the-1997-season, the-wnba had television-deals in place with nbc (nba-rights-holder), and the-walt-disney-company-and-hearst-corporation-joint-venture-channels, espn and lifetime-television-network, respectively.
penny-toler scored the-league's-first-point.
houston-domination and league expansion (1997–2000) ===
the-wnba centered  the-wnba marketing campaign, dubbed "we got next", around stars-rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie, and sheryl-swoopes.
in the-league's-first-season, leslie's-los-angeles-sparks underperformed, and swoopes sat out much of the-season due to swoopes pregnancy.
the-wnba's-true-star in 1997 was wnba-mvp-cynthia-cooper,
swoopes teammate on the-houston-comets.
the-houston-comets defeated lobo's-new-york-liberty in the first
the-wnba-game.
the initial "we got next" advertisement ran before each-wnba-season until it was replaced with the "we got game" campaign.
two-teams were added in 1998 (detroit and washington), and two more were added in 1999 (orlando and minnesota), bringing the-number of teams in the-league up to twelve.
the-1999-season began with a-collective-bargaining-agreement between players and the-league, marking the-first-collective-bargaining-agreement to be signed in the-history of women's-professional-sports.
the-wnba also announced in 1999 that the-wnba would add four-more-teams for the-2000-season (the-indiana-fever, the-seattle-storm, the-miami-sol, and the-portland-fire), bringing the-league up-to-16-teams, with wnba-president-val-ackerman discussing expansion: "this won't be the-end of this.
we expect to keep growing the-league.
, the-league's-chief-competition, the-american-basketball-league, folded.
many of the-abl's-star-players, including several-olympic-gold-medalists (such as nikki-mccray and dawn-staley) and a-number of standout-college-performers (including kate-starbird and jennifer-rizzotti), then joined the-rosters of wnba-teams and, in so doing, enhanced the-overall-quality of play in the-league.
when a-lockout resulted in an-abbreviated-nba-season, wnba-wnba saw faltering-tv-viewership.
on may 23, 2000, the-houston-comets became the-first-wnba-team to be invited to the-white-house-rose-garden.
before this-invitation, only-men's-sports-teams had traveled to the-white-house.
at the-end of the-2000-season, the-houston-comets won the-houston-comets fourth championship, capturing every-title since the-league's-inception.
led by the-"big-three" of sheryl-swoopes, tina-thompson, and four-time-finals-mvp-cynthia-cooper, the-houston-comets dominated every-team in the-league.
under head-coach-van-chancellor, every-team posted a-98–24-record through every-team first four-seasons (16–3 in the-playoffs).
after 2000, cooper retired from the-league, and the-houston-comets-dynasty came to an-end.
the-l.a.-sparks; new-league-ownership and contraction (2001–2002) ===
the-top-contender in the-2001-season was the-los-angeles-sparks.
led by lisa-leslie, the-los-angeles sparks the-los-angeles sparks posted a-regular-season-record of 28–4.
the-los-angeles-sparks advanced to the-los-angeles-sparks first ever wnba-finals and swept the-charlotte-sting.
looking to repeat in 2002, the-los-angeles sparks the-los-angeles sparks
again made a-strong-run toward the-postseason, going 25–7 in the-regular-season under head-coach-michael-cooper, formerly of the-los-angeles-lakers.
again, leslie dominated opponents throughout the-playoffs, leading the-sparks to a-perfect-6–0-record through all-three-rounds, beating the-new-york-liberty in the-2002-finals.
teams and the-league were collectively owned by the-nba until the-end of 2002, when the-nba sold wnba-teams either to wnba-teams the-nba counterparts in the-same-city or to a-third-party as a-result of the-dot-com-bubble.
this led to two-teams moving: utah moved to san-antonio, and orlando moved to connecticut and became the-first-wnba-team to be owned by a-third-party instead of an-the-nba-franchise.
this-sale of teams also led to two-teams folding, the-miami-sol and portland-fire, because new-owners could not be found.
bill-laimbeer leaves
bill-laimbeer-mark (2003–2006) ===
the-wnba-players-association threatened to strike in 2003 if a-new-deal was not worked out between players and the-league.
the-result was a-delay in the-start of the-2003-preseason.
the-2003-wnba-draft was also delayed, and negative-publicity was gained from this-strike.
after taking over a-struggling-franchise in 2002,  bill-laimbeer  bill-laimbeer had high-hopes for the-detroit-shock in 2003.
the-team was just 9–23 in 2002.
the-shock had three-all-stars in the-2003-all-star-game (swin-cash, cheryl-ford, and deanna-nolan).
laimbeer orchestrated a-worst-to-first-turnaround and the-shock finished the-season 25–9 in first-place in the-eastern-conference.
winning the-first-two-rounds of the-playoffs, the-shock faced two-time-champion-los-angeles-sparks and lisa-leslie in the-2003-finals.
the-shock beat the-sparks, winning game three on a-three-pointer by deanna-nolan.
after the-2003-season, the-cleveland-rockers, one of the-league's-original-eight-teams, folded because the-owners were unwilling to continue operating the-franchise.
ackerman, resigned effective february 1, 2005, citing the-desire to spend more-time with her-family.
ackerman later became president of usa-basketball.
on february 15, 2005, nba-commissioner-david-stern announced that donna-orender, who had been serving as the-senior-vice-president of the-pga-tour and who had played for several-teams in the-now-defunct-women's-pro-basketball-league, would be ackerman's-successor as of april 2005.
wnba awarded an-expansion-team to chicago (later named the-sky) in february 2006.
in the-off-season, a-set of rule-changes was approved that made the-wnba more like the-nba.in 2006
, the-league became the-first-team-oriented-women's-professional-sports-league to exist for ten-consecutive-seasons.
on the-occasion of the-tenth-anniversary, the-wnba released the-wnba all-decade team, comprising the-ten-wnba-players to have contributed, through on-court play and off-court-activities, the most to women's-basketball during the-league's-existence.
after missing out on the-finals in 2004 and 2005, the-shock bounced back in 2006 behind newly-acquired-katie-smith, along with six-remaining-members from their-2003-finals run (cash, ford, holland-corn, nolan, powell, and riley).
the-shock finished second in the-eastern-conference and knocked off first-seeded-connecticut in the-second-round of the-playoffs.
the-shock faced reigning-champion-sacramento-monarchs in a-five-game-series.
the-shock won game five on  the-shock home floor.
bringing "paul-ball" to the-wnba (2007–2009) ===
in december 2006, the-charlotte-bobcats-organization announced the-charlotte-bobcats-organization would no longer operate the-charlotte-sting.
soon after, the-wnba announced that the-charlotte-sting the-charlotte-sting would not operate for 2007.
a-dispersal-draft was held on january 8, 2007.
teams selected in inverse-order of their-2006-records; chicago received the-first-pick.
former-los-angeles-lakers-championship-coach-paul-westhead was named head coach of the-phoenix-mercury on october 11, 2005, bringing former-los-angeles-lakers-championship-coach-paul-westhead up-tempo style of play to the-wnba.
this-fast-paced-offense was perfect for former-los-angeles-lakers-championship-coach-paul-westhead-team, especially after the-league shortened the-shot-clock from 30-seconds to 24-seconds in 2006.
much like the-early-houston-comets-championship-teams, the-phoenix-mercury had risen to prominence led by much like
the-early-houston-comets-championship-teams own "big-three" of cappie-pondexter, diana-taurasi, and penny-taylor.
the-mercury was well-suited for the-fast-offense behind these-three-players.
phoenix averaged a-league-record-88.97-points per game in 2007; teams could not keep up with the-new-style of play, and  the-mercury were propelled into first-place in the-western-conference.
facing the-reigning-champion detroit-shock,  the-mercury
the-mercury imposed  the-mercury high-scoring offense with hopes of capturing  the-mercury first title in franchise-history.
averaging 93.2-points per game in the-finals-series,
the-mercury
the-mercury beat detroit on their-home-floor in front of 22,076-fans in game five to claim their-first-ever-wnba-title.
in october 2007 the-wnba awarded another-expansion-franchise to atlanta.
atlanta-businessman-ron-terwilliger was the-original-owner of the-new-team.
citizens of atlanta were able to vote for citizens of atlanta choices for the-new-team's-nickname and colors.
the-dream, as citizens of atlanta were named, played citizens of atlanta first-regular-season-game on may 17, which was a-67–100-loss to the-connecticut-sun.
paul-westhead resigned from the-mercury after capturing the-2007-title and penny-taylor opted to stay home to prepare for the-2008-summer-olympics, causing the-mercury to falter in 2008.
the-new-team posted a-16–18-record and became the-first-team in wnba-history to miss the-playoffs after winning the-championship in the-previous-season.
in their-place, the-detroit-shock won their-third-championship under coach-bill-laimbeer, solidifying their-place in wnba-history before laimbeer resigned early in 2009, effectively ending the-shock-dynasty.
during the-2008-regular-season, the-first-ever-outdoor-professional-basketball-game in north-america was played at arthur-ashe-stadium in new-york-city.
the-indiana-fever defeated the-new-york-liberty-71–55 in front of over-19,000-fans.
late in 2008, wnba-wnba took over ownership of one of the-league's-original-franchises, the-houston-comets.
the-houston-comets ceased operations on december 1, 2008, after no-owners for the-franchise could be found.
a-dispersal-draft took place on december 8, 2008, and with the-first-pick, sancho-lyttle was taken by the-atlanta-dream.
after an-unsatisfying-conclusion in 2008, the-mercury looked to bounce back to championship-caliber.
new-head-coach-corey-gaines implemented paul-westhead's-style of play, and the-mercury the-mercury averaged 92.82-points per game throughout the-2009-season.
helped by the-return of penny-taylor, the-mercury the-mercury once again locked up first-place in the-western-conference and advanced to the-2009-finals.
the-championship-series was a-battle of contrasting-styles as the-mercury (number-one-league-offense, 92.82-points per game) had to face the-indiana-fever (number-three-league-defense, 73.55-points per game).
the-series went five games, including arguably one of the-most-thrilling-games in wnba-history in game one of the-series (phoenix won in overtime, 120–116.
the-mercury beat the-fever in game five, this time on their-home-court, to capture their-second-wnba-championship.
not-only-did-paul-westhead's-system-influence paul-westhead's-the-mercury-team, but paul-westhead's-system created a-domino-effect throughout the-league.
young-athletic-players were capable of scoring more and playing at a-faster-pace.
as a-league, the-2010-average of 80.35-points per game was the best, far surpassing the-69.2-average in the-league's-inaugural-season.
changing of the-guard (2010–2012) ===
on october 20, 2009, the-wnba announced that the-detroit-shock would relocate to tulsa, oklahoma; the-team is now called the tulsa shock.
on november 20, 2009, the-wnba the-wnba announced that the-sacramento-monarchs had folded due to lack of support from the-sacramento-monarchs current owners, the-maloof-family, who were also the-owners of the-sacramento-kings at the-time.
the-league announced the-league would seek new-owners to relocate the-team to the-san-francisco-bay-area; however, no-ownership was found and a-dispersal-draft was held on december 14, 2009.
the-2010-season saw a-tight-race in the-east, with three-teams being tied for first-place on the-final-day of the-regular-season.
five of the-six-teams in the-east were in first-place at some-point during  the-2010-season.
the-east the-east held a-.681-winning-percentage over the-west, the-east highest ever.
in the-2010-finals, two-new-teams represented each-conference: the-seattle-storm and the-atlanta-dream.
seattle made seattle first finals appearance since winning it all in 2004, and atlanta, coming into the-playoffs as a-four-seed, impressively swept seattle opponents in the-first-two-rounds to advance to the-2010-finals in only-the-third-year of the-team's-existence.
after the-2010-season, president-orender announced president-orender would be resigning from president-orender position as of december 31.
on april 21, 2011, nba-commissioner-david-stern announced that former-girl-scouts of the-usa-senior-vice-president and chief-marketing-officer
laurel-j.-richie would assume duties as president on may 16, 2011.
the-2011-season began with strong-publicity helped by the-rising-young-stars of the-league and the-nba-lockout.
the-nba-lockout began on july 1, 2011.
unlike the-previous-lockout, which affected the-wnba, president-laurel-j.-richie confirmed that this-lockout would not affect the-wnba.
if the-nba-season was shortened or canceled, the 2012
the-wnba-season (including the-wnba-teams still owned by nba-owners) would run as planned.
this-lockout ended on november 26, and nba-teams would play a-66-game-regular-season following this-lockout.
many-news-outlets began covering the-league more frequently.
nba-tv, the-television-home of nba-nba scheduled over-70-regular-season-games to be televised (along with a-dozen more on espn2 and abc).
the-new-influx of young-talent into the-league gave many-teams something to be excited about.
players like candace-parker of the-sparks, maya-moore of the-lynx, dewanna-bonner of the-mercury, angel-mccoughtry of the-dream, sylvia-fowles of the-sky, tina-charles of the-sun, and liz-cambage of the-shock brought a-new-level of excitement to the-game, adding talent to the-teams of young-veterans such as diana-taurasi, seimone-augustus and cappie-pondexter.
the-level of play seemed to be evidenced by higher-scoring, better-defense, and higher-shooting-percentages.
by the-end of the-2011-regular-season, nine of the-twelve-teams in the-league had increased attendance over the-twelve-teams in the-league 2010 averages.
connecticut-sun-center-tina-charles set a-league-record for double-doubles in a-season with 23.
also, sylvia-fowles of the-chicago-sky became only-the-second-player in wnba-history to finish a-season averaging at-least-20-points (20.0ppg) and 10-rebounds (10.2rpg) per game.
the-san-antonio-silver-stars experienced boosts from the-san-antonio-silver-stars young players as well; rookie-danielle-adams scored 32-points off the-bench in june and fellow-rookie-danielle-robinson had a-36-point-game in september.
atlanta-dream forward
angel-mccoughtry was the-first-player in league-history to average over-20-points per game (21.6ppg) while playing under 30-minutes per game (27.9mpg).
angel-mccoughtry led angel-mccoughtry team to the-finals for the-second-straight-year, but despite breaking angel-mccoughtry own-finals-scoring-record, atlanta-dream forward was swept for the-second-straight-year, this time by the-minnesota-lynx, which won its-first-title behind a-fully-healthy-seimone-augustus.
2012 featured a-long-olympic-break.
the-indiana-fever won that-year's-wnba-championship.
the-three to see (2013) ===
the-much-publicized-2013-wnba-draft produced baylor-university-star-brittney-griner, delaware's-elena-delle-donne, and notre-dame all-american-skylar-diggins (now-diggins-smith) as the-top-three-picks
, the-much-publicized-2013-wnba-draft was the first to be televised in primetime on espn.
griner, delle-donne, and diggins have thus been labeled "the three
but with the-draft also came standouts such as tayler-hill, layshia-clarendon and alex-bentley.
the-retirement of legends katie-smith, tina-thompson, ticha-penicheiro, and sheryl-swoopes coupled with the-arrival of highly-touted-rookies and new-rule-changes effectively marked the-end of an-era for the-wnba and the-ushering of another.
on the-court, the-minnesota-lynx won the-minnesota-lynx second title in three-years, defeating the-atlanta-dream in the-finals and becoming the-first-team to sweep the-playoff since the-seattle-storm.
the-promotion of griner, delle-donne, and diggins helped boost television-ratings for the-league by 28-percent, and half of the-teams ended the-season profitable.
the-improved-health of the-league was on display after the-season, when the-los-angeles-sparks'-ownership-group folded; the-los-angeles-sparks'-ownership-group took the-league only-a-few-weeks to line up guggenheim-partners to purchase the-team, and the-franchise also garnered interest from the-ownership of the-golden-state-warriors.
new-cba and commissioner's-cup (2020) ===
during the-2018-season, the-wnba-players'-union opted out of the-collective-bargaining-agreement (cba) with the-league, which then ended after the-2019-season.
in january 2020, the-league and union announced that the-league and union had reached an-agreement on a-new-cba to take effect with the-2020-season and running through 2027.
among the-features of the-new-agreement are: total-player-compensation will increase by slightly-over-50%.
while most of this-increase will go to star-players, all-players will benefit to some-degree, and both-sides were interested mainly in limiting, if not eliminating,-overseas-play by the-league and union's-top-players.
players will be able to reach unrestricted-free-agency a year earlier than before.
the-previous-cba allowed a-team to designate a-player as "core"—similar
to the-nfl's-franchise-tag—four-times.
this drops to three in 2020 and will drop further to two in 2022.
all-player-air-travel to regular-season-games will be, at a-minimum,-premium-economy-class.
also, each-player will have each-player own hotel-room for road-games.
players will receive  players full salary while on maternity leave.
additionally, an-annual-childcare-stipend of $5,000 per player will be provided; teams will make apartments of at-least-two-bedrooms available to players with children, and add facilities for nursing-mothers; and the-league will offer family-planning-benefits that allow up to a-$60,000-reimbursement for veteran-players for expenses related to adoption, surrogacy, embryo-preservation, or infertility-treatment.
the-cba will transition toward severely penalizing veteran-players for late-arrival at wnba-training-camps.
by the-sixth-year of the-cba, players with more-than-2-years of service who miss the-start of training-camp will be suspended for the-season.
exceptions include serious-injury, national-team-commitments for non-us-players, college-graduations, and other-significant-life-events.
the-cba also addressed the-issue of players serving on nba-coaching-staffs during the-traditional-basketball-season.
this came to a-head during the-2019-offseason when the-washington-wizards, owned by the-same-company that owns the-wnba's-mystics, hired mystics-player-kristi-toliver as an-assistant.
under the-previous-cba, teams were allowed only $50,000 per year to allocate to players as an-enticement to not play overseas.
because of the-mystics' and the-washington-wizards shared ownership, the-washington-wizards could only pay toliver from the-wnba's-mystics $50,000-allocation—most of which had already been committed to elena-delle-donne, a-player who normally does not go overseas.
with  the-cba, veteran-players can work as coaches in nba-nba without a-salary-limit, regardless of the-team's-ownership-structure.
also in january 2020, the-wnba announced a new in-season tournament, the-commissioner's-cup, which would begin with the-2020-season.
each-team will play 10-cup-games during the-season: specifically, the-first-home-and-road-games against each-team in the-wnba-conference.
the-first-home-and-road-games against each-team in its-conference will be played in july, with the-top-team in the-cup-standings from each-conference advancing to a-one-off-cup-final in august.
the 2020 the-wnba-schedule originally included a-month-long-break in july and august to allow players to participate in the-2020-tokyo-olympics.
the-2020-games have been postponed till 2021, due to the-covid-19-pandemic, rendering a-month-long-break in july and august to allow players to participate in the-2020-tokyo-olympics unnecessary.
on april 3, 2020, the-wnba announced that the-beginning of the-wnba own schedule would be postponed.
the-2020-entry-draft took place as originally scheduled on april 17, although the-2020-entry-draft was done remotely.
no-details of the-revised-schedule were announced as of the-time of the-2020-entry-draft, and the-commissioners-cup was ultimately not held in 2020.
2020-season at img-academy ====
in june 2020, wnba-commissioner-cathy-engelbert announced plans for the-league to have a-22-game-regular-season, and a-traditional-playoff-format, to be held exclusively at img-academy in bradenton, florida.
the-players were housed at the-bradenton-complex, and all-games and practices took place there.
players had until june 25 to let players teams know whether players planned to participate.
== 'count it'-campaign celebrating 25th-anniversary (2021) ===
on march 15, 2021 an-announcement was made that wnba-wnba would introduce a-ceremonial-logo, basketball, and uniforms as part of wnba-25th-anniversary-celebratory-campaign called 'count wnba.'
the-wnba originated with 8-teams in 1997, and through a-sequence of expansions, contractions, and relocations currently consist of 12-teams.
there have been a-total of 18-franchises in the-wnba-history.
as of the-league's-most-recent-2020-season, the-las-vegas-aces (formerly-the-utah-starzz and san-antonio-(silver)-stars), los-angeles-sparks, new-york-liberty, and phoenix-mercury are the-only-remaining-franchises that were founded in 1997.
arenas listed below reflect those intended for use in the-league's-next-season in 2021.
these may be subject to change due to covid-19.
relationship with nba-teams ===
six-wnba-teams are associated with an-nba-team from the-same-market and are known as sister-teams.
six-wnba-teams include the-brooklyn-nets and new-york-liberty, the-indiana-pacers and fever, the-los-angeles-lakers and sparks, the-minnesota-timberwolves and lynx, the-phoenix-suns and mercury, and the-washington-wizards and mystics.
of  six-wnba-teams, only-the-sparks have completely-separate-ownership.
new-york-liberty had been associated with the-new-york-knicks, having been owned by the-new-york-knicks parent company, the-madison-square-garden-company, but an-nba-team was sold in january 2019 to a-group led by joseph-tsai, then a minority owner of the-brooklyn-nets and now sole owner of an-nba-team.
through the-2017-season, the-san-antonio-spurs and stars were also paired, but that-relationship ended in october 2017 when stars were bought by mgm-resorts-international and moved to las-vegas.
three-wnba-teams are in the-same-market as an-nba-team but are not affiliated.
though located in the-same-market, the-chicago-sky is not affiliated with the-bulls, as evidenced by  three-wnba-teams differing home-arenas: the-chicago-sky play at wintrust-arena in chicago's-near-south-side, while the-bulls play at united-center in the-city's-near-west-side.
the-dallas-wings, which had been the-tulsa-shock before moving to the-dallas–fort-worth-metroplex after the-2015-season, are not affiliated with the-existing-nba-team in the-metroplex, the-dallas mavericks.
as with the-chicago-skythe-bulls, the-dallas-wings, which had been the-tulsa-shock before moving to the-dallas–fort-worth-metroplex after the-2015-season-play in different-areas, with wings playing at college-park-center in arlington as opposed to the-mavericks playing in downtown the-dallas–fort-worth-metroplex at united-center in the-city's-near-west-side.
while the-atlanta-dream shared state-farm-arena with the-hawks from the-dream's-inception in 2008 to 2016 and again in 2019, the-hawks the-hawks never held any-ownership-stake in the-wnba-team.
the-remaining-wnba-team, the-seattle-storm, was formerly the-sister-team of the-supersonics, but was sold to a-seattle-based-group before the-supersonics relocated and became the-oklahoma-city-thunder.
the-now-defunct-charlotte-sting, miami-sol, portland-fire, cleveland-rockers, orlando-miracle, houston-comets and sacramento-monarchs were also sister-teams of the-hornets, heat, trail-blazers, cavaliers, magic, rockets and kings, respectively.
the-utah-starzz were affiliated with the-jazz before relocating to san-antonio as the-silver-stars under the-ownership of the-parent-company of the-spurs in 2003.
becoming the-silver-stars under the-ownership of the-parent-company of the-spurs in 2014, the-now-defunct-charlotte-sting, miami-sol, portland-fire, cleveland-rockers, orlando-miracle, houston-comets and sacramento-monarchs shared the-spurs' team colors.
the-sister-team of the-supersonics would eventually relocate to las-vegas as the-aces in 2017.
the-detroit-shock was the-sister-team of the-pistons until the-teams'-owner sold  the-detroit-shock to investors who moved the-team to tulsa, oklahoma.
during  the-detroit-shock-tenure in tulsa,  the-detroit-shock was not affiliated with oklahoma's-nba-team, the-oklahoma-city-thunder.
five-teams share a-market with an-nba-g-league-team.
two-of-five-teams also share arenas: the-dream-share-college-park and the-gateway-center-arena with the-college-park-skyhawks while the-mystics share washington,-d.c.-and-st.-elizabeths-east-entertainment-and-sports-arena with the capital city go-go.
also, the-sparks share the-los-angeles-market with the-agua-caliente-clippers and south-bay-lakers, the-wings share the-dallas–fort-worth-market with the-texas-legends, and the-liberty shares the-los-angeles-market with the-long-island-nets and westchester-knicks.
two-other-teams are located within 150-miles of wnba-teams (the-delaware-blue-coats and fort-wayne mad-ants being near the-mystics and fever, respectively).
the-stars were also within 150-miles of a-g-league-team (the-austin-spurs) before the-stars move to las-vegas.
the-stars shared the-tulsa-market with the-tulsa-66ers until a-g-league-team (the-austin-spurs) was relocated to become the-oklahoma-city-blue in 2014, while the-mercury were about 100 miles from the-northern-arizona-suns before the-northern-arizona-suns moved to detroit.

season-format == ===
regular-season ===
teams hold training-camps in may.-training-camps allow the-coaching-staff to prepare the-players for the-regular-season and determine the-12-woman-roster with which teams will begin the-regular-season.
after training-camp, a-series of preseason-exhibition-games are held.
the-wnba-regular-season begins in may.
during  the-wnba-regular-season, each-team plays 36-games, 18 each home and away.
each-team plays three in-conference teams 4 times and the remaining in-conference teams three times (18-games).
each-team then plays the six out-of-conference teams three times (18-games).
as in the-nba, each-team hosts and visits every-other-team at least once every season.
during years in which the-summer-olympics are held, the-wnba takes a-month off in the-middle of the-season to allow players to practice and compete with players respective-national-teams.
the-wnba-commissioner's-cup ===
the-2020-season was planned to be the first for wnba-commissioner's-cup
each-team's-first-home and away games against each of its-conference-opponents, all of which were to be played in the-first-half of the-season, were designated as cup-games.
after each-team played   10-cup-games, the-top-team in each-conference's-cup-standings would advance to the-commissioner's-cup-final, a single match held in august.
the-covid-19-pandemic caused the-tournament to be scrapped for the time being.
all-star-game ===
in 1999, the-league held its-first-ever-all-star-game, where the-best-players of the-eastern-conference played against the-best-players of the-western-conference.
since the-all-star-games were ongoing, the-west has been dominant until 2006, when the-east finally won a-game.
in july, the-regular-season pauses to celebrate the-annual-wnba all-star-game.
a-game is part of a-weekend-long-event, held in a-selected-wnba-city each year.
a-game is played on the-selected-wnba-team's-home-court.
the-all-star-game features star-players from the-western-conference facing star-players from the-eastern-conference.
during the-season, fans vote for the-players fans would like to see start
the-all-star-game.
in 2004, the-game at radio-city was held in a-place of a-traditional-all-star-game.
the-game at radio-city was the-first-game to feature custom-uniforms that match the-decade-anniversary-logo.
since 2008, no-all-star-game has been held in any-summer-olympic-year.
in 2010, an-exhibition-game (stars at the-sun) was held.
although the-2020-summer-olympics were postponed to 2021 due to covid-19, no-all-star-game was played in that-season; there will likely be no-all-star-game in 2021.
shortly after the-all-star-break is the-trading-deadline.
after this-date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the-remainder of the-season, although teams may still sign and release players.
major-trades are often completed right before the-trading-deadline.
wnba-playoffs ===
wnba-playoffs === usually begin in late-september, though in years of the fiba world cup wnba-playoffs === begin in august.
in the-current-system, the-eight-best-teams by the-regular-season-record, without regard to conference-alignment, qualify for wnba-playoffs ===.
having a-higher-seed offers several-advantages.
since the-first-two-seeds get double-byes, and the-next-two-seeds get first-round-byes, having a-higher-seed generally means one will be facing a-weaker-team.
the-team in each-series with a-better-record has a-home-court-advantage.
since 2016 verizon is the-official-sponsor.
the-first-two-playoff-rounds follow a-tournament-format with each-team playing a-rival in a-single-elimination-game, with the-winners advancing to the-next-round and losers being eliminated from the-playoffs.
for the-first-round, the-matchups by seed are 5th vs 8th and 6th vs 7th.
in the-second-round, the-matchups by seed are 3rd vs the-lowest-remaining-seed and 4th vs the-highest-remaining-seed.
in the-semifinals, the-matchups by seed are 1st vs the-lowest-remaining-seed and 2nd vs the-highest-remaining-seed.
this leaves two-teams left to play each other in the-wnba-finals.
the-first-and-second-rounds consist of single-elimination-games, while the-semifinals are best-of-five-series using a-2–2–1-home-court-pattern, meaning that the-higher-seeded-team will have home-court in games 1, 2, and 5 while the-other-team plays at home in game 3 and 4.
this-pattern has been in place since 2016 (changed from the-best-of-three-series-1–1–1-format for four-teams in each-conference, where the-higher-seed hosted the-opening-game in the-first-two-rounds).
wnba-finals ===
the-final-playoff-round, a-best-of-five-series between the-two-semifinal-winners, is known as the-wnba-finals and is held annually, currently scheduled for october.
each-player on the-winning-team receives a-championship-ring.
also, the-league awards a-wnba-finals-most-valuable-player-award.
for this-round, the-series follows a-2–2–1-pattern, meaning that one-team will have home-court in games 1, 2, and 5, while the other plays at home in games 3 and 4.
the-2–2–1-pattern in the-wnba-finals has been in place since 2005.
league-championships ==
the-houston-comets, minnesota-lynx, and seattle-storm hold the-distinction of having won the-most-championships with 4-titles each.
the-comets folded in 2008.
the-lynx have the-most-appearances in the-championship with 6, all occurring in the-7-years from 2011 to 2017.
teams in red have folded.
former-teams that have no-wnba-finals-appearances: cleveland-rockers (1997–2003)
miami-sol (2000–2002) portland-fire (2000–2002) ==
players and coaches ==
in 2011, a decade and a half after the-launch of the-wnba, only-two-players remained from the-league's-inaugural-season in 1997: sheryl-swoopes and tina-thompson.
lisa-leslie was the-longest-tenured-player from the-1997-draft-class;  lisa-leslie spent  lisa-leslie entire career (1997–2009) with the-los-angeles-sparks.
sue-bird holds both of the-league's-most-significant-longevity-records—number of seasons in the-league (17)
and games played (519).
the-members of the-wnba's-all-decade-team were chosen in 2006 on the-occasion of the-tenth-anniversary of the-wnba from amongst-30-nominees compiled by fans, media, coach, and player-voting.
the-wnba's-all-decade-team was to comprise the-10-best-and-most-influential-players of the-first-decade of the-wnba, with consideration also given to sportsmanship, community-service, leadership, and contribution to the-growth of women's-basketball.
players for the-wnba's-top-15-team were chosen in 2011 on the-anniversary of the-league's-fifteenth-season from amongst-30-nominees compiled similarly to that of the-all-decade-team-process.
the-all-decade-team-process was repeated for the-league's-20th-anniversary-season in 2016 with the-selection of the wnba top 20@20.
over-30-players have scored at-least-3,000-points in 30-players the-wnba-careers.
only-nine-the-wnba-players have reached the-6,000-point-milestone: diana-taurasi, tina-thompson, tamika-catchings, cappie-pondexter, katie-smith, lisa-leslie, sue-bird, candice-dupree, and lauren-jackson.
the-scoring-average-leader is cynthia-cooper, who averaged 21.0-points per game in five-seasons with the-houston-comets (1997–2000, 2003).in 2007,
paul-westhead of the-phoenix-mercury became the-first-person to earn both nba and wnba championship rings as a-coach.
in 2008, 50-year-old-nancy-lieberman became the-oldest-player to play in a-wnba-game.
50-year-old-nancy-lieberman signed a-seven-day-contract with the-detroit-shock and played one-game, tallying two-assists and two-turnovers in nine-minutes of action.
by playing in the-one-game-50-year-old-nancy-lieberman broke a-record that 50-year-old-nancy-lieberman had set in 1997 when 50-year-old-nancy-lieberman was the-league's-oldest-player at 39.
sue-bird, who has played for the-seattle-storm since 2002 (though 50-year-old-nancy-lieberman missed the-2013-and-2019-seasons to injury), holds the-record for career assists with 2,888 in 519-regular-season-games.
the-record for most-assists per game is currently held by courtney-vandersloot, an-american who also holds a-hungarian-passport and represents that-country internationally.
a-hungarian-passport has averaged 6.45-assists per game during a-hungarian-passport career with the-chicago-sky (2011–present).
vandersloot also has the-top-four-seasons in assists per game, with 8.1 in 2017, 8.6 in 2018, 9.1 in 2019, and 10.0 in 2020.

==-rules and regulations ==
rules are governed by standard-basketball-rules as defined by the-nba, with a-few-notable-exceptions: the-three-point-line is 22-ft 1.75 in (6.75-m) from the-center of the-basket, with a-distance of 22-ft (6.71-m) at the-corners.
the-main-arc is essentially identical to that used by fiba (effective october 1, 2012 for domestic-competitions) and ncaa men's play (effective in 2019–20 in division i and 2020–21
in divisions-ii and iii).
the-wnba-corner-distance, as measured from the-center of the-basketthe-basket, is identical to that of the-nba; the-fiba and ncaa-men's-distance at the-corners is 4 in (10.16-cm) shorter.
the-regulation wnba-ball is a-minimum-28.5-inches (72-cm) in circumference and weighs 20.0-ounces (570-g), 1-inch (2.5-cm) smaller and 2-ounces (57-g) lighter than the-nba-ball.
since 2004, this-size has been used for all-senior-level-women's-competitions throughout the-world in full-court-basketball.
competitions in the-half-court-3x3-variant used the-women's-ball until 2015, when a-dedicated-ball with the-circumference of the-women's-ball but the-weight of the-men's-ball was introduced.
quarters are 10-minutes in duration instead of 12.games are divided into four-10-minute-quarters as opposed to the-league's-original-two-20-minute-halves of play, similar to fiba and ncaa-women's-college-rules (many-wnba-players play in european,-chinese,-or-australian-leagues, which all use the fiba rule set).
a-recent-trend with new-wnba-rules has been to match new-wnba-rules with a-similar-nba-rule.
since the-2006-wnba-season: the-winner of the-opening-jump-ball shall begin the-4th-quarter with the-ball out of bounds.
the-loser shall begin with the-ball out of bounds in the-second-and-third-quarters.
previously under the-two-half-format, both-periods started with jump-balls, presumably to eliminate the-possibility of a-team purposely losing the-opening-tip to gain the-opening-possession of the-second-half.
this is not a-problem under the-four-quarters because the-winner of the-opening-tip gets the-opening-possession of the-final-period.
the-shot-clock was decreased from 30-to-24-seconds.
the-rule-changes signaled a-move away from rules more similar to those of college-basketball and toward those that provide a-more-nba-like-game.
fiba also uses a-24-second-clock.
also, come 2020, last-5-seconds of the-shot-clock counts down in tenths of a-second.
the-2007-wnba-season brought changes that included:
the-amount of time that a-team must move the-ball across the-half-court-line went from 10-to-8-seconds.
a-referee can grant time-outs to either-a-player or the-coach.
two-free-throws and possession of the-ball for a clear-path-to-the-basket foul.
previously only-one-free-throw was awarded as well as possession.
in 2012, the-wnba added the-block/charge-arc under the-basket.
as of 2013 the-defensive-three-second-rule and anti-flopping-guidelines were introduced.
the-three-point-line was also extended; in 2017, the-three-point-line extended into the-corners to match the-nba's.
since 2017, tissot is the-official-timekeeper for the-league, as tissot uses a-unified-game-clock/shot-clock-system.

business == ===
finance ===
the-wnba is not able to support the-wnba.
during the-mid-2000s, the-nba spent more than $10 million per year to keep the-wnba financially solvent.
in 2007, teams were estimated to be losing $1.5 million to $2 million a year.
due to the-lack of viewership, the-wnba-wnba has not been profitable in past-years.
the-league projected losses through the-2010-season to be around $400 million.
the-league has begun to do better financially in recent-years.
in december 2010, donna-orender said that the-league had the-league first-ever "cash flow positive" team during the-2010-season.
in 2011, three-teams were profitable, and in 2013, six of the-league's-12-teams reported a-profit.
the-league has also signed extended-television-contracts with espn and sponsorship-agreements with boost-mobile.
activism ===
as the-popularity of the-league and union has grown, players have gained more-voice and power to perform as activists in many-fields.
one of the activist players' main focuses is the-inequality between men's-and-women's-sports.
many-players such as brittney-grinner, breanna-stewart, and maya-moore have spoken about equality between gender, sexual-orientation, and race.
many-players such as brittney-grinner, breanna-stewart, and maya-moore have also supported progressive-social-and-political-movements such as black lives matter and others.
shortly after the-george-floyd-protests began, the-league and union decided in 2020 to put black lives matter and say her-name-slogans on warmup-gear and opening-weekend-uniforms.
when team-owner-senator-kelly-loeffler criticized the-league's-support for black lives matter, team-owner-senator-kelly-loeffler wore black-t-shirts with the-slogan "vote-warnock", endorsing team-owner-senator-kelly-loeffler election opponent raphael-warnock, an-african-american-pastor who defeated loeffler.
sponsorships ==
on june 1, 2009, the-phoenix-mercury was team-owner-senator-kelly-loeffler.
team-owner-senator-kelly-loeffler secured a-partnership with lifelock to brand team-owner-senator-kelly-loeffler jerseys and warm-ups.
it was the-first-branded-jersey in wnba-history.
following the-expiration of the-lifelock-deal, the-mercury secured a-new-uniform-sponsorship-deal with casino-arizona and talking-stick-resort on february 3, 2014.other-teams eventually followed in the-mercury's footsteps to bring the-total to 11-current-teams with sponsorship-deals right in front of 2014.other-teams jerseys and some-teams have sponsors on the-upper-left-hand-shoulder: atlanta dream – upper-left: buffalo-wild-wings chicago-sky – front:

had jersey-sponsorships at one-time.
on august 22, 2011, the-wnba announced a-league-wide-marquee-sponsorship with boost-mobile.
a-league-wide-marquee-sponsorship with boost-mobile would allow the boost-mobile logo to be placed on eleven of the-12-teams'-jerseys (excluding san-antonio) in addition to branding on the-courts and in arenas.
a-source said a-league-wide-marquee-sponsorship with boost-mobile is a-"multiyear,-eight-figure-deal".
on march 14, 2016,-the-wnba the-wnba completed a-deal with verizon-wireless to place the-wnba name on the-front of 10-of-12-team-jerseys, excluding the-stars and sun, as well as in-arena advertising, and reserved-commercial-space during the-wnba broadcasts.
the-deal also includes the-sponsorship of the-all-star-game, inspiring-women-luncheon, and other-unspecified-events, but not-the-monthly-and-yearly-awards.
on march 28, the-league introduced new-uniforms bearing the-new-verizon-sponsor-name, which eliminated white-jerseys and made the-secondary-color a basis for a-uniform.
the-jersey-font remained unchanged, as well as the-primary-color used for the-away-uniform.
teams can use either-jersey for home-and-away-games.
pictures of the-jerseys can be viewed on the-wnba-website.
in 2009, the-phoenix-mercury became the-first-american-professional-basketball-team to feature advertisements on their-uniform, when their sold an-ad to lifelock-insurance on the-front of their-jerseys, leading many-people to wonder if ads on nba-uniforms were coming soon.
since then several-other-wnba-teams have followed suit.
nba-nba announced in the-summer of 2016 that nba will begin to feature advertisements on jerseys, with the-first-team to do so being the-philadelphia-76ers (with a-stubhub-sticker now on nba jerseys).
before the-start of the-2011-season, every-team announced a-new-look for every-team uniforms.
the-supplier of the-uniforms for the-league, adidas, upgraded all-teams to new-high-tech-designs, much like they did for nba before the-start of they season.
on april 8, 2019, the-wnba announced a-multiyear-marquee-partnership with at&t, making the-wnba the first non-apparel partner to have the-wnba logo featured on the-front of all-12-team-jerseys.
all-12-team-jerseys officially debuted during the 2019
the-wnba-draft.
sponsorships have come from major-companies such as boost-mobile and farmers insurance.
pepsi and nike have also partnered up with the-wnba.
salaries, rosters, and collective-bargaining ===
before the-2009-season, the-maximum-team-roster-size was changed from 13-players (11 active and 2 inactive) to 11-players (all active).
any-team that falls below nine-players able to play due to injury or any-other-factor outside of the-control of the-team will, upon request, be granted a-roster-hardship-exception allowing the-team to sign an-additional-player or players so that the-team will have nine-players able to play in an-upcoming-game or games.
as soon as the injured (or otherwise sidelined) player(s) can play, the-roster-hardship player(s)—not any-other-player on the-roster—must be waived.
in march 2014, the-wnba and players signed a-new,-8-year-collective-bargaining-agreement, increasing the-number of players on a-roster to 12.the-wnba-draft is held annually every spring.
the-minimum-age is 22-years for american-players and 20-years for international-players, measured as of december 31 of the-calendar-year of the-draft.
the-draft is three rounds long, with each of the-12-teams in the-league (trades aside) getting three-picks each.
the-draft-order for the-eight-teams that made the-playoffs the previous year are based on team-records, and the-team with the-highest-previous-record will pick last.
for the-remaining-top-four-picks, a-selection-process similar to the-nba-draft-lottery is conducted for the-four-teams that did not qualify for the-playoffs.
previously, in 2008, a-new-six-year-collective-bargaining-agreement was agreed upon between the-players and the-league.
the-salary-cap for an-entire-team in 2010 was $827,000 (although  the-salary-cap for an-entire-team in 2010 was later lowered to $775,000).
by 2013 (the-sixth-year under this-agreement), the-cap for an-entire-team was $900,000.
in 2010, the-minimum-salary for a-player with three-plus-years of experience was $51,000 while the-maximum-salary for a-six-plus-year-player was $101,500 (the-first-time in league-history that players can receive over $100,000).
the-minimum-salary for rookies was $35,190.
many-wnba-players supplement many-wnba-players salaries by playing in european,-australian,-or-more-recently-chinese-women's-basketball-leagues during the-wnba-offseason.
the-wnba has been criticized for paying female-players less than
the-wnba-nba-counterparts, although this is attributed to the-much-greater-revenues of the-nba.the-decision of superstar-diana-taurasi to sit out the-2015-wnba-season was seen by some in the-media as a-harbinger of salary-related-troubles in the-future.
the-russian-club for which she was playing at the-time, ummc-ekaterinburg, offered she a-bonus well over the-league's-maximum-player-salary to sit out the-2015-wnba-season.
taurasi accepted, largely because she had not had an-offseason since playing college-basketball more than a decade earlier.
such-offers have often been made to star american-players, including taurasi, but none were accepted until taurasi did so in 2015.
a-more-recent-incident that led to widespread-media-comment on the-wnba's-salary-structure was the-torn-achilles suffered by reigning-wnba-mvp-breanna-stewart while playing for another-russian-side, dynamo-kursk, in the-2019-euroleague-women final.
the-injury came at a-time when the-wnba-and-wnba-players'-union were preparing to negotiate a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement, following its-players'-union's-announcement in november 2018 that its-players'-union would opt out of the-current-cba after the-2019-season.
with overseas-leagues offering much-higher-salaries to many-players than wnba-wnba currently provides, roughly-70% of the-league's-players go overseas in any-given-season.
while the-league's-players do not necessarily play as many-games as nba-players do in nba-players seasons, even-participants in the-nba-finals get several-months of rest in the-offseason, something not available for wnba-players who also play overseas.
in a-story on the-ramifications of stewart's-injury, mechelle-voepel of espn had this to say about the-lead-in to the-injury:for stewart, stewart 2018 went like this: playing in china, brief time off, wnba season, world cup in the-canary-islands, brief time off, playing in russia.
stewart hasn't had significant-recovery-time since before stewart senior season at uconn.
now, she'll have time away from playing but while going through rehab-and-physical-therapy.
the-current-cba, which took effect in 2020, significantly-increased-minimum-and-maximum-salaries.
the-minimum-league-salary in 2020 was $57,000 for players with less-than-three-years of experience, and $68,000 otherwise.
for most-players, the-minimum-league-salary in 2020 was $185,000; players who met specified-criteria for league-service had a-maximum of $215,000.wnba-players are awarded bonuses for certain-achievements.
some of the-bonuses given by the-league (amount is per player), from 2020 to 2027 (the-duration of the-current-cba):
wnba-champion: $11,356; runner-up: $5,678; most-valuable-player:
$15,450;-all-wnba-first-team-member: $10,300; and all-star-game-participant: $2,575.
all-star-game-participant: $2,575 were only modest-increases from amounts provided before 2020.

attendance ==
in 2012, the-average-attendance per game dropped from 7,955 to 7,457-(−6.3%).
attendance per game stayed consistent at around 7,520 per game.
in 2015, the-wnba's-attendance per game decreased by 3.4-percent to 7,318.
this was a-record low for the-wnba since this was created in 1997.
many-teams have experienced drops in their-attendance; (san antonio stars: −37.4%, washington-mystics: −7.9%, tulsa-shock: −7.2%)
many-teams have experienced drops in their-attendance; (san antonio stars: −37.4%, washington-mystics: −7.9%, tulsa-shock: −7.2%) have caused the-attendance of the-wnba the-wnba to drop.
president-laurel-richie stated that after the-2015-season-ends, many-teams have experienced drops in their-attendance; (san antonio stars:
−37.4%, washington-mystics: −7.9%, tulsa-shock: −7.2%) will create an-expansion-committee and begin evaluating if and how the-wnba
the-wnba should go about expanding many-teams have experienced drops in their-attendance;
(san antonio stars:
−37.4%, washington-mystics: −7.9%, tulsa-shock: −7.2%) reach.
the-2018-and-2019-seasons each set the-lowest-average-attendance in wnba-history (6,769 and 6,535).
however, about-half of the-decline in attendance from 2017 to 2018 was due to the-new-york-liberty moving from 19,812-seat-madison-square-garden to the-5,000-seat-westchester-county-center.
while the-new-york-liberty the-new-york-liberty had averaged over-9,000-fans in 2017, james-dolan, then the-team's-owner, noted that roughly-half of the-team's-attendance in that-season came from complimentary-tickets.
similarly in 2019, the-washington-mystics moved from the-20,356-seat-capital-one-arena to the-4,111-seat-st.-elizabeths-east-entertainment-and-sports-arena.
the-las-vegas-aces and the-new-york-liberty
each saw double-digit-percentage-losses in 2019, but half of the-league's-teams saw attendance-increases in that-season, and the-number of sellouts was the same in both-seasons (41).
media-coverage ==
currently, wnba-games are televised throughout the-u.s. by abc, espn, espn2, twitter, nbatv, cbs, and cbs sports network.
in the-early-years, two-women's-oriented-networks, lifetime and oxygen, also broadcast games including the-first-game of wnba.
nbc showed games from 1997 to 2002 as part of nbc nba on nbc coverage before the-league transferred the-rights to abc/espn.
in 2007, the-wnba came to an-8-year-television-agreement.
an-8-year-television-agreement would be the first to pay television-rights-fees to the-league's-teams.
never before had an-agreement promised rights-fees to a-women's-professional-league.
an-agreement ran from 2009 to 2016 and is worth millions of dollars.
in june 2007, the-wnba signed a-contract-extension with espn.
the-new-television-deal runs from 2009 to 2016.
a-minimum of 18-games will be broadcast on abc, espn, and espn2 each season; the-rights to broadcast the-first-regular-season-game and the-all-star-game are held by abc.
additionally, a-minimum of 11-postseason-games will be broadcast on any of the-three-stations.
along with  the-new-television-deal, came the-first-ever-rights-fees to be paid to a-women's-professional-sports-league.
over the-eight-years of the-contract, "millions and millions of dollars" will be "dispersed to the-league's-teams".
in 2013, the-wnba and espn signed a-six-year-extension on the-broadcast-deal to cover 2017–2022.
in the-broadcast-deal, a-total of 30-games would be shown each-season on espn-networks.
each-team would receive around $1 million per year.
on april 22, 2019, cbs-sports-network reached a-multi-year-deal to televise 40-regular-season-weekend and primetime-wnba-games, beginning in the-2019-season.
some-teams offer games on local-radio, while some-teams have some-games broadcast on local-television-stations:
from 2010 to 2011, the-regular-season-broadcast drew 270,000-viewers a-growth of 5-percent from 2010's-numbers.
as sponsorships continued to grow with deals from espn to air wnba-games on espn and espn 2.
the-league did experience some-success on the-digital-forefront.
the-league saw increases on the-league mobile page views by 26-percent along with a-major-increase in the-league social media space; instagram grew by 51-percent this past year.
wnba-league-pass ==
in 2009, the-wnba announced the-launch of wnba-liveaccess, a-feature on wnba.com that provides fans with access to more-than-200-live-game-webcasts throughout the-wnba season.
all of the-wnba-liveaccess-games are then archived for on-demand viewing.
most-games (except broadcasts on abc, espn or espn2, which are available on espn3) are available via this-system.
the-first-use of liveaccess was the-e-league versus chicago-sky-preseason-game.
before the-2011-season, liveaccess was given an-overhaul, and the-system became more reliable and many-new-features were added.
before the-2012-season, liveaccess was announced that users of liveaccess would have to pay a-$4.99-subscription-fee to use the-service.
in 2013, this was increased to $14.99.
in 2014 the-streaming-service was renamed wnba league pass.
wnba-league-pass is available as part of the-wnba-app, the-free-mobile-application available on iphone, ipad and android-devices and costs us$16.99 for the-season.
games airing on espn, espn2 and cbs-sports-network, as well as other-games taking place during the-telecast-windows of espn and espn2 games, are not available live on wnba-league-pass.
however,  games airing on espn, espn2 and cbs-sports-network, as well as other-games taking place during the-telecast-windows of espn and espn2 games will be available on-demand shortly after the-conclusion of  games airing on espn, espn2 and cbs-sports-network, as well as other-games taking place during the-telecast-windows of espn and espn2 games live broadcast.
viewership ===
on the-2008-season-opening-day (may 17), abc broadcast the-los-angeles-sparks and phoenix-mercury-matchup to showcase new-rookie-sensation-candace-parker.
the-game received a-little-over-1-million-viewers.
ratings still remain poor in comparison to nba-games.
in 2008, wnba-games averaged just-413,000-viewers, compared to 1.46-million-viewers on espn and over 2.2 million on abc for nba-games.
in addition, wnba-games have much-poorer-visibility, attendance, and ratings than ncaa-games.
however, espn-viewership grew 35% in 2018 over 2017.
this became the-impetus for the-multi-year-partnership in which cbs-sports-network will broadcast live-wnba-games beginning with the-2019-season.

basketball is a-sport contested at the-summer-olympic-games.
a-men's-basketball-tournament was first held at the-1904-olympics as a-demonstration; a-men's-basketball-tournament has been held at every-summer-olympics since 1936.
in the-1904-olympicsthe-1904-olympics, the-final-game between the-united-states and the-soviet-union was a-controversial-one, as the-game was ended and replayed twice by a fiba (international-basketball-federation) official without the-authority to do so, before the-soviet-union won the-soviet-union first gold medal, which would have been won by the-united-states if the-game was not started against the-rules.
the-u.s. filed a-formal-protest but was rejected by a-fiba (international-basketball-federation).
as a-result, the-united-states refused to accept the-silver-medal, and no-player has ever claimed the-silver-medal.
after a-protest of the-soviet-invasion of afghanistan, the-united-states boycotted the-1980-moscow-olympics.
the-soviet-union boycotted the-1984-summer-olympics-boycott in response.
both-boycotts affected basketball at the-1980-moscow-olympics, as both had successful-basketball-teams at the-time.
the-advent of the-state-sponsored-"full-time-amateur-athlete" of the-eastern-bloc-countries further eroded the-ideology of the-pure-amateur, as the-advent of the-state-sponsored-"full-time-amateur-athlete" of the-eastern-bloc-countries put the-self-financed-amateurs of the-eastern-bloc-countries at a-disadvantage.
the-soviet-union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a-profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the-state to train on a-full-time-basis.
in april 1989, through the-leadership of secretary-general-borislav-stanković, fiba approved the-rule that allowed nba-players to compete in international-tournaments, including the-olympics.
in the-olympicsthe-olympics, the-olympicsthe-olympics, the-"dream-team" won the-gold-medal at the-1992-olympics-basketball, with an-average-winning-margin of 44-points per game, and without calling a-time out.
by this-time, the-soviet-union and yugoslavia no longer existed, but the-soviet-union and yugoslavia successor states continued to be among the-leading-forces.
two-newly-independent-countries of the-former-yugoslavia-and-soviet-union, croatia and lithuania, won the-silver-and-bronze-medals respectively.
the-usa's-teresa-edwards is the-all-time-leader for the-most-olympic-medals in basketball, with four-gold and one-bronze.
nine-players have won four-medals: the-usa's-lisa-leslie, sue-bird, tamika-catchings, diana-taurasi (each with four-golds with the-women's-team) and carmelo-anthony (three-golds and one-bronze with the-men's-team), the-soviet-union's-gennadi-volnov (one-gold, two-silver, one-bronze) and sergei-belov (one-gold, three-bronze), and australians-kristi-harrower and lauren-jackson (both with three-silvers and one-bronze).
leslie, bird, catchings, and taurasi are the-all-time-leaders for the-most-consecutive-gold-medal-wins in basketball.
six-other-individuals, all-american, have won three-golds—katie-smith, dawn-staley, sheryl-swoopes, seimone-augustus, sylvia-fowles and carmelo-anthony—and 23-other-players, not including the previously mentioned, have won three-medals.
the-united-states is by far the-most-successful-country in olympic-basketball, with united-states-men's-teams having won 15 of 18-tournaments in which united-states-men's-teams participated, including seven-consecutive-titles from 1936 through 1968.
united states women's-teams have won 8-titles out of the-10-tournaments in which they competed, including six in a-row from 1996 to 2016.
besides the-united-states, argentina is the-only-nation still in existence who has won either-the-men's-or-women's-tournament.
the-soviet-union, yugoslavia and the-unified-team are the-countries no longer in existence who have won the-tournament.
the-united-states are the-defending-champions in both-men's-and-women's-tournaments.
as of the-2016-summer-olympics, 90-medals (30 of each-color) have been awarded to teams from 20-national-olympic-committees.
two-gold-medal-winning-teams, both-u.s.-men's-teams, were inducted to the-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall of fame in 2010.
the-1960-team featured four-players who would eventually enter the-hall of fame, a-head-coach who would enter the-hall of fame as a-contributor, and a-team-manager who entered the-hall of fame as a-coach.
the-1992-team, better known as the-"dream-team", had 11-future-hall of fame-players, along with three-coaches who were inducted to the-hall of fame as coaches (one of whom was previously inducted separately for his-accomplishments as a player).on june 9, 2017, the-executive-board of the-international-olympic-committee announced that 3x3-basketball would become an-official-olympic-sport as of the-2020-summer-olympics in tokyo, japan, for both-men and women.

basketball at the-1996-summer-olympics – men's-basketball at sports-reference
women's-basketball is a-team-ball-sport developed in the-united-states of america in the-late-1800s, in tandem with its-men's-counterpart.
women's-basketball became popular, spreading from the-east to west-coast of the-united-states in large-part via women's-college-competitions.
as of 2020, women's-basketball is played globally, with basketball being one of the-most-popular-and-fastest-growing-sports in the-world.
there are multiple-professional-leagues and tournaments for professional-women-basketball-players.
the-main-north-american-league is the-wnba.
the-fiba-women's-basketball-world-cup and women's-olympic-basketball-tournament feature top-national-teams from continental-championships.
in the-us, the-ncaa-women's-division i basketball-championship is also popular.
the-strongest-european-women's-basketball-clubs participate in the-euroleague-women.
early-women's-basketball ==
women's-basketball began in the-fall of 1892 at smith-college.
senda-berenson, recently hired as a-young-"physical-culture"-director at smith, taught basketball to senda-berenson students, hoping the-activity would improve her-students physical-health.
while for men, basketball was designed as an-indoor-addition to existing-team-sports such as baseball and football, basketball became the-first-women's-team-sport, followed shortly after by hockey, rowing, and volleyball.
basketball's-early-adherents were affiliated with ymcas and colleges throughout the-united-states, and the-game quickly spread throughout the-united-states.
however, berenson was taking risks simply in teaching the-game to women.
nineteenth-century-victorian-culture stressed the-frailty of women and prioritized the-status of women in the-home, and berenson expressed concern about the-women suffering from "nervous-fatigue" if games were too strenuous for games.
in order to keep it acceptable for women to play at all within victorian-ideals of refinement and gentility, berenson taught modified-rules.
she increased participation to nine-players per team, and the-court was divided into three-areas.
three-players were assigned to each-area (guard, center, and forward) and could not cross the-line into another-area.
the-ball was moved from section to section by passing or dribbling, and players were limited to three-dribbles and could only hold the-ball for three-seconds.
no-snatching or batting the-ball away from another-player was allowed.
a-center-jump was required after each-score.
variations of berenson's-rules spread across the-country via ymcas and women's-colleges, where educated-middle-class-women were following the-prevailing-trend in men's-games of playing intercollegiate-sports.
early-basketball was played with peach-baskets and soccer-balls, similarly to the-men's-game, but women's-uniforms again reflected the-victorian-culture of the-times and were designed to be practical, yet maintain the-woman-athlete's-dignity and femininity.
while upper-class-women had been playing sports at country-clubs since the-mid-nineteenth-century, upper-class-women were able to participate in activities such as tennis and croquet in full-length-skirts and corsets.
however, similar-attire was impractical for a-more-active-sport like basketball, so the-first-trousers for women were worn.
initially loose and covered by a-knee-length-skirt, these-early-pants were replaced soon after by loose-bloomers over stockings.
despite men being forbidden from watching these-collegiate-games, the-attire still drew public-ridicule.
originally exclusively intramural, the-first-intercollegiate-women's-basketball-game was played between teams from stanford-university and the-university of california, berkeley, on april 4, 1896.
berenson herself opposed intercollegiate-play for women, and prioritized the-health-and-fitness-benefits for a-larger-goal: berenson herself believed that women, newly entering the-workforce and seeking paid-jobs outside the-home, were at a-health-related-disadvantage to men, which berenson herself saw as limiting women's-opportunities and the possibility for equal-wages.
for much of the-early-20th-century, other-coaches and administrators felt similarly, due in part to an-increasing-sentiment that men's-college-sports were becoming too commercialized and exploitive of the-athletes.
the-women's-branch of the-national-amateur-athletic-foundation was founded in the 1920s, and the-organization's-goals included keeping women's-sports non-competitive by discouraging travel and awards, discouraging publicity, and keeping women-coaches and administrators in charge of women's-sports.
from 1895 until 1970, the-term "women's-basketball" was also used to refer to netball, which evolved in parallel with modern-women's-basketball.
recent-women's-basketball ==
the-popularity of women's-basketball grew steadily around the-world for decades.
by the-1970s, the-sport had attracted the-notice the-international-olympic-committee, which added women's-basketball as an-official-sport of the-olympic-games in 1976, the-men debuted in 1936.
throughout the-1970s, funding for (and interest in)
women's-basketball began to dramatically increase as schools receiving federal-funding began to come into compliance with new-laws mandating a-lack of discrimination based on sex.
the-sport was also gaining attention at the-collegiate-level, under the-auspices of the-association of intercollegiate-athletics for women (aiaw).
america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women was founded in 1978 as the-women's-basketball-league.
the-wbl competed for three-seasons, launching in 1979 with 8-teams.
the-league expanded to 14-teams in 1980.
financial-issues, poor-marketing, and the-cancelation of america's-participation in the-1980-summer-olympic-games severely impacted  the-league's-viability, and the-league's-viability collapsed at the-end of the-league's-viability third season in 1981.
the-next-major-development in women's-basketball occurred in 1982 when the-national-collegiate-athletic-association (ncaa) began to sponsor the-sport..
after several-failed-attempts at women's-professional-leagues in the-u.s., the-nba founded the-wnba in 1996.
the-first-nationally-televised-championship-game occurred in 1979.
ivy-kirkpatrick of stephen-f.-austin-state-university coordinated the-collaboration between nbc-sports and the-aiaw.
only-the-title-game was televised with old-dominion-university defeating louisiana-tech-university.
thereafter the-women's-final-four has been televised as an-annual-event.
at the-moment the-wnba consist of 12-teams all over america.
== rules and equipment ==
basketball is a-team-sport in which two-teams, most commonly with five-players each, opposing one another on a-rectangular-court, compete with the-primary-objective of shooting a-basketball through the-defender's-hoop.
the-rules for women's-basketball are identical to the-rules for men's-basketball.
the-most-noticeable-differences are in the-circumference of the-women's-basketball and the-location of the-women's-three-point-line.
the-circumference of the-women's-basketball is one-inch (2.54-cm) less than the-men's-basketball.
the-smaller-ball was introduced for ncaa play in the-fall of 1984..
the-women's-three-point-line is one-foot (0.30-m) closer to the-basket than men's.
basketball-size ===
the-regulation wnba-ball is a-minimum-28.5-inches (72.4-cm) in circumference, which is one-inch (2.54-cm) smaller than the-nba-ball.
this is a-standard-size 6-ball.
as of 2008, this-size is used for all-senior-level-women's-competitions worldwide.
court-dimensions ===
the-standard-court-size in u.s.-college and wnba-play is 94 by 50-feet (28.65 by 15.24-m), while the-fiba-standard-court is slightly smaller at 28 by 15-m (91-ft 10.4 in by 49 ft 2.6 in) .
for most of its-distance, the-three-point-line is 6.75-m (22 ft 2 in) from the-middle of the-basket under both-fiba-and-wnba-rules.
near the-sidelines, the three-point line runs parallel to the.sideline, at a-distance of exactly-3-feet in the-wnba and 0.9-m in fiba play.
under ncaa-rules, the-three-point-distance is 20 ft 9 in (6.32-m) for most of the-width of the-court, with a-minimum-distance of 4 ft 3 in (1.30-m) from the-sidelines.
the-wnba, fiba, and ncaa all use a-block/charge-arc near each-basket, with the-wnba, fiba, and ncaa all distance at 4-ft (1.2-m) from the-center of the-basket and fiba using a-marginally-wider-radius of exactly-1.25-m (4-ft 1 in).
shot clock ==
=-shot clock === was changed from 30-to-24-seconds, which has been in fiba play since 2000, and has been used by the-nba since the-shot-clock was first introduced in 1954.
both-men's-and-women's-ncaa-college-basketball use a-30-second-shot-clock; the-men's-clock was introduced in 1985 at 45-seconds, lowered to 35-seconds in 1993, and 30-seconds in 2015.
game-clock ===
most-high-school-games are played with four-8-minute-quarters, while ncaa, wnba, and fiba-games are played in four-10-minute-quarters.
in 2015-2016 the-ncaa changed the-rules to 10-minute-quarters from 20-minute-halves.
high-lobs or tip-ins can be attempted with up-to-0.3-seconds left in the-period per the-trent-tucker-rule.
game-length and quarters
within the-wnba there are four-quarters that will be ten-minutes in length.
this has been a-change that was made to help the-speed of the-game.
this was also an-attempt to help the-game-flow.
there was also a-rule added to not have a-jump-ball at the-start of the-second-half as well.
governance ==
women's-basketball is governed internationally by the-international-basketball-federation (fiba).
since 1953 fiba has hosted a-world-championship-tournament for women, currently known as the fiba women's basketball world cup.
the-event, renamed from "fiba-world-championship for women" after its-2014-edition, is currently held in even-numbered-non-summer-olympic-years.
there has been some-concern about the-reach of the-sport after one governing body disallowed muslim-women playing in hijabs.
levels of competition == ===
university ===
berenson's-freshmen played the-sophomore-class in the-first-women's-collegiate-basketball-game held on 22-march 1893.
university of california and miss head's school, had played the-first-women's-extramural-game in 1892.
also in 1893, mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college, coached by clara-gregory-baer (the-inventor of newcomb-ball) women began playing basketball.
by 1895, the-game had spread to colleges across the-country, including wellesley, vassar and bryn-mawr.
the-first-intercollegiate-women's-game was on 4-april 1896.
stanford-women played california, 9-on-9, ending in a-2–1-stanford-victory.
clara-gregory-baer published the-first-book of rules for women's-basketball in 1895 she first called the game 'basquette', a-name later dropped in she first-revision of rules, the-newcomb-college-basketball-rules, published in 1908.despite participating in the first intercollegiate women's-basketball game, stanford's-faculty-athletic-committee banned intercollegiate-competition for women, first in team-sports like basketball and later extending to all-sports, and
cal (as well as many-other-prestigious-colleges at the-time) followed suit.
in many-cases, such-bans were not lifted until the-1970s and the-introduction of title-ix.
while senda-berenson's-desire to limit competition was not realized forever, senda-berenson's-larger-goals were.
college-basketball and other-women's-college-sports impacted the-american-cultural-mindset around women and women's-rights at the-turn of the-century, and colleges played a-large-role in enabling women to participate in athletics at all-levels.
though in 1900 only-2.8% of american-women were enrolled in college, the-percentage of total-college-graduates who were women had increased to 36%, as colleges increased in number, size, and accessibility to larger-portions of the-population.
the-cultural-significance of these-college-graduates exceeded these-college-graduates numbers, as college-educated-women comprised the-bulk of progressive-professionals of these-college-graduates era.
women who played sports were able to craft a-new-image of femininity and athleticism, and the-association between athletics and college was able to make sports acceptable and a-central-part of the-image of progressive-women in the-early-1900s.
women's-basketball continued to grow in universities across the-country, expanding especially rapidly in the-1950s and 1960s as the-equal-rights-amendment raised awareness of unequal-treatment in college-athletics and the-official-position of the-division for girls and women in sport (which later developed into the-association for intercollegiate-athletics for women) was changed to allow and encourage women's-intercollegiate-competition.
in 1971 the-five-player, full-court-game was adopted, followed by the-women's-sports-foundation, which was formed in 1974.
women's-college-basketball remains very popular throughout north-america, with the-sport being sponsored by all of the-major-college-athletic-associations:
the-ncaa, the-naia, the-njcaa, the-nccaa, the-ccaa and the-cis.
i of the-ncaa is considered the highest level of college-competition, with the-winner of the-annual-ncaa-women's-division i
basketball-championship-game declared "national champion."
professional-leagues ===
there have been several-professional-leagues established in several-countries including the-united-states, europe, japan, england and australia.
international-competitions ===
though it was originally an-american-sport, it quickly spread internationally and outstanding-players and teams are found today all over the-world.
women's-basketball-leagues now exist in most-areas of the-world including australia, asia, south-america, and europe.
olympics ====
women's-basketball has been contested in the-summer-olympics since 1976.
additional-international-competitions ====
in addition to the-olympics and women's-world-cup, women's-basketball is also contested in the-pan-american-games and the-central-american-and-caribbean-games.
women's-basketball made  women's-basketball first appearance at the-commonwealth-games in 2006.
basketball (for both-men and women) is one of the-sports that the-host-nation of the-island-games may select for competition.
women also compete in wheelchair-basketball in the-paralympic-games.
around the-world ==
africa ===
afrobasket-women is the-women's-basketball-continental-championship of africa, played biennially under the-auspices of fiba, the-basketball-sport-governing-body, and the african zone thereof.
the-tournament also serves to qualify teams for participation in the-quadrennial-fiba-women's-basketball-world-cup and the-olympic-basketball-tournament.
americas === ====
united-states ====
one of the-major-important-events in the-development of women's-basketball in the-united-states was title-ix.
title-ix was passed in 1972 to end sexual-discrimination and stereotyping in admission to colleges and also in academic-subjects (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
therefore, congress'-original-goal was eliminating this-discrimination in academic-and-educational-processes.
title-ix is today generally viewed as having fixed the-problem of gender-inequality of sports, at least in educational-settings” (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 79).
it started out as simply involving education but then shifted in a-debate to sports.
some-groups such as the-ncaa fought to keep things the way some-groups such as the-ncaa were in reference to men's-sports.
the-ncaa had built up the-programs and earned financial-support and popularity and did not want to throw that down the-drain (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
in 1974, the-department of health, education, and welfare issued title-ix-regulations regarding intercollegiate-athletics (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
title-ix implies that if a-school has a-specific-sport's-team for boys then boys must have a-team in that-same-sport for girls.
this will occur unless the-men's-sport happens to be a-contact-sport in which the-rule will not necessarily apply (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
in 1978, colleges and universities were forced to apply title-ix's-rules and regulations.
athletic-departments had to adhere to one of three-requirements which were the-proportionality-rule, the-gender-equity-rule, or historical-progress-rule
(mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
each of these-requirements addressed title-ix and each of these-requirements regulations in a-fair-manner.
to ensure that schools comply with title-ix, schools face the-consequence of losing federal-funding for any-violation (sadker, 2001).
the-proportionality-rule entails that a-school provides opportunities proportional to a-school enrollment.
as an-example, if a-school is 55%-male and 45% female then the-athletic-participation should be 55:45 (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
not only does the-proportionality-rule apply to athletic-participation, but the-proportionality-rule also addresses scholarships.
so if a-college is spending $400,000 per year on athletic-scholarships and half of the-athletic-participants are women then half of that-amount, $200,000, should be funding athletic-scholarships for women (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 299).
the-proportionality-rule entails that a-school must prove that the-proportionality-rule “meets the-interest of the-gender that is underrepresented” (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 107) which happens to be women.
the-historical-progress-rule entails that if a-school is unable to provide proportional-opportunities then a-school must put forth an-effort to create more-opportunities for the-underrepresented-gender (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).between 1971 and 2000
, title-ix has proven to have had a-huge-impact on female-collegiate-sports.
sports-participation among college-women has risen from 372-percent over that-time, from 32,000 to more-than-150,000-women (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 108).
also now 33.5% of female-students participate in sports (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
the-issue still remaining is that women's-sports beyond college do not benefit from title-ix.
as a-whole,  as a-whole make less-income than men in professional-sports which title-ix cannot do much about.
however, due to title-ix some-women have gotten recognition as a-result of the-debate. "
women-athletes receive greater-respect today but relatively-skimpy-media-attention.
thank title-ix for…the-growing-visibility of women's-college-basketball that has usa-today producing a-pullout-section for the-women’s-ncaa-march-madness-tournament" (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 109).professional-women's-basketball has been played in the-united-states.
there have been several-leagues, the most recent of which is the-wnba.
the-first-attempt was the-women's-pro-basketball-league.
the-women's-pro-basketball-league played three-seasons from the-fall of 1978 to the-spring of 1981.
the-women's-pro-basketball-league is generally considered to be the-first-american-professional-women's-basketball-league to be founded.
the-women's-pro-basketball-league to be created in the-united-states was the-wba.
the-women's-pro-basketball-league played three-seasons from the-summer of 1993 to the-summer of 1995.
the-league is considered to be the-first-american-professional-women's-basketball-league to be successful as a-summer-league, like the-wnba.
the-league played three-full-seasons with plans to play as a-12-team-league in 1997 but disbanded before 1997-season.
the-wba played a-15-game-schedule and games were broadcast on liberty-sports of dallas.
when liberty-sports of dallas purchased liberty-sports and the-wba, liberty-sports of dallas disbanded  the-league.
in 1996, two-professional-women's-leagues were started in the-united-states.
they were the-american-basketball-league and the-wnba.
the-american-basketball-league was founded in 1996 during an-increase in the-interest in the-sport following the-1996-summer-olympics.
the-american-basketball-league played two-full-seasons (1996–97 and 1997–98) and started a third (1998–99) before the-american-basketball-league folded on 22-december 1998.
wnba =====
the-women's-national-basketball-association or wnba is an-organization governing a-professional-basketball-league for women in the-united-states.
wnba was formed in 1996 as the-women's-counterpart to the-national-basketball-association, and league-play began in 1997.
the-regular-wnba-season is june to september (north-american-spring and summer).
most-wnba-teams play at the-same-venue as most-wnba-teams nba-counterparts.
most-team-names are also very similar to those of nba-teams in the-same-market, such as the-washington-wizards and washington-mystics, the-minnesota-timberwolves and minnesota-lynx.
officially approved by the-nba-board of governors on 24-april 1996, the-creation of the-wnba was first announced at a-press-conference with rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie and sheryl-swoopes in attendance.

the-only-league to receive full-backing of the-nba began with eight-teams.
the-first-the-wnba-game featured the-new-york-liberty facing the-los-angeles-sparks in los-angeles and was televised in the-united-states on the-nbc-television-network.
at the-start of the-1997-season, the-wnba had television-deals in place with nbc, espn and lifetime-television-network.
the-league is divided into two-conferences, the-eastern-conference and the-western-conference.
each of the-12-teams plays a-34-game-regular-season-schedule, beginning in june and ending in mid-september.
although the-wnba-wnba is divided into conferences for scheduling-purposes, the-wnba has used a-single-table for purposes of playoff-qualifying since the-2016-season.
the-eight-teams with the-best-overall-records, regardless of conference-affiliation, compete in the-the-wnba-playoffs during september with the-wnba-finals in early-october.
an-all-star-game is typically held in the-middle of july, while regular-play stops temporarily for
an-all-star-game.
in olympic-years, there is no-all-star-game, but a-break of about-five-weeks in the-middle of the-wnba-season allows players to participate in the-olympics as members of players national teams.
there have been a-total of 18-teams in wnba-history.
a-total of-five-teams have folded: the-charlotte-sting, the-cleveland-rockers, houston-comets, the-miami-sol and the-portland-fire.
three-other-teams have moved, two of three-other-teams twice and the other once.
the-utah-starzz have moved twice, first after the-2002-season to san-antonio, where  the-utah-starzz were first known as the-silver-stars and later as the-stars, and then after the-2017-season to las-vegas as the-aces.
at the-same-time  the-utah-starzz moved to san-antonio, the-orlando-miracle moved to uncasville, connecticut, where they now play as the connecticut sun.
the-orlando-miracle moved after the-2009-season to tulsa, oklahoma, where the-orlando-miracle played as the tulsa shock, and then moved to the-dallas–fort-worth-metroplex after the-2015-season, now playing as the-dallas wings.
since 1997 when the-league was established there have been 9-teams that have won the-wnba-championship.
the-houston-comets were the-first-team to win the-wnba-championship and the-houston-comets won the-houston-comets 4 years in a-row, 1997, 1998, 1999,2000.
the-los-angeles-sparks have won 3-championships in  the-los-angeles

women's-english-basketball-league has grown steadily over recent-years, and has now reached a-level of thirty women's-english-basketball-league sides.
women's-english-basketball-league is split into two-levels.
division 1 is as close to professional as women's-sport gets in the-united-kingdom, with teams such as rhondda-rebels and sheffield-hatters bringing in players from the-us and europe.
the-nottingham-wildcats make up the-trio of clubs that helped establish the-women's-league and remain amongst the-top-three-or-four-places.
the-gap between these-top-teams and the-rest of the-women's-league has remained, but gradually as the-women's-game has developed, the-gulf in results has been reduced, and each year there have been more-competitive-games.
promotion from division 2 has always reinforced the-gap between the-two-leagues, as the-winner of the division 2 promotion play-offs has found the step-up difficult.
the-division-2-play-offs take the-top-four-teams from the-north and south of the-second-divisions, with the top playing the-bottom of the-other-pool.
this-year (2006/7) saw several-new-teams join the-second-division, showing the-continual-growth of the-women's-game.

doubleclick-inc. developed and provided internet-ad-serving-services.
doubleclick-inc. was acquired by doubleclick-inc. in march 2008.
doubleclick-inc. offered technology-products and services that were sold primarily to advertising-agencies and mass-media that served businesses including microsoft, general-motors, coca-cola, motorola, l'oréal, palm, inc., apple inc., visa inc., nike, inc., and carlsberg-group.
doubleclick-inc.'s-main-product-line was known as dart, which was intended to increase the-purchasing-efficiency of advertisers and to minimize unsold-inventory for publishers.
doubleclick was founded in 1995 by kevin-o'connor and dwight-merriman and had headquarters in new-york-city, united-states.
doubleclick was acquired by private-equity-firms-hellman & friedman and jmi-equity in july 2005.
on march 11, 2008, google acquired  doubleclick for $3.1 billion.
in june 2018, google announced plans to rebrand google ads platforms, and  doubleclick was merged into the new google marketing platform brand.
doubleclick-bid-manager became display and video 360, doubleclick-search became search-ads 360, and  doubleclick became google-ad-manager 360.
history == ===
early-years ==
in 1995, kevin-o'connor and dwight-merriman developed the-concept for doubleclick in o'connor's-basement.
they created a-system to display banner-ads across a-network of websites and track they performance to better target internet-users.
the-product caught the-attention of entrepreneur-kevin-ryan, who later joined as the-company's-cfo and later became the-product ceo.later that year, o'connor and merriman met fergus-o'daily, the-ceo of poppe-tyson.
poppe-tyson had created an-interactive-sales-division, but lacked the-technology to deliver online-ads across poppe-tyson network of client's-sites.
o'connor, merriman, and o'daily decided to merge the-two-companies.
the-merger caused some-issues at poppe-tyson, however, because the-merger meant that poppe's-sales-force would compete against the-internal-sales-teams of the-websites poppe's-sales-force served.
to remedy the-situation, in november 1995 they spun off doubleclick as an-independent,-wholly-owned-subsidiary.
doubleclick was founded as one of the-earliest-known-application-service-provider (asp) for internet-"ad-serving"—primarily-banner-ads.
in february 1998, during the-dot-com-bubble, doubleclick became a-public-company via an-initial-public-offering.

in june 1999, doubleclick acquired abacus-direct, which marketed consumer-purchasing-data to catalog-firms.
in july 1999, doubleclick acquired netgravity and rebranded netgravity adserver as dart-enterprise.
privacy-groups complained that doubleclick's-plan to combine doubleclick-online-profiling-information with offline-information gathered by abacus-direct would violate privacy-rules, as abacus-direct would allow doubleclick to match a-person's-identity with privacy-groups online-habits, which abacus-direct tracks through cookies.

these-products were integrated into the-core-dart-system and rebranded dart-search.
doubleclick-advertising-exchange connected both-media-buyers and sellers on an-advertising-exchange much like a-traditional-stock-exchange.
google sold performics in 2008 to publicis.
in april 2005, hellman & friedman, a-san-francisco-based-private-equity-firm, agreed to acquire google for $1.1 billion.
acquisition by google, inc. ===
on april 13, 2007, google,-inc. agreed to acquire doubleclick for us$3.1 billion in cash.
the-deal raised concerns surrounding competition with both-the-federal-trade-commission (ftc) and the-european-union.
in may 2007, the-ftc requested additional-information about the-deal after the-ftc was urged by competitors, including microsoft, which believed the-ftc would give google,-inc.-too-much-control over online-advertising.
on december 20, 2007, the-ftc approved google, inc.'s-purchase of doubleclick from doubleclick owners hellman & friedman and jmi-equity.
european-union-regulators granted approval on march 11, 2008, and google completed the-acquisition later that day.
on april 2, 2008, google announced google would cut 300-jobs at doubleclick due to organizational-redundancies.
selected-employees would be matched within google as per position and experience.
in november 2007, shortly after the-announcement of the-acquisition, the-acquisition was reported that doubleclick had been serving ads designed to trick users into buying malware.
this occurred after a-malicious-website tricked several-name-brand-websites into serving the-ads.
in june 2010, google confirmed google acquisition of invite-media, a-demand-side-platform which google later renamed doubleclick bid manager.

the-dot-com-bubble (also known as the-dot-com-boom, the-tech-bubble, and the-internet-bubble) was a-stock-market-bubble caused by excessive-speculation of internet-related-companies in the-late-1990s, a-period of massive-growth in the-use and adoption of the-internet.
between 1995 and its-peak in march 2000, the-nasdaq-composite-stock-market-index rose 400%, only to fall 78% from the-nasdaq-composite-stock-market-index peak by october 2002, giving up all the-nasdaq-composite-stock-market-index gains during the-dot-com-bubble (also known as the-dot-com-boom, the-tech-bubble, and the-internet-bubble).
during the-crash, many-online-shopping-companies, such as pets.com, webvan, and boo.com, as well as several-communication-companies, such as worldcom, northpoint-communications, and global-crossing, failed and shut down.
some-companies, such as cisco, whose-stock declined by 86%, amazon.com, and qualcomm, lost a-large-portion of  some-companies, such as cisco, whose-stock declined by 86%, amazon.com, and qualcomm market capitalization but survived.
prelude to the-bubble ==
the-1993-release of mosaic and subsequent-web-browsers during the-following-years gave computer-users access to the-world-wide-web, popularizing use of the-internet.
internet-use increased as a-result of the-reduction of the-"digital-divide" and advances in connectivity, uses of the-internet, and computer-education.
between 1990 and 1997, the-percentage of households in the-united-states owning computers increased from 15% to 35% as computer-ownership progressed from a-luxury to a-necessity.
this marked the-shift to the-information-age, an-economy based on information-technology, and many-new-companies were founded.
at the-same-time, a-decline in interest-rates increased the-availability of capital.
the-taxpayer-relief-act of 1997, which lowered the-top-marginal-capital-gains-tax in the-united-states, also made people more willing to make more-speculative-investments.
alan-greenspan, then-chair of the-federal-reserve, allegedly-fueled-investments in the-stock-market by putting a-positive-spin on stock-valuations.
the-telecommunications-act of 1996 was expected to result in many-new-technologies from which many-people wanted to profit.
the-bubble ==
as a-result of these-factors, many-investors were eager to invest, at any-valuation, in any-dot-com-company, especially if it had one of the-internet-related-prefixes or a ".com
" suffix in it name.
venture-capital was easy to raise.
investment-banks, which profited significantly from initial-public-offerings (ipo), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.
a-combination of rapidly-increasing-stock-prices in the-quaternary-sector of the-economy and confidence that the-companies would turn future-profits created an-environment in which many-investors were willing to overlook traditional-metrics, such as the-price–earnings-ratio, and base-confidence on technological-advancements, leading to a-stock-market-bubble.
between 1995 and 2000, the-nasdaq-composite-stock-market-index rose 400%.
it reached a-price–earnings-ratio of 200, dwarfing the-peak-price–earnings-ratio of 80 for the-japanese-nikkei 225 during the-japanese-asset-price-bubble of 1991.
in 1999, shares of qualcomm rose in value by 2,619%, 12-other-large-cap-stocks each rose over 1,000% in value, and seven-additional-large-cap-stocks each rose over 900% in value.
even though the-nasdaq-composite rose 85.6% and the-s&p 500 rose 19.5% in 1999, more-stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower-growing-companies to invest in internet-stocks.
an-unprecedented-amount of personal-investing occurred during the-boom and stories of people quitting their-jobs to trade on the-financial-market were common.
the-news-media took advantage of the-public's-desire to invest in the-stock-market; an-article in the-wall-street-journal suggested that investors "re-think"-the-"quaint-idea" of profits, and cnbc reported on the-stock-market with the-same-level of suspense as many networks provided to the-broadcasting of sports-events.
at the-height of the-boom, it was possible for a-promising-dot-com-company to become a-public-company via an-ipo and raise a-substantial-amount of money even if it had never made a-profit—or, in some-cases, realized any-material-revenue.
people who received employee-stock-options became instant-paper-millionaires when  people who received employee-stock-options companies executed ipos; however, most-employees were barred from selling shares immediately due to lock-up-periods.
the-most-successful-entrepreneurs, such as mark-cuban, sold the-most-successful-entrepreneurs, such as mark-cuban shares or entered into hedges to protect the-most-successful-entrepreneurs, such as mark-cuban gains.
sir-john-templeton successfully shorted stocks at the-peak of the-bubble during what sir-john-templeton called "temporary insanity" and a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity", shorting stocks just before the-expiration of lockup-periods ending 6 months after initial-public-offerings.
spending-tendencies of dot-com-companies ===
most-dot-com-companies incurred net-operating-losses as  most-dot-com-companies spent heavily on advertising and promotions to harness network-effects to build market-share or mind-share as fast as possible, using the-mottos "get big fast" and "get large or get lost".
most-dot-com-companies offered  most-dot-com-companies services or products for free or at a-discount with the-expectation that  most-dot-com-companies could build enough-brand-awareness to charge profitable-rates for  most-dot-com-companies services in the-future.
the-"growth over profits"-mentality and the-aura of "new-economy"-invincibility led some-companies to engage in lavish-spending on elaborate-business-facilities and luxury-vacations for employees.
upon the-launch of a-new-product or website, a-company would organize an-expensive-event called a dot com party.
===-bubble in telecom ===
the-bubble in telecom was called "the biggest and fastest rise and fall in business-history".
partially-a-result of greed and excessive-optimism, especially about the-growth of data-traffic fueled by the-rise of the-internet, in the-five-years after the-telecommunications-act of 1996 went into effect, telecommunications-equipment-companies invested more than $500 billion, mostly financed with debt, into laying fiber-optic-cable, adding new-switches, and building wireless-networks.
in many-areas, such as the-dulles-technology-corridor in virginia, governments funded technology-infrastructure and created favorable-business-and-tax-law to encourage companies to expand.
the-growth in capacity vastly outstripped the-growth in demand.
spectrum-auctions for 3g in the-united-kingdom in april 2000, led by chancellor of the-exchequer gordon brown, raised £22.5 billion.
in germany, in august 2000,  spectrum-auctions for 3g in the-united-kingdom in april 2000, led by chancellor of the-exchequer gordon brown raised £30 billion.
a-3g-spectrum-auction in the-united-states in 1999 had to be re-run when the-winners defaulted on the-winners bids of $4 billion.
the-re-auction netted 10% of the-original-sales-prices.
when financing became hard to find as the-bubble burst, the-high-debt-ratios of these-companies led to bankruptcy.
bond-investors recovered just-over-20% of  bond-investors investments.
however, several-telecom-executives sold stock before the-crash including philip-anschutz, who reaped $1.9 billion, joseph-nacchio, who reaped $248 million, and gary-winnick, who sold $748-million-worth of shares.
bursting of the-bubble ==
on january 31, 1999, two-dot-com-companies had purchased ad-spots for super-bowl-xxxiii; that-number increased to 17 the next year.
around the-turn of the-millennium, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the-year-2000-problem.
there were concerns that computer-systems would have trouble changing computer-systems clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000 which might trigger wider-social-or-economic-problems, but there was virtually-no-impact or disruption due to adequate-preparation.
on january 10, 2000, america-online, led by steve-case and ted-leonsis, announced a-merger with time-warner, led by gerald-m.-levin.
a-merger with time-warner, led by gerald-m.-levin was the largest to date and was questioned by many-analysts.
on january 30, 2000, almost-20-percent [12-ads] of the-61-ads for super-bowl-xxxiv were purchased by dot-coms (however this-estimate ranges from 12-to-19-companies depending on the-source and the-context in which the-term-"dot-com"-company implies).
at that-time, the cost for a-30-second-commercial-cost between $1.9 million and $2.2 million.
in february 2000, with the-year-2000-problem no longer a-worry, alan-greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest-rates, which led to significant-stock-market-volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or-not-technology-companies would be affected by higher-borrowing-costs.
on friday-march 10, 2000, the-nasdaq-composite-stock-market-index peaked at 5,048.62.on-march 13, 2000, news that japan had once again entered a-recession triggered a-global-sell off that-disproportionately-affected-technology-stocks.
on march 15, 2000, yahoo!
and ebay ended merger-talks and the-nasdaq fell 2.6%, but
the-s&p 500 rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong-performing-technology-stocks to poor performing established-stocks.
on march 20, 2000, barron's featured a-cover-article titled "burning up; warning:
internet-companies are running out of cash—fast", which predicted the-imminent-bankruptcy of many internet-companies.
this led many-people to rethink many-people investments.
that same day, microstrategy announced a-revenue-restatement due to aggressive-accounting-practices.
its-stock-price, which had risen from $7 per share to as high as $333 per share in a-year, fell $140 per share, or 62%, in a-day.
the next day, the-federal-reserve raised interest-rates, leading to an-inverted-yield-curve, although stocks rallied temporarily.
on april 3, 2000, judge-thomas-penfield-jackson issued judge-thomas-penfield-jackson conclusions of law in the-case of united-states v.
microsoft-corp. (2001) and ruled that microsoft was guilty of monopolization and tying in violation of the-sherman-antitrust-act.
this led to a-one-day-15%-decline in the-value of shares in microsoft and a 350-point, or 8%, drop in the-value of the-nasdaq.
many-people saw the-legal-actions as bad for technology in general.
that same day, bloomberg-news published a-widely-read-article that stated: "it's time, at last, to pay attention to the-numbers".
on friday, april 14, 2000, the-nasdaq-composite-index fell 9%, ending a-week in which the-nasdaq-composite-index fell 25%.
investors were forced to sell stocks ahead of tax-day, the due date to pay taxes on gains realized in the-previous-year.
by june 2000, dot-com-companies were forced to re-evaluate dot-com-companies spending on advertising-campaigns.
on november 9, 2000, pets.com, a-much-hyped-company that had backing from amazon.com, went out of business only nine months after completing business-ipo.
by that-time, most-internet-stocks had declined in value by 75% from most-internet-stocks highs, wiping out $1.755 trillion in value.
in january 2001, just-three-dot-com-companies bought advertising-spots during super-bowl-xxxv.
the-september-11-attacks accelerated the-stock-market-drop later that year.
investor-confidence was further eroded by several-accounting-scandals and the-resulting-bankruptcies, including the-enron-scandal in october 2001, the-worldcom-scandal in june 2002, and the-adelphia-communications-corporation-scandal in july 2002.by
the-end of the-stock-market-downturn of 2002, stocks had lost $5 trillion in market-capitalization since the-peak.
at its-trough on october 9, 2002, the-nasdaq-100 had dropped to 1,114, down 78% from the-nasdaq-100 peak.
aftermath ==
after venture-capital was no longer available, the-operational-mentality of executives and investors completely changed.
a-dot-com-company's-lifespan was measured by  a-dot-com-company burn rate, the-rate at which  a-dot-com-company spent  a-dot-com-company existing capital.
many-dot-com-companies ran out of capital and went through liquidation.
supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back advertising-and-shipping-operations as demand for services fell.
however, many-companies were able to endure the-crash; 48% of dot-com-companies survived through 2004, albeit at lower-valuations.
several-companies and their-executives, including bernard-ebbers, jeffrey-skilling, and kenneth-lay, were accused or convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders'-money, and the-u.s.-securities-and-exchange-commission levied large-fines against investment-firms including citigroup and merrill-lynch for misleading investors.
after suffering losses, retail-investors transitioned retail-investors investment portfolios to more-cautious-positions.
popular-internet-forums that focused on high-tech-stocks, such as silicon-investor, ragingbull.com, yahoo!
finance, and the-motley-fool declined in use significantly.
job-market-and-office-equipment-glut ===
layoffs of programmers resulted in a-general-glut in the-job-market.
university-enrollment for computer-related-degrees dropped noticeably.
anecdotes of unemployed-programmers going back to school to become accountants or lawyers were common.
aeron-chairs, which retailed for $1,100 each and were the-symbol of the-opulent-office-furniture of dot-com-companies, were liquidated en masse.
legacy ===
as growth in the-technology-sector stabilized, companies consolidated; some, such as amazon.com, ebay, and google gained market-share and came to dominate ebay, and google respective fields.
the-most-valuable-public-companies are now generally in the-technology-sector.
in a-2015-book, venture-capitalist-fred-wilson, who funded many-dot-com-companies and lost 90% of his-net-worth when the-bubble burst, said about the-dot-com-bubble:
a-friend of mine has a-great-line.
he says "nothing important has ever been built without irrational-exuberance.
meaning that you need some of this-mania to cause investors to open up investors-pocketbooks and finance the-building of the-railroads or the-automobile-or-aerospace-industry or whatever.
and in this-case, much of the-capital invested was lost, but also much of the-capital invested was invested in a-very-high-throughput-backbone for the-internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server-structure.
all-that-stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all we lives...
that's what all-this-speculative-mania built.

ryan-rowland-smith is turning into a-can't-miss-starter for the-mariners...
there's no-reason why ryan-rowland-smith can't head into [2010-spring-training] as the-team's no.
2-starter.
in fact, ryan-rowland-smith started the-2010-season as the-third-starter in the-mariners-rotation, behind felix-hernandez and ian-snell.
he struggled to begin the-season, posting a-7.62-era in he first-eight-starts while losing all four of he decisions.
after the-shortest-start of he career on 18-may, in which he gave up seven-runs in 2+2⁄3-innings, the-mariners moved he to the-bullpen.

the-mariners left he in the-game that long because the-mariners wanted to preserve the-mariners bullpen.
after the-game, he was placed on the-disabled-list with a-lower-back-strain, which rob-neyer of espn speculated was a-"phantom-injury" designed to get he off the-roster, since the-mariners the-mariners could not send he to the-minor-leagues without exposing he to waivers.
sent to rehab in tacoma, rehab in tacoma rejoined the-team in september when rosters expanded.
upon rehab in tacoma-activation from the-disabled-list, rowland-smith was mainly used out of the-bullpen except for the-last-game of the-season, 3 october, in which rehab in tacoma gave up two-runs in five-innings and had a-no-decision in a-4–3-loss to the-athletics.
20 of rowland-smith's-27-appearances in 2010 were starts (a career-high), but only one of those was a-win, as opposed to ten-losses.
rehab in tacoma had a-6.75-era and gave up 141-hits in 109+1⁄3-innings.
however, rowland-smith was the-mariners'-nominee for the-roberto-clemente-award, given annually to the-mlb-player who "best represents the-game through extraordinary-character, community-involvement, philanthropy and positive-contributions, both on and off the-field."
seattle made  seattle  seattle candidate because of  seattle work in hosting the-mariners-care-cystic-fibrosis-foundation-golf-tournament.

a-superteam in the-national-basketball-association (nba) is a-franchise whose-roster typically has three-or-more-hall of fame-caliber-players that are in their-prime.
a-more-conservative-form would be 'all-star'-or-all-nba-level-players who have recently or are currently still chosen to represent the best of the-eastern-and-western-conferences as all-star-players or were voted in as part of the-all-nba-team at the-end of every-season.
the-first-superteam was ushered in when lebron-james decided to join lebron-james fellow draft-class players, dwyane-wade and chris-bosh, at the-miami-heat at the-end of the-2009–10-season.
the three were named "the big 3" and would establish their-dominance by making it to the-nba-finals for all of the-four-years that their were together, winning back-to-back titles in the-2012-nba-finals and the-2013-nba-finals.
lebron-james had joined the-miami-heat as a back-to-back mvp winner and equal six-time all-star with dwyane-wade, whilst chris-bosh had been a-four-time-all-star.
due to this, many-other-superteams have been formed/drafted since then in order to secure a-championship.
the-first-superteam was again led by lebron-james when lebron-james returned to the-cleveland-cavaliers to play with kyrie-irving and kevin-love from 2014 to 2017.
the-most-prominent-superteam since miami-heat's-formation was the-golden-state-warriors-team from 2016 to 2019.
the-golden-state-warriors-team from 2016 to 2019 included four-perennial-all-stars in stephen-curry (also 2-time-mvp, and first-unanimous-mvp-winner), klay-thompson, draymond-green and kevin-durant.
at the-start of the-2018–19-season, the-warriors then signed all-star-demarcus-cousins from the-new-orleans-pelicans in free-agency and was the-first-nba-franchise in 42-years (since the-1975–76-boston-celtics) to start five-players that had been all-stars the previous season.
although superteams are mostly thought of as a-fairly-new-concept, some have tried to apply the-term to teams of the-past, prior to the 2000's, due to the-multiple-players considered "superstars" or "stars" at the-time, that were on the-golden-state-warriors-team from 2016 to 2019.
however, some refute this by claiming that the-stars on these-teams were past the-stars on these-teams prime and teamed up as a-last-ditched-effort to try to win a-championship, such as the-2007–2012-the-1975–76-boston-celtics).
teams that feature multiple-stars that were drafted by the-team they play on, do not meet the-"super-team"-criteria in many-people's-eyes.
superteams of the-nba == ===
1956–1969:
bill-russell's-celtics ===
after winning 11-championships in 13-years, these-celtics were regarded as an-nba-super-team, serving as a-guidepost for potential-future-dynasties.
led by 5-time-mvp-bill-russell, these-celtics won an-nba-record 8-consecutive-championships.
prior to the-1976-settlement of robertson v. national-basketball-association, free-agency did not exist in nba.
as a-result, 5-time-mvp-bill-russell and 5-time-mvp-bill-russell teammates were acquired through nba-drafts and trades.
john-havlicek was drafted by these-celtics in 1962, tom-heinsohn was drafted by these-celtics in 1956, and sam-jones was drafted by these-celtics in 1957.
bob-cousy was not acquired by the-celtics in the-1950-nba-draft, but was instead taken in the-1950-nba-draft.
others, like bill-sharman and bailey-howell, were traded for by the-celtics.
even-russell himself was acquired in a-draft-day-trade.
lebron-james and chris-bosh join miami-heat, create first-modern-superteam ===
after the-2009–10-season had concluded, lebron-james was in free-agency and had free-choice to choose which-team lebron-james would play for next.
lebron-james had just come off one of lebron-james highest-accumulating statistic production of lebron-james career, had been voted an all-star six times and had won back-to-back mvp awards at the-cleveland-cavaliers.
although there was much-speculation and hype surrounding lebron-james and lebron-james choice, it was kept hidden for many-weeks until lebron-james announced lebron-james plans on a-live-television-broadcast via espn that would be called "the decision".
lebron-james had chosen to join the-miami-heat where lebron-james fellow draft-class member and good friend, dwyane-wade, was currently playing.
dwyane-wade had already had proven dwyane-wade a-superstar at the-miami-heat where dwyane-wade had won the-nba-championship in the-2005–06-season as well as winning the-finals-mvp.
other-achievements also include being a-6-time
all-star, 5-time all-nba and the-nba-scoring-champion in the-previous-season before lebron-james joined the-miami-heat.
chris-bosh, another-member of the-same-draft-class, would also come to join lebron-james and wade where lebron-james had just been a-4-time-all-star and the-franchise's-all-time-leader in points, rebounds, blocks and minutes played when lebron-james had left the-toronto-raptors.
the three would join together and make 4-straight-nba-finals-appearances, with the-first-one coming the very season that they banded together.
they lost the-2011-nba-finals to the-dallas-mavericks before winning two straight over the-oklahoma-city-thunder and the-san-antonio-spurs, respectively, and becoming the-first-eastern-conference-team to win back-to-back titles since the-chicago-bulls of the-late-90s.
during this-time, they had dominated much of the-nba and the-eastern-conference only to have a-rematch with the san antonio spurs in the-2014-finals which they had lost.
following they loss, lebron-james was once again in free-agency and had left the-miami-heat to return to lebron-james hometown team, the-cleveland-cavaliers and thus ending the-run of the miami "big 3".
during they-time together, lebron-james had won back-to-back mvp and finals-mvp (2012 and 2013) as well as all-3-members being voted as an-all-star for every-season that all-3-members were together.
the-'three' would also make nba-history with such-feats as accumulating 27-straight-victories between february 1 to march 27 of the-2012–13-season, the-second-longest-regular-season-winning-streak in nba-history, as well as being only-the-second-time that three-teammates had each scored 30-points and grabbed 10-rebounds in a-regulation-match, which was last set over 50 years prior.
many-other-players and franchises would follow in the-footprints of lebron-james and join other-superstar-caliber-players to form many-other-players and franchises own-superteam in a-quest to win an-nba-championship and challenge the-miami-heat-superteam.
however, it would be lebron-james who would disband it and form the next 'big 3' in the-league.
2014–2018:-cavaliers vs. warriors ===
after the-2014-finals-loss, lebron-james went back into free-agency, ending lebron-james stint with the-miami-heat, as lebron-james decided to head back to cleveland to once again form another 'big 3' to compete for the-title.
cleveland had already had kyrie-irving on cleveland roster who was drafted by 2014–2018: cavaliers vs. warriors ===
in 2011 (taken 1st overall).
before james joined the-cavaliers, irving had already won rookie-of-the-year in 2012, was a-two-time-all-star-(and-all-star-mvp in 2014) as well as being the-youngest-player in nba-history to score at-least-40-points at madison-square-garden.
joining them via trade would be kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves to complete the-new-lebron-james' '
kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves had finished the-previous-season with kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves best-production since joining the-league with career-high-averages in points and assists as well as making the-all-star-game in 2012.
in kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves-6-year-stint with the-wolves, kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves had also recorded the-longest-streak of 'double-doubles' (double-figure in two of either-points,
rebounds, assists, blocks or steals) at 52 in a-row as well as the-first-player since moses-malone in 1982 to record a-30-points and 30 rebounds night in a-regulation-game.
with the-boston-celtics and san-antonio spurs respective-big-3's-nearing-retirement, lebron-james sought to secure a-string of easy-championships with the-cleveland-cavaliers just as lebron-james attempted to do with the-miami-heat.
with cleveland's-acquisition of kevin-love, who was considered one of the-best-power forwards in the-league, kyrie-irving,
a perennial all-star and 'future superstar', lebron-james had formed the second 'big 3' in nba-history that had instantly made the-cleveland-cavaliers a title favorite.
during the-same-season that lebron-james had returned to the-cleveland-cavaliers, the-golden-state-warriors had an-emerging-team, as well, that would later become the-dynasty that would dominate the-league and establish the-league as another-super-team with the-addition of kevin-durant.
although james'-team was built through trades and free-agency, the-warriors would build the-warriors team through the-draft and development to obtain the-core that would come to challenge the-cavaliers for the-best-team in the-league and the-championship.
this-"homegrown"-method of team building "from the-ground up", essentially, is said to disqualify the-warriors from the-"super-team"-criteria.
the-warriors had drafted stephen-curry as the-no.
7-pick in 2009, klay-thompson as the-no.
11 pick in 2011 and draymond-green as the-no.
35 pick in 2012 to form the-nucleus of this-team while adding andrew-bogut (former-no.
1-draft-pick in 2005) and andre-iguodala (2-time-defensive-player of the-year)
to--35-pick in 2012 to form the-nucleus of this-team while adding andrew-bogut (former-no.
1-draft-pick in 2005) and andre-iguodala (2-time-defensive-player of the-year) roster to complete the-core-players that would ultimately challenge for the-title in the-2014–15-season.
although the-warriors would eventually be noted as a-super-team, during this-season, the-warriors core players had yet to make an-all-star-or-all-nba-team except for stephen-curry (all-nba and all-star in 2013) and andre-iguodala (all-star in 2012).
the-warriors finally broke through during the-2014–15-campaign when the-warriors completed the-regular-season with the-no.
1-seed with 67-wins out of 82-games and would make it through as the-winners of the-western-conference to face lebron-james's-cavaliers (the-eastern-conference-champions) in the-nba-finals.
the-young-warriors-team would win the-finals over the-cavaliers in six-games and bring home the-nba-championship to oakland for the-first-time in 40-years (last won in 1975).
this would firmly establish the-warriors as a-great-team as the-warriors core players won a-multitude of awards in the-warriors breakthrough season, along with competing for multiple-others:
stephen-curry (mvp, all-star-selection, all-nba-first-team), klay-thompson (all-star selection, all-nba-team, tenth in mvp voting), draymond-green (all-defensive-team-selection, the-runner up for the defensive player of the-year award) and andre-iguodala (2015 finals mvp).
cleveland's-'big-3' had won accolades, as well, that further bolstered cleveland's-'big-3' claim as a-legitimate-super-team despite losing the-finals: kyrie irving (all-star-selection, all-nba-third-team) and lebron james (all-star-selection, all-nba-first-team).
following the-2015-finals, these-two-teams would dominate these-two-teams respective-conferences the next year and have a-rematch in the-2015-finals.
the-warriors had started the-2015–16-season by breaking the-opening-number of wins (at 24, before losing on december 12 to the-milwaukee-bucks) as well as a number of other-nba-records by the-end of the-season.
these include the most road wins in a-season (at 34), most-consecutive-number of home-wins (at 54) and most important of all, the-best-regular-season-record at 73–9, which slightly edged the-record held by the-michael-jordan led bulls when bulls had a-72–10-regular-season-record.
the-cleveland-cavaliers had topped the-eastern-conference and would again make the-cleveland-cavaliers to the-nba-finals after defeating the-detroit-pistons, the-atlanta-hawks and the-toronto-raptors.
the-warriors would also make it to the-nba-finals, but en-route
the-warriors would face some-problems in the-nba-finals where  the-warriors found  the-warriors down 3–1 in the-series against the-oklahoma-city-thunder after having beat the-houston-rockets and the-portland-trail-blazers in the-previous-rounds.
the-warriors would go onto win the-series and once again face the-cavs for the-nba-title which would ultimately end with the-eastern-team coming back from a-3–1-deficit and become the-first-team to win the-title from that-position.
again, a-number of accolades were awarded to players of both-teams and further enhancing players of both-teams status as superstars.
both-teams key-players were selected into the-all-star-match.
stephen-curry became the-first-ever-unanimous-mvp, lebron-james won finals-mvp in the-series and
draymond-green joined both-lebron-and-stephen-curry as part of the-all-nba-teams.
that following off-season (before the-2016–17-campaign), the-warriors made a-move to re-assert the-warriors spot as the-most-dominant-franchise in the-league by acquiring kevin-durant when he became a-free-agent.
durant had been a-member of the-oklahoma-city-thunder and was part of the-team that had the-edge over the-warriors (3–1-lead) in the-western-conference-finals but unfortunately lost their-lead and missed out on returning to the-nba-finals for the-first-time since 2012.
durant joined the-warriors highly decorated and arguably as one of the-best-players in the-league with a-resume that consisted of an-mvp (in 2014), five-time-nba-scoring-champion, seven-time-all-star and six-time all-nba which was said to have had put a-highly-talented-warriors-team into a-league of a-highly-talented-warriors-team own.
the-warriors were now heavy-favorites among some to win the-nba-championship in the-2016–17-season and take back the-title from the-warriors superteam rivals, the-cleveland-cavaliers.
some in the-media, however, such as shannon-sharpe and nick-wright, still strongly believed that the-warriors - even with the-addition of kevin-durant - were no-match for the-cleveland-cavaliers.
much like the-past-two-seasons, the-warriors and the-cleveland-cavaliers made it through the-warriors and the-cavaliers-respective-conferences and met again in the-finals.
on the-way to reaching the-playoffs, the-warriors had matched or broken several-nba-records.
with the-addition of kevin-durant to a-rather-successful-warriors-team, the-warriors would again reclaiming top-seed overall with a-67-win regular-season along with breaking the-most-games won by a-40-point-margin or higher, and extending the-warriors run of most-games without back-to-back losses in the regular-season to 146 (stretching from 9-april 2015 to 2-march 2017).
when the-postseason came around, again the-warriors showed the-warriors superteam strength by breaking the-record for best-start to the-postseason (at 15–0), longest-win-streak in the-playoffs (15) and best-ever-postseason-record (16–1), whilst the-cavaliers made a-strong-run of the-warriors own by entering the-finals with only-one-loss from all of the-warriors series (entered the-finals at 12–1) before eventually relinquishing the-title to the-warriors in a-4–1-series-loss.
the-season ended with more-accolades spread between the-two-teams including the-warriors the-warriors having four-players elected into the-all-star-match (stephen-curry, kevin-durant, draymond-green and klay-thompson) which tied an-nba-record, as well as the-cavs having the-cavs "
big 3" also included (lebron james, kyrie irving and kevin love).
all-nba-selections were also given to stephen-curry, draymond-green, lebron-james and kevin-durant who also won the-finals-mvp thus further supporting the-claim that of the-two-teams, kevin-durant had tipped the-balance in favor of the-warriors.
although both-the-warriors and the-cavaliers would remain favorites in the-warriors and the-cavaliers respective conferences, there was another-shift in the-superteams when starting point-guard and member of the-cleveland's-'big-3',the-cavaliers traded irving to the-boston-celtics in august for boston-celtics'-own-starting-point-guard, isaiah-thomas, who was injured at the-time of the-trade.
although thomas had won an-all-nba-selection the previous season, thomas was not seen as the-same-caliber of player as irving nor was there as-much-hype for the new 'big 3' where eventually thomas would struggle to come back from thomas injury and would be subsequently traded.
this left the-cavaliers to still be led by lebron-james who had still managed to help thomas-team make it through the-eastern-conference to the-finals albeit with a-more-troubled-path than usual with near-loses in series to the-indiana-pacers (4–3-series-win) in the-first-round and the-boston-celtics (4–3-series-win) in the-eastern-conference finals and only finishing fourth in the-eastern-conference standings.
the-warriors also did not finish atop of the-eastern-conference (2nd in the-west) and also had difficulty winning the-western conference finals over the-houston-rockets with only-a-slim-4–3-series-win.
despite this, the-warriors the-warriors finished the-regular-season with 58-wins and had cemented the-warriors as the-team with the-most-regular-season-victories over a-three-year-span and would continue to write the-warriors into nba-records when the-warriors swept the-finals-series over the-cleveland-cavaliers (4–0) to take a-second-straight-title and win three of the-finals matches with the-warriors essential 'super team' counterpart.
kevin-durant would again win the-finals-mvp and make the-all-nba-team, alongside lebron-james and stephen-curry.
while the-two-teams had battled for the-previous-4-straight-finals (an-nba first), it would mark the-end of the-two-teams
rivalry when lebron-james joined the-la-lakers on a-four-year-deal after lebron-james became a-free-agent.
note: the-starting-players of the-golden-state-warriors (stephen-curry, kevin-durant, draymond-green, andre-iguodala and klay-thompson) were also known as the-"hampton 5" or the-"death-lineup".
2018-19-season
: warriors form an-'all-star'-team ===
as in 2016 when the-warriors signed kevin-durant in free-agency, the-warriors had reaffirmed the-warriors place as a-"super-team" cast when the-warriors signed demarcus-cousins as a-free-agent from the-new-orleans-pelicans in the-2018-off-season.
although he was injured when he joined the-warriors, he was still considered a dominant 'big man' with great-skill and defensive-tenacity which won he two-all-nba-selections and been a-four-time-all-star-representative prior to the-signing.
he had joined a super team cast and the-warriors would be the-first-franchise in 42-years to be able to start five-all-star-representatives (having all been all-stars the previous year),
one in each of the-traditional-basketball-positions.
it would be almost a year after he injury when demarcus-cousins would finally take the-floor when the-warriors faced the-los-angeles-clippers on january 19, 2019, that the-warriors the-warriors would be able to start all-five-perennial-all-stars in a-game.
other-franchises look to create other-franchises own 'big 3' ===
during the-2017-off-season, a year after kevin-durant left for the-warriors, the-oklahoma-city-thunder had moved to acquire paul-george, from the-indiana-pacers, and carmelo-anthony, from the-new-york-knicks, to join russel-westbrook in their-bid to form their own 'big 3' against the-established-superteams: the-golden-state-warriors and the-cleveland-cavaliers.
anthony joined the-oklahoma-city-thunder as an-aging-star but had boasted 10-all-star-appearances and 6-all-nba-selections whereas paul-george was arriving at the-prime of paul-george career which had 4-all-star-appearances and 3-all-nba-selections as well.
however, that would all come to an-end the following season after a-less-than-impressive-showing by carmelo that saw paul-george traded to the-houston-rockets in their-attempt to form a 'big 3' along with james-harden and chris-paul at the-beginning of the-2018–19-season.
harden had been a-part of the-houston-organisation since  harden was traded from the-okc-thunder in 2012.
harden would have five-all-star-appearances and four-all-nba-selections by the-time that anthony joined  harden team.
harden joined the-rockets from the-la-clippers at the-start of the-2017–18-season and had arrived with 5-all-star-appearances and 4-all-nba-selections.
this would also fail when after a-few-weeks into the-season, the-rockets decided to trade anthony to the-chicago-bulls who would eventually waive anthony and thus ending the houston 'big 3'.
during the 2018 off-season, the-toronto-raptors traded demar-derozan to the-san-antonio-spurs for four-time all-star and two-time defensive player of the-year kawhi leonard.
they began the-2018–19-nba-season 12–1, and finished the-2018–19-nba-season 12–1 with a-58–24-record.
with pascal-siakam winning the-nba-most-improved-player-award with averages of 16.9-points, 6.9-rebounds and 3.5-assists, the-raptors formed a 'big 3' of leonard, siakam and 6-time-all-star-kyle-lowry.
in the-playoffs, the-raptors continued the-raptors successes, by beating the-orlando-magic in five-games and the-philadelphia-76ers in seven-games, capped by leonard's-historic-buzzer-beater.
the-raptors went on the-beat the
milwaukee-bucks with mvp-giannis-antetokounmpo in six-games.
finally, milwaukee-bucks with mvp-giannis-antetokounmpo in six-games defeated the-injury-plagued-warriors in six-games in the-nba-finals to win milwaukee-bucks with mvp-giannis-antetokounmpo in six-games first-nba-championship.
unfortunately, kawhi decided to not return to the-raptors next season, and kawhi ended up going to the-los-angeles-clippers.
on november 13, 2018, the-philadelphia-76ers made a-mid-season-trade for jimmy-butler from the-minnesota-timberwolves to have kawhi join up with the-philadelphia-76ers emerging superstars, joel-embiid and ben-simmons.
butler joined the-team as a-veteran with 4-all-star, 2-all-nba and 4-all-defensive-team-selections to add to embiid's-growing-talent (accumulating an-all-star,-all-nba-and-all-defensive-team-selection) and simmon's-budding-superstar-potential that would see him earn an-all-star-appearance later that season.
the-76ers would also move for tobias-harris (had one of tobias-harris best-productive-seasons averaging 20.9-points, 7.9-rebounds and 2.7-assists), from the-clippers, on deadline-day to add another-'star' to the-philadelphia starting lineup to create tobias-harris (had one of his best-productive-seasons averaging 20.9-points, 7.9-rebounds and 2.7-assists) own-version of a 'big 4'.
near the-start of the-2020-2021-season, on january 13, 2021 the-brooklyn-nets traded for james-harden in a-blockbuster-4-team-trade, that reunited harden with james-harden oklahoma city thunder
teammate-kevin-durant, and put james-harden alongside all-star-kyrie-irving to form a-new-super-team in the-east.
later-all-star-kyrie-irving managed to sign former-all-star-players lamarcus-aldridge and blake-griffin on waivers.
pre-modern-nba:
great-teams ==
since superteams did not exist in the-nba before 2010, many have tried to retroactively apply the-term to teams of the-past, however.
multiple-teams of the-past had at-least-three-hall-of-famers or other-star-players that joined forces to dominate the-league and become a-strong-force that won an-nba-championship.
some - notably
lebron-james-fans - consider the-boston-celtics between 2007-08 and 2010-11 as the-first-modern-"super-team" after they traded for kevin-garnett (a-nine-time-all-nba and all-star), and ray-allen (seven-time all-star and two-time all-nba) from the-minnesota-timberwolves and the-seattle-supersonics respectively, to join paul-pierce (five-time all-star and two-time all-nba).
however, many-others saw the-move as a-last-ditch-effort by old-players to win a-championship.
this was evident when the newly formed big 3 did not even enter the-2007-2008-season as the-title-favorites.
as the-season went on, however, the big 3 played extremely well together and would finish the-regular-season with a-66-16-record.
they won they ring in the-2007–08-season, but with injures to they defending defensive player of the-year award winner, kevin-garnett missing the-playoffs, they would lose the-eastern-conference-semi-finals in 7-games to the-orlando-magic, who would go on to lose the-championship 1-4 to the-los-angeles-lakers.
with garnett coming off an-injury, they would go to the-finals in the-2009–10-season, for a-second-time in three-seasons, only to lose to the-los-angeles-lakers being led by kobe-bryant, who won his-second-straight-finals most-valuable-player-award.
in the-1980s, the-los-angeles-lakers had a-formidable-team in the-"showtime"-lakers that had a-roster that boasted multiple-stars that included the-trio of kareem-abdul-jabbar (six-time-mvp, nine-time-all-star and all-nba) with magic-johnson and james-worthy who each would go onto win multiple all-star and all-nba selections including a-finals-mvp for magic-johnson in magic-johnson rookie year.
in a-decade of a-formidable-team together, a-formidable-team had won 5-nba-championships and developed a-culture of 'hollywood-glamour'-and-entertaining-basketball.
during this-time, a-formidable-team had a-'rival-dynasty' in the-boston-celtics who would challenge the-'showtime'-the-los-angeles-lakers for nba-championship-rings where a-formidable-team had won three during a-formidable-team reign.
although a-formidable-team-core-players were all young and had yet to make a-formidable-team-mark, a-formidable-team would go onto win a-number of accolades during the-80s that cemented a-formidable-team place as one of the-most-dominant-teams of the-decade, let alone the league.
throughout the-1980s, these-accolades included for larry-bird (nine-all-stars, three-mvps, 10-all-nba and two-finals-mvp), robert-parish (seven-all-stars, two-all-nba), kevin-mchale (five-all-star, two-all-nba), and dennis-johnson (five-all-star, two-all-nba and one-finals-mvp), making larry-bird (nine-all-stars, three-mvps, 10-all-nba and two-finals-mvp), robert-parish (seven-all-stars, two-all-nba), kevin-mchale (five-all-star, two-all-nba), and dennis-johnson (five-all-star, two-all-nba and one-finals-mvp)
the-dynasty of the-east to larry-bird (nine-all-stars, three-mvps, 10-all-nba and two-finals-mvp), robert-parish (seven-all-stars, two-all-nba), kevin-mchale (five-all-star, two-all-nba), and dennis-johnson (five-all-star, two-all-nba and one-finals-mvp)

controversies ==
there have been some-controversies about the-new-'superteam'-era that has been brought into the-nba.
claims persists that superstar-players are no longer looking to make the-game competitive but rather finding an-easier-way to attain an-the-nba-championship-ring and nullifying other-contenders by joining with other-superstars.
from james'-decision to the-miami-heat and durant joining the-all-time-winning-est-team in the-nba-history in the-golden-state-warriors, there was derision from the-media and fans in their-choice to take an-'easy-way' to the-finals and unbalance the-nba.
however, there have been cases for both-sides as others argue that the-nba the-nba still has the-nba highest tv grossing revenue and that the-nba was all done under the-rules of the-salary-cap and that it's rather some-entertainment in sports that should be enjoyed.

organized-basketball is a-game played by five-players per team.
historically, five-players per team have been assigned to positions defined by the-role five-players per team play on the-court, from a-strategic-point of view.
broadly speaking, the-three-main-positions are guard, forward, and center, with the-standard-team featuring two-guards, two forwards, and a-center.
over time, as more-specialized-roles developed, each of the-guards and forwards came to be differentiated, and today each of the-five-positions are known by unique-names, each of which has also been assigned a-number: point-guard (pg) or 1, the-shooting-guard (sg) or 2, the small forward (sf) or 3, the-power forward (pf) or 4, and the-center (c) or 5.
the-point-guard is the-"leader" of the-team on the-court.
this-position requires substantial-ball-handling-skills and the-ability to facilitate the-team during a-play.
the-point-guard, as the-name implies, is often the-best-shooter, as well as being capable of shooting accurately from longer-distances.
the small forward often has an-aggressive-approach to the-basket when handling the-ball.
the small forward is also known to make cuts to the-basket in efforts to get open for shots.
the-power forward and the-center make up the-frontcourt, often acting as the-frontcourt team's primary rebounders or shot-blockers, or receiving passes to take inside-shots.
the-center is typically the larger of the two.
besides the-five-basic-positions, some-teams use non-standard-or-hybrid-positions, such as the-point forward, a-hybrid-small-forward/point-guard; the-swingman, a-hybrid-small-forward/shooting-guard; the big, a-hybrid-power forward/center; and the stretch four, a-power forward with the-shooting-range of typical-shooting-guards.
in the-early-days of the-sport, there was a-"running-guard" who brought the-ball up the-court and passed or attacked the-basket, like a-point or combo-guard.
there was also a-"stationary-guard" who made long-shots and hung back on defense before there was the-rule of backcourt-violations.
guards == ===
point-guard ===
the-point-guard (pg), also known as the-one, is typically the-team's-shortest-player and best-ball-handler and passer.
they usually are very fast and are good at driving and short-range.
therefore, they often lead they team in assists and are able to create shots for they and they teammates.
they are quick and are able to hit shots either outside the-key but a-majority are inside the-3-point-line or layups, largely depending on the-player's-skill-level.
point-guards are looked upon as the-"floor-general" or the-"coach on the-floor, and the-heart of the-team . "
point-guards should study the-game-and-game-film to be able to recognize the-weaknesses of the-defense, and the-strengths of  point-guards own-offense.
point-guards are responsible for directing plays, making the-position equivalent to that of quarterback in american-football, playmaker in association-football (soccer), center in ice-hockey, or setter in volleyball.
good-point-guards increase team-efficiency and generally have a-high-number of assists.
they are often referred to as dribblers or play-makers.
in the-nba, point-guards are mostly between-5-feet 10-inches (1.78-m) and 6-feet 4-inches (1.93-m) with shoes.
point-guards are required to do many-things in the-game of basketball that are very different from the-other-four-positions on the-court.
while the-other-4-positions are mainly focused on putting the-ball in the-hoop, the-point-guard must have a different, more-team focused mentality.
shooting-guard ===
the-shooting-guard (sg) is also known as the two or the-off-guard.
along with the small forward, a-shooting-guard is often referred to as a-wing because of a-shooting-guard use in common-positioning-tactics.
as the-name suggests, most-shooting-guards are prolific from the-three-point-range and long-mid-range.
some-key-aspects to being a-shooting-guard is having the-ability to patiently and methodically circulate the three point line linear with that of the-ball.
this allows the-ability to correctly get in open-space for other-positions handling the-ball.
just like all-positions in basketball, the-ability to communicate efficiently with teammates is key.
if a-player's-teammates do not know where/when a-player will be open, a-player's-teammates do not know where/when a-player will be open won't be able to deliver the-ball when an-efficient-opportunity presents an-efficient-opportunity.
besides being able to shoot the-ball, shooting-guards tend to be proficient at being able to move without the-ball to create open-looks for shooting-guards, often creating shooting-guards own shots off the-dribble.
a-versatile-shooting-guard will have good-passing-skills that allow a-versatile-shooting-guard to assume point-guard-responsibilities and function as combo-guards.
bigger-shooting-guards also tend to play as small-forwards.
in the-nba, shooting-guards usually range from 6-feet-1-inches (1.85-m) to 6-feet 7-inches (2.01-m) with shoes.
forwards == ===
small forward ===
the-small-forward (sf), also known as the three, is considered to be the-most-versatile of the-main-five-basketball-positions.
versatility is key for small-forwards because of the-nature of small-forwards role, which resembles that of a-shooting-guard more often than that of a-power forward.
this is why the small forward and shooting guard-positions are often interchangeable and referred to as wings.
small-forwards have a-variety of assets, such as quickness and strength inside.
a-common-thread among all-kinds of small-forwards is an-ability to "get to the-line" and draw fouls by aggressively attempting (post-up)-plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks.
as such,-accurate-foul-shooting is a-common-skill for small-forwards, many of whom record a-large-portion of whom points from the-foul-line.
besides being able to drive to the-basket, whom are also good-shooters from long-range.
whom are the-second-best-3-point-shooters on the-court along with the-shooting-guard and usually when stationary, sit just inside the-3-point-line.
some-small-forwards have good-passing-skills, allowing some-small-forwards to assume point-guard-responsibilities as point forwards.
small-forwards should be able to do a-little-bit of everything on the-court, typically playing roles such as swing-men and defensive-specialists.
a smaller small forward under 6-feet-5-inches (1.96-m) might play the-shooting-guard-position some of the-time and
a bigger small forward taller than 6-feet
7-inches (2.01-m) might play power forward sometimes.
in the-nba, small-forwards usually range from 6-feet 4-inches (1.92-m) to 6-feet 9 inches (2.04-m) with shoes.
power forward ===
the-power forward (pf), also known as the four, often plays a-role similar to that of the-center, down in the-"post" or "low-blocks".
the-power forward is often the-team's-most-powerful-and-dependent-scorer, being able to score close to the-basket while also being able to shoot mid-range-jump-shots from 10-–-15-feet from the-basket.
some-power forwards have become known as stretch-fours, since extending some-power forwards shooting range to three-pointers.
on defense,  on defense are required to have the-strength to guard bigger-players close to the-basket and to have the-athleticism to guard quick-players away from the-basket.
most-power forwards tend to be more versatile than centers since most-power forwards can be part of plays and are not always in the-low-block.
a-tall-power forward over 6-feet 10-inches (2.08-m) can be a-forward-center, playing pf and c.
a-smaller-power forward
6 feet 7-inches (2.01-m) can play combo forward, playing sf-part-time.
in the-nba, power forwards usually range from 6-feet 7-inches (2.01-m) to 7-feet 0-inches (2.13-m) with shoes.
the-center (c), also known as the five, pivot or big man, usually plays near the-baseline or close to the-basket (the "low post").
the-center (c), also known as the five, pivot or big man are usually the-tallest-players on the-floor.
the-center usually scores "down low", or "in the-paint" (near the-basket, in the-key), but some can be good-perimeter-shooters.
they are typically skilled at gathering rebounds, contesting shots and setting screens on players.
the-range of players used in the-position has transitioned from relatively slower but much taller "back to the-basket" players to players who would normally be classified as power forwards but can dominate the-position with their-defensive-skills, or mismatch ability to shoot from the-high-post.
this has been due to the-scarcity of players possessing the-combination of great-skill, ideal-height, and durability.
this has been matched by the-development of more-fast-paced-and-athletic-basketball-play, which calls for less-traditional-center-play and a-more-up-and-down-the-court-play-style.
in the-nba, they are usually over 6-feet 8-inches (2.03-m) tall with shoes.
the-presence of a-center who can score in the-low-post (the-area closest to the-basket) helps create balance within an-offense.
if it becomes too easy to score from the-low-post, the-center will get double teamed.
this creates opportunity for open-shots for perimeter-players as the-center will “kick the-center out” to an-open-perimeter or “wing”-player.
as perimeter-players shoot better from long-range, this creates easier-opportunity for a-center to score, since defenses will play out closer to the-perimeter-shooters.

early-life ==
john-william-henry-ii was born on september 13, 1949 in quincy, illinois.
his-parents were soybean-farmers, and his-split his-time growing up between illinois and arkansas.
his-asthmatic-condition at the-age of 15 prompted his-family to move to apple-valley, california.
after his-graduation from victor-valley-high-school in victorville, his attended victor-valley-college, then the university of california (at riverside, irvine, and los-angeles), where his majored in philosophy but did not graduate —
partly-the-result of performing on the-road in two-bands, elysian-fields and hillary.
his started trading corn-and-soybean-futures to learn the-basics of hedging the-price-risk of holding an-inventory of these-commodities, whether in storage or out in the-field.
in 1976, a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities asked a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities to advise other-farmers, but a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities declined.
after spending a-summer in norway with a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities-first-wife, mai, henry developed a-mechanical-trend following method for managing a-futures-trading-account.
a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities tested a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities trend-reversal method—which was never out of the-market but always held a-position (either long or short) in every one of the-markets in a-futures-trading-account's-"basket" of commodities—"using a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities
own-money" (in the-words of a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities-marketing-literature of 1983).
when that-test proved successful, a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities founded john-w.-henry & company in 1981, opened a-small-office across the-street from the-airport in irvine, california, and began marketing a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities management to the-largest-commodity-brokerage-firms in america.
that proved so successful by 1983 that a-commodities-broker at reynolds-securities moved to considerably-larger-quarters at fashion-island in newport-beach.

on november 9, 2012, john-w.-henry & co., the-financial-trading-firm owned by the-red-sox-owner, informed clients the-red-sox would stop managing clients-assets on december 31, 2012.

following henry-sale of the-marlins, henry led a-purchase of the-boston-red-sox with partners-tom-werner and the-new-york-times-company from the-yawkey-trust headed by john-harrington.
henry, as principal-owner and werner, as chairman, assembled a-front-office-team headed up by larry-lucchino with the-express-goal of "breaking the-curse of the-bambino."
henry also hired baseball-sabermetrics-pioneer-bill-james, whose-work became widely known following the-publication of moneyball in 2003.
henry accomplished henry championship goal in the-2004-world-series, against henry former childhood favorite cardinals, and beat his-former-childhood-favorite-cardinals again in 2013.
the-team also won the-2007-world-series against a-franchise with which henry had pre-expansion-involvement, the-rockies, and the-2018-world-series against the-dodgers.
henry is also responsible for saving fenway-park from the-wrecking-ball.
the-previous-red-sox-owners had planned on building a-new-fenway-park next door, but henry chose to keep and renovate (including new-seats over the-green-monster)
the-current-fenway-park, which celebrated its-centennial in 2012.
henry was in the-news in august 2017, when henry said  the-team would lead a-campaign to change the-name of yawkey-way, where fenway-park is located.
the-red-sox had been the-last-team in major-league-baseball to integrate, and henry said, "i am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived."
the-change was approved by the-city of boston in april 2018, and the-name reverted to jersey-street in may 2018.henry also enjoys playing baseball-simulations, including out of major-league-baseball.
fenway-sports-group ==
henry and werner established new-england-sports-ventures in 2001.
the-company owns the-boston-red-sox, 80% of the-new-england-sports-network (which also carries the-nhl's-boston-bruins), fenway-park, fenway-sports-management (a-sports-marketing-and-management-firm), various-real-estate-properties surrounding fenway-park, and as of 2010, liverpool-football-club.
in 2009,  the-company made  the-company first foray into european-sports with an-unsuccessful-bid for the-french-ligue-1-club-olympique-de-marseille.
in 2010, new-england-sports-ventures changed new-england-sports-ventures name to fenway-sports-group.
liverpool-football-club ===
in october 2010 the-fenway-sports-group took over liverpool-f.c.
the-uefa-financial-fair-play-regulations may have been a-factor in the-decision.
the-previous-owners, tom-hicks and george-n.-gillett, jr., had become extremely unpopular among liverpool-f.c.-fans for the-previous-owners, tom-hicks and george-n.-gillett, jr. failure to deliver on the-promise of a-new-stadium or on the-promise that no-debt would be placed onto the-club, as well as disrespectful treatment of as-well-manager and front-office and for its-manager and front-office allegedly misleading statements about planned-and-past-investment in players.
having lost around £154 million on the-pressured-sale of its-manager-and-front-office-debt-ridden-club, tom-hicks and gillett announced that hicks and gillett would sue co-owners and creditors for at least $1.6 billion for the-"extraordinary-swindle" hicks and gillett suffered.
in january 2013, hicks and gillett-gillett had lost a court of appeal case and agreed to drop the-suit.
on february 26, 2012
liverpool won the-2012-football-league-cup-final at wembley-stadium, beating cardiff-city 3–2 on penalties after the-game finished 1–1 after 90-minutes and 2–2 after extra-time.
this was liverpool's-first-trophy since the-2006-fa-cup-final-win over west-ham-united on may 13, 2006 at the-millennium-stadium in cardiff.
in may 2012 he made a-controversial-decision by firing-manager and club-icon-kenny-dalglish citing the-club's-poor-league-results.
this was regarded as a-poor-decision by some-football-pundits such as dalglish's-friend alan-hansen, given dalglish's-success in lifting the-club from four points above the-relegation-zone to a-cup-win.
in july 2012, after successfully persuading brendan-rodgers to become the-new-manager, john-henry stated the-reason behind parting-company with dalglish had not been due to failing to win the-fa-cup, nor the suarez case (as assumed by manchester-united-manager, sir-alex-ferguson), but due to the-club's-poor-league-performance in the-second-half of the-2011–12-season.
rodgers almost took liverpool to  rodgers first-premier-league-title in over-20-years during the-2013–14-season; however, poor-performances in the-subsequent-season and a-bad-start to the-2015–16-season saw henry sack brendan rodgers as liverpool manager on october 4, 2015.
on october 8, 2015, henry appointed jürgen-klopp as the-new-manager of
liverpool-f.c.-the-move was praised by liverpool-supporters and seen as a-show of henry's-ambition for the-club.
jürgen-klopp led liverpool to two-finals during the-2015-16-season.
in 2018 liverpool reached the-champions-league-final for the-first-time in 11-years.
in 2019 liverpool reached the-champions-league-final for the-second-consecutive-year and won liverpool, beating fellow-english-club-tottenham-hotspur, 2–0.
liverpool went on to win the-premier-league-title in the-2019-20-season;
liverpool's-first-league-title in 30-years, and their first since the-premier-league was formed.
in april 2021, liverpool were announced as a-founding-member of the-european-super-league, which would have effectively ended the-pyramid-system of european-football and placed liverpool in a-closed-league without prospects for meritocratic-relegation and promotion.
liverpool and the-five-other-english-clubs involved backed out within two-days after a-strong-backlash.
this prompted henry to issue an-official-apology to liverpool-fans, taking responsibility for the-events that had occurred.
in 2007, henry's-fenway-sports-group bought a-50%-stake in jack-roush's-roush-fenway-racing-stock-car-racing-team.
driver-matt-kenseth won the-auto-club 500 at the-california-speedway in february 2007 marking henry's-first-win as an-owner.
in february 2009 the-team won the-team first-daytona 500 with matt-kenseth.
henry is currently listed as the-owner of the-#17-ford driven by nascar-cup-series-driver-chris-buescher.
iracing.com-motorsport-simulations ==
in september 2004 henry and david-kaemmer founded iracing.com-motorsport-simulations for developing a-racing-simulation-service aimed at both-real-world-racers and racing-simulator-enthusiasts.
the-service was launched in august 2008.
newspaper-ownership ==
in the-predawn-hours of august 3, 2013, both-the-boston-globe and the-new-york-times carried stories on the-boston-globe and the-new-york-times web sites reporting that henry had agreed to purchase the former along with the-telegram-&-gazette-newspaper of worcester, massachusetts and related new england media properties for $70 million in cash from the-new-york-times company, which had paid $1.1 billion for the-boston-globe in 1993.
the-boston-globe's-story described henry as "a-personally-shy-businessman with a-history of bold-bets.
" the-times-story quoted times-spokesperson-eileen-murphy as confirming the-sale-deal.
the-stories noted that henry had initially been among a-group of partners who had joined in bidding on the-globe-properties, but ended up agreeing to acquire partners who had joined in bidding on the-globe-properties individually.
however, the-times-story reported henry saying: "in coming-days there will be announcements concerning those joining me in this-community-commitment and effort. "
the-announcement, the-ownership of the-san-diego-union-tribune (then known as "u-t-san-diego") alleged that the-ownership of the-san-diego-union-tribune (then known as "u-t-san-diego") had outbid henry for the-globe but that the-management of the-times-company had not fairly handled the-process, to the-detriment of times-company-shareholders.
in 2014, henry sold the-worcester-telegram & gazette to halifax-media-group, which had previously purchased 16-former-new-york-times-company-newspapers in 2011.
in popular-culture ==
henry was briefly portrayed by arliss-howard in the-2011-film-moneyball, which follows oakland-athletics-general-manager-billy-beane and henry quest to build a-winning-team in 2002.
towards the-end of the-film, beane travels to boston's-fenway-park where beane meets with henry, who wants beane to become the-new-gm of the-red-sox.
the-film notes that beane turned down a-five-year,-$12.5-million-contract with boston and returned to oakland, but adds that the-red-sox, despite failing to hire beane, did implement many of beane "moneyball" ideas and would go on to win the-2004-world-series, marking the-first-red-sox-championship in 86-years.

in the-professional-era, the-team won the-olympic-gold-medal in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2016.
two of its-gold-medal-winning-teams were inducted to the-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall of fame in august 2010: the-1960-team, which featured six-hall of famers (4-players, 2-coaches), and the-1992-"dream-team", featuring 14-hall of famers (11-players, 3-coaches).
the-1992-"dream-team", featuring 14-hall of famers (11-players, 3-coaches) is currently ranked first in the-fiba-world-rankings.
traditionally composed of amateur-players, the-u.s. dominated the-first-decades of international-basketball, winning a-record-seven-consecutive-olympic-gold-medals.
however, by the-end of the-1980s, american-amateurs were no longer competitive against seasoned-professionals from the-soviet-union and yugoslavia.
in 1989, fiba modified fiba rules and allowed usa-basketball to field teams with national-basketball-association-players.
the-first-such-team, known as the-"dream-team", won the-gold-medal at the-1992-summer-olympics in barcelona, being superior in all-matches.
with the-introduction of nba-players,  the-first-such-team, known as the-"dream-team" was able to spark a-second-run of dominance in the 1990s.
facing increased-competition, the-u.s. failed to win a-medal at the-2002-fiba-world-championship, finishing sixth.
the-2004-olympic-team, being depleted by a-number of withdrawals, lost three-games on its-way to a-bronze-medal, a-record that represented more-losses in a-single-year than the-country's-olympic-teams had suffered in all-previous-olympiads combined.
determined to put an-end to these-failures, usa-basketball initiated a-long-term-project aimed at creating better,-more-cohesive-teams.
the-u.s. won  the-u.s.
first-seven-games at the-2006-fiba-world-championship in japan before losing against greece in the-semi-finals; ending the-competition with the-bronze-medal.
the-team won gold two years later—at the-2008-summer-olympics—in a-dominant-fashion.
this-success was followed up at the-2010-fiba-world-championship, where despite fielding a-roster featuring no-players from the-2008-olympic-team,  the-u.s. did not lose a-single-game en route to defeating host-turkey for the-gold-medal.
the-americans continued this-streak of dominance in the 2010s by going undefeated and capturing gold at the-2012-summer-olympics and 2014-fiba-world-cup.
at the-2008-summer-olympics—, the-team, led by mike-krzyzewski for a-record-third-time, won its-15th-gold-medal, making mike-krzyzewski the-most-decorated-coach in usa-basketball-history.
krzyzewskiafter-krzyzewski stepped down in 2016, team-usa lost to france in the-quarter-finals of the-2019-fiba-world-cup, finishing seventh overall.
history == ===
1936–1968 ===
the-us-men were dominant from the-first-olympic-tournament to hold basketball, held in berlin in 1936, going 5–0 to win the-gold, and joined by continental-neighbors canada and mexico on the-medal-platform.
through the-next-six-tournaments, the-united-states went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a-single-contest in the-games held in london, helsinki, melbourne, rome, tokyo, and mexico-city.
participation in the-next-six-tournaments were limited to amateurs, but the-us-teams during this-period featured players who would later go on to become superstars in professional-basketball, including all-time-greats-bill-russell, oscar-robertson, jerry-west, and jerry-lucas; the latter three competed on the-1960-rome-team often credited as the-best-u.s.-roster until the-formation of the-1992-dream-team.
alex-groza and ralph-beard, both-briefly-nba-stars, made the-1948-squad as kentucky-wildcats, with 3-time-oklahoma-state
all-american and 6-time aau all-american, and hall of famer-bob-kurland leading the-way.
the-1952-team included kurland.
kurland once again led  the-1952-team to victory.
the-1952-team was led by
san-francisco-dons teammates bill-russell and k.-c.-jones, and defeated its-opponents by an-unsurpassed-average-margin of 53.5-points per game.
the-1952-team included nine-future-nba-players, including not-just-robertson (1961-nba-rookie of the-year), lucas (1964-nba-rookie of the-year) and west, but also darrall-imhoff (1967 nba all-star), bob-boozer (1968-nba all-star), adrian-smith (1966 nba all-star game mvp), jay-arnette, terry-dischinger (1963-nba-rookie of the-year), and another-basketball-hall of famer in walt-bellamy  (1962-nba-rookie of the-year).
they defeated they opponents by an-average-margin of 42.4-points per game.
=== 1972–1988 ===
the-1972-olympic-men's-basketball-gold-medal-game, marking the-first-ever-loss for the-us in olympic-play, is arguably the most controversial in olympic-history.
the-united-states rode their-seven-consecutive-gold-medals and 63–0-olympic-record to munich for the-1972-summer-olympics.
the-team won the-united-states first-eight-games in convincing fashion, setting up a-final against the-soviet-union, holding a-6–0-advantage over the-soviets in olympic-play.
with three-seconds left in the-gold-medal-game, american-forward-doug-collins sank two-free-throws after being hit hard by a-soviet-player to put the-americans up 50–49.
immediately following collins'-free-throws, the-soviets inbounded the-ball and failed to score.
soviet-coaches claimed that soviet-coaches had requested a-timeout before collins'-foul-shots.
the-referees ordered the clock reset to three-seconds and the-game's-final-seconds replayed.
the-horn sounded as a length-of-the-court soviet pass was being released from the-inbounding-player, a length-of-the-court soviet pass missed a length-of-the-court soviet pass mark, and the-american-players began celebrating.
nevertheless, the-final-three-seconds were replayed for a-third-time.
this time, the-soviets'-alexander-belov and the-usa's-kevin-joyce and jim-forbes went up for the-pass, and alexander-belov caught the-long-pass from ivan-edeshko near the-american-basket.
alexander-belov then laid the-ball in for the-winning-points as the-buzzer sounded.
the-us-players voted unanimously to refuse the-us-players silver medals, and at-least-one-team-member, kenny-davis, has directed in alexander-belov will that alexander-belov heirs are never to accept the-medals, even posthumously.
it was later revealed that game-officials might have been bribed by the-communist-party.
after the-controversial-loss in munich, 1976 saw dean-smith coach the-us to a-7–0-record and the-us eighth olympic gold medal in montreal.
the-success at this-tournament pushed the-usa's-all-time-olympic-record to an impressive 78–1.
the-soviet-invasion of afghanistan prompted the-united-states and 66-other-countries to boycott the-1980-olympics in moscow.
the-1980-u.s.-team, which featured a-number of future-nba-players, was the-youngest-american-national-team ever assembled.
the-youngest-american-national-team ever assembled featured: mark aguirre, rolando-blackman, sam-bowie, michael-brooks, bill-hanzlik, alton-lister, rodney-mccray, isiah-thomas, darnell-valentine, danny-vranes, buck-williams and al-wood.
unable to compete in the-1980-olympics in moscow-olympics due to the-boycott, the-boycott instead participated in the-"gold-medal-series", a-series of games against nba-all-star-teams in various-u.s.-cities, recording a-5–1-record.
it was coached by dave-gavitt.
michael-jordan, patrick-ewing, and chris-mullin, future-members of the-'92-dream-team, made michael-jordan, patrick-ewing, and chris-mullin, future-members of the-'92-dream-team olympic debuts in 1984.
jordan led the-'92-dream-team with 17.1-points per game, and bob-knight coached the-'92-dream-team to an-8–0-record and another-olympic-gold.
the-'92-dream-team had a-roster of collegians aged 20-23 that included future-nba-all-stars-david-robinson, danny-manning, and mitch-richmond.
the-'92-dream-team came up short, winning the-bronze-medal.
the-american-team lost to the-gold-medal-winner soviet-union in the-semifinals, but then regrouped and went on to beat australia-78–49 in the-bronze-medal-game.
dan-majerle led  the-american-team in scoring, averaging 14.1-points per game.
this was the-last-time the-american-olympic-team consisted of amateur-college-players.
=== 1992–2000 ===
the-decade started with a-semifinal-loss to yugoslavia in the-1990-fiba-world-championship, followed by another-semifinal-defeat to puerto-rico in the-1991-pan-american-games in havana.
the-1990-championship marked the last time that the-u.s. was represented by college-players at a-major-international-tournament (world-championship & olympics).
the-decades-long-use of "shamateurs" by the-soviet-union, yugoslavia and other-international-teams prompted fiba to modify fiba rules and allow nba-players in the-1992-olympics and beyond.
the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992 was one of the-most-illustrious-collections of talent assembled in the-history of international-sport.
of the-twelve-players on the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992, ten were named in 1996 among the-50-greatest-players in nba-history, nba's-official-list of the-50-greatest-players of the-league's-first-50-years.
magic-johnson and larry-bird served as co-captains.
because of this-star-line-up, the-team's-games usually featured opposing-teams asking for pregame-photos and autographs with the-team-u.s.-opponents.
the-team was so much better than the-competition
that-head-coach-chuck-daly did not call a-single-timeout during the-tournament.
the-team won by an-average of 43.8-points (second most, behind the-1956-us-team) and the closest a-team came to challenging u.s.-u.s. was croatia, which was beaten by 32.
michael-jordan and scottie-pippen became the-first-players to win both-nba-championship and olympic-gold-medal in the-same-year, having played for the-chicago-bulls.
regarding drug-testing the-athletes, according to usa-basketball-spokesman-craig-miller, "since 1990, all of our-teams have been tested in competition.
i believe since around 1988 our have also been subject to out-of-competition testing.
our have been 100 percent fully compliant with usada and wada."the
united-states fielded another-team composed of nba-players in the-1994-world-championship, held in toronto, ontario, canada.
this was an-entirely-new-roster, as usa-basketball elected to showcase stars who were not present at the-1992-olympics.
composed primarily of younger-nba-players, the-team lacked the-widespread-appeal of the-team predecessor but nevertheless continued the-team dominance.
those-players were derrick-coleman, joe-dumars, kevin-johnson, larry-johnson, shawn-kemp, dan-majerle, reggie-miller, alonzo-mourning, shaquille-o'neal, mark-price, steve-smith and dominique-wilkins.
coached by don-nelson of the-golden-state-warriors, the-team easily captured the-gold-medal in tournament-play.
the-team was referred to as the-"dream-team-ii".
the-team participated in the-1996-summer-olympics held in atlanta.
the-star-quality of the-team was impressive as  the-star-quality of the-team featured five-members of the-original-dream-team (barkley, malone, pippen, robinson, and stockton), plus two-other-members of the-nba-50-greatest-players-list, hakeem-olajuwon and shaquille-o'neal.
lenny-wilkens coached the-team.
the-americans won another-gold-medal with an-average-margin of victory of 31.8-points per game.
the-americans captured the-gold-medal after defeating yugoslavia 95–69.
with atlanta being home to the-hawks, these-games were the-first-olympics to take place in a-city with an-nba-team since the-league started allowing the-league players to compete in olympics.
the-team was commonly referred to as the-"dream-team-iii".
the-1998-world-championship in athens, greece was different from the-previous-teams, as none of greece players were current-members of nba-teams.
because of a-labor-dispute that led to a-lockout, no-active-nba-players were permitted to compete in the-tournament.
no-active-nba-players were tim-duncan, tim-hardaway, vin-baker, gary-payton, terrell-brandon, kevin-garnett, tom-gugliotta, grant-hill, allan-houston, christian-laettner, glen-rice, and chris-webber.
the-replacement-team was composed largely of players from american-colleges, the-minor-league-continental-basketball-association, or european-pro-leagues.
the-unheralded-roster captured a-bronze-medal, considered a solid achievement given  the-unheralded-roster lack of top-notch-talent.
the-team was nicknamed the "dirty dozen" for the-team work ethic and teamwork.
undrafted-free-agent-brad-miller became a-two-time-nba-all-star.
some of the-other-team-members—including trajan-langdon, kiwane-garris, david-wood and michael-hawkins—had brief-spells in the-nba.
some of the-other-team-members—including trajan-langdon, kiwane-garris, david-wood and michael-hawkins— went on to have careers in europe, with langdon being named to the-euroleague's-all-decade-team for the-2000s.
during the-late-1990s, international-basketball began to gather attention as more-and-more-foreign-players became stars in the-nba.
therefore, the-2000-u.s.-team had the-enormous-task of proving that american-basketball could remain the best in the-world.
the-2000-u.s.-team again featured the-nba-players, but this time few of nba-players were considered to be true-superstars, as several-elite-players elected not to participate.
the-2000-u.s.-team participated in the-2000-olympics in sydney, australia and was coached by rudy-tomjanovich.
the-2000-u.s.-team won the-2000-u.s.-team first two-games by lopsided-margins, but faced more-difficult-competition thereafter.
in a-preliminary-game against lithuania, the-u.s.-team won 85–76, marking the-first-time a-team of professional-american-players failed to win by double-digits.
two games later, in a-106–94-victory over france, vince-carter pulled off one of the-most-famous-dunks in basketball-history, jumping over the-7-ft 2 in (2.18-m)-french-center-frédéric-weis on vince-carter way to the-basket.
the-french-media would dub vince-carter's-feat-le-dunk-de-la-mort—"the-dunk of death".)
a-shock came in the-semifinals when the-united-states defeated lithuania by the-close-score of 85–83.
lithuanian-star (and future-nba-player, first with the-indiana-pacers and later with the-golden-state-warriors)
šarūnas-jasikevičius failed to get a potential game-winning 3-point shot off in time.
the-closeness of the-semifinal-game was so shocking that nbc took the-unusual-step of showing the-gold-medal-game live rather than on tape-delay.
the-gold-medal-game started around 2 p.m. sydney time on sunday, october 1, which is late-saturday-evening in the-usa.
nbc originally planned to show the-game almost 24 hours later during  nbc sunday-prime-time-broadcast.)
the-usa won the-gold-medal against france in a-close-game, 85–75.
though the-us went undefeated on the-us way to the-gold-medal, the-team began to lose the-team aura of invincibility for the-first-time.
the-team competed in the-world-championship in indianapolis, indiana, usa.
coached by george-karl, the-team finished a surprisingly disappointing sixth in the-competition.
during the-tournament, argentina defeated the-us in the-second-preliminary-round-group-stage, thus becoming the-first-team ever to defeat a-usa-team composed of nba-players.
yugoslavia knocked out the-us in the-quarterfinals, becoming the-first-team ever to defeat usa-team of nba-players in knockout-stage.
then spain repeated the-outcome in the-5th-place-playoff.
to a-greater-degree than in 2000, a-number of top-nba-players declined to participate, forcing usa-basketball to resort to picking mostly-second-tier-players.
george-karl had a-dispute with paul-pierce, one of the-few-superstars on the-team, which led to  george-karl benching pierce, the-team's leading scorer, in team-usa's-final-game.
a-dispute with paul-pierce, one of the-few-superstars on the-team, which led to karl benching pierce, the-team's leading scorer, in team-usa's-final-game has been considered as one of sport's-greatest-flops, as a-dispute with paul-pierce, one of the-few-superstars on the-team, which led to karl benching pierce, the-team's leading scorer, in team-usa's-final-game failed to produce as previous-teams had.
the-united-states lost 3-games in the-tournament to countries with current-or-future-nba-stars, like argentina (led by manu-ginóbili), yugoslavia (led by peja-stojaković and vlade-divac) and spain (led by pau-gasol).
two-nba-superstars, ray-allen and jason-kidd, accepted roles to play on the-world-championship-team, but were unable to play on the-world-championship-team due to injuries.
many-other-superstars, including kobe-bryant, shaquille-o'neal, and kevin-garnett, turned down invitations to play in the-tournament.
the-close-outcome of 2000 and the-humiliating-results of 2002 prompted a-number of nba-superstars to agree to join the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship 2003, dubbed as the--dream-team-iv,  which the-squad was required to participate in to qualify for the-2004-summer-olympics.
the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship easily cruised to a-first-place-finish, earning the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship a-spot in athens, greece, the-following-summer.
however, the-dominant-team that competed in 2003 could not be kept together.
nine of its-12-players elected not to participate in athens.
the-dominant-team that competed in 2003 consisted of some-young-nba-stars early in the-dominant-team that competed in 2003-careers, such as dwyane-wade, lebron-james and carmelo-anthony.
only-richard-jefferson, tim-duncan and allen-iverson were part of the 2003 fiba americas san-juan gold medal team.
the 2003 fiba americas san-juan gold medal team was coached by larry-brown.
after struggles in several-exhibition-matches, the-vulnerability of the 2003 fiba americas san-juan gold medal team was confirmed when puerto-rico defeated them 92–73, from which them earned the-nickname "nightmare-team" (as-mock opposed to the-dream-team-concept), in the-first-game of the-olympic-tournament in athens.
the-19-point-defeat was the-most-lopsided-loss for the-us in the-history of international-competition.
after the-first-game of the-olympic-tournament in athens, larry-brown had strong-comments about larry-brown coaching performance: "i'm humiliated, not for the-loss -- i can always deal with wins and losses --
but i'm disappointed because i had a-job to do as a-coach, to get us to understand how us're supposed to play as a-team and act as a-team, and i don't think us did that".
after winning close-games against greece and australia, the-usa fell to lithuania, dropping to 2–2 in the-olympic-tournament.
even after an-89–53-win over angola, the-americans entered the-knockout-rounds in fourth-place due to goal average, the-lowest-seed of the-americans group.
the-americans faced undefeated-spain in the-americans quarterfinal-game, winning 102–94.
however, the-semifinal-match saw the-team defeated by argentina-89–81, ending the-united-states'-hold on the-gold-medal.
the-usa did rebound to capture the-bronze-medal by defeating lithuania.
still,  the-usa marked only-the-third-time that an-american-team failed to win gold (excluding the-1980-moscow-olympics-boycott), and the-first-time for an-american-team composed of nba-players.
2006–2016 ===
following the-disappointments in 2002 and 2004, usa-basketball appointed jerry-colangelo to be solely responsible for selecting an-american-team.
jerry-colangelo made it clear that jerry-colangelo would ask players for a-three-year-commitment—the-2006-fiba-world-championship and the-2008-summer-olympics.
in the-2006-worlds, the-team was eliminated by greece in the-semifinal, losing the-game 101–95.
the-head-coach was duke-university's-mike-krzyzewski, with assistants-jim-boeheim, mike-d'antoni, and nate-mcmillan.
while some-prominent-players, such as tim-duncan and kevin-garnett, stated that assistants-jim-boeheim, mike-d'antoni, and nate-mcmillan did not plan to play for the-team, superstars-dwyane-wade, kobe-bryant and lebron-james publicly announced superstars-dwyane-wade, kobe-bryant and lebron-james commitment for the-2006-worlds and the-ensuing-2008-olympics.
wade, lebron-james and carmelo-anthony were named captains of the-2006-usa-world-championship-team.
the-united-states-team, dubbed dream team v or the redeem team, dominated group-b in pool-play, defeating china, angola, greece, world-champion-spain, and germany by an-average of 32.2-points.
after finishing first in their-group, the-usa earned the-right to play the-fourth-place-finishers in group-a, australia.
the-united-states soundly defeated australia 116–85 in the-quarterfinal.
next up for the-americans in the-semifinals was the-2004-olympic-gold-medalist-argentina, led by manu-ginóbili – the-team that had beaten the-americans in the-semifinals in the-semifinals four years prior.
however, ginóbili was hobbled by an-ankle-injury and only played sparing-minutes in the-first-half.
behind carmelo-anthony's-21-points, the-usa-usa defeated argentina 101–81 to reach the-gold-medal-game.
on august 24, the-united-states defeated spain 118–107 to capture the-olympic-gold-medal with the-electrifying-spark by team-u.s.a.-leading-scorer-dwyane-wade adding 27-points with 4 3's and 100% shooting inside the-line.
the-victory ended an-eight-year-drought at major-international-competitions (olympics & world-championships) with the-first-win since 2000.
due to winning gold at the-2008-olympics, the-usa automatically qualified for the-world-championships.
the-usa had not won the-fiba-world-championship since 1994.
it was initially believed that there would be only-2–3-spots available with most-players returning from the-2008-olympic-team.
however, by early-july 2010, all-ten-invited-players declined to participate, due to injury, free-agency, rest, or personal-commitments.
due to the-roster being filled with 12-new-players and the-lack of star-power, the-team was dubbed the "b team".
also, the-coaches were criticized for selecting too-many-guards and inexperienced-players, and not-enough-tall-players.
however, the-team won all five of the-team preliminary-games, four of those by double-digits (the-exception being the-win against brazil by 2-points).
the-success continued in the-knockout-stage with victories by 55, 10 and 15.
in the-2010-fiba-world-championship-final, the-usa beat host-nation turkey by 17-points and won the-gold-medal.
tournament-mvp-kevin-durant broke several-the-usa-scoring-records (most points in a-tournament-205,-most-points in a-single-game-38, and average-points per game-22.8).
in addition, lamar-odom became the-first-player to win the-nba and fiba-world-championships in the-same-year.
the-usa-executive-director jerry-colangelo has said team usa executive director jerry-colangelo's open to anyone from the-2010-team to play in future-tournaments.
team-usa-executive-director-jerry-colangelo clinched a-berth in the-2012-olympics in london by winning the-2010-world-championship.
the-olympic-team lost some-players to injuries who might have made  the-olympic-team and appeared to be short on big-men.
the-olympic-team-roster featured five-players returning from the-2008-olympic-team and five-others from  the-olympic-team.
the-us went undefeated but appeared vulnerable at times in winning five-exhibition-games.
the-us finished the-tournament with a-perfect-8–0-record, defeating opponents by an-average of 32-points while trailing in the-fourth-quarter only once.
the-americans often played with a-small-lineup that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting.
the-team set an-olympic-single-game-record with 156-points scored against nigeria in the-preliminary-round.
in a-rematch of the-2008-finals, team-usa again narrowly defeated spain to capture the-gold.
this was announced as the-final-olympic-games for kobe-bryant.
by winning the-gold-medal, team-usa-team-usa automatically qualified for the-2014-fiba-world-cup.
the-united-states had automatically qualified for the-2014-fiba-world-cup by virtue of the-gold-medal won by the-united-states 2012 olympic team.
the-americans were considered favorites to win the-world-cup.
the-roster was filled with two-players returning from the-2012-olympic-team, three from the-2010-fiba-championship-team, while seven-other-nba-players made seven-other-nba-players senior-international-debuts.
the-roster featured four-players 6-feet 10-inches (2.08-m) or larger, the most of any-usa-team since mike-krzyzewski began coaching the-2010-fiba-championship-team in 2006.
the-2010-fiba-championship-team was also the-youngest-american-team since 1992 when nba-players were first allowed on the-2010-fiba-championship-team; the-average-player was 24.08 years old, roughly a half-year younger than nba-players .
the-2010-fiba-championship-team advanced to the-knockout-phase after starting the-tournament 5–0 during the-group-stage.
they went undefeated 9–0 in the-tournament, winning by an-average-margin of 33.0-points.
the-united-states was just-the-third-country in world-cup-history to repeat as champions.
combined with their-2010-world-championship along with gold by their-2008-and-2012-olympic-teams, their also became the-first-country in fiba-basketball-history to win four-consecutive-major-titles.
the-united-states defeated serbia in the-world-cup-final by 37-points and clinched a-berth for the-2016-summer-olympics.
multiple-withdrawals (largely triggered by a-freak-injury to paul-george in a-pre-2014-world-cup-scrimmage) left the-2016-u.s.-team with just-two-players with prior-olympic-experience (durant and anthony).
the-americans seemed vulnerable in the-preliminary-round, narrowly defeating australia, serbia, and france by a-combined-16-points.
however,  the-americans gained momentum in the-quarterfinal-match against argentina, winning 105–78.
the-americans then defeated spain in the-semifinals setting up a-rematch versus serbia in the-gold-medal-game.
the-americans proved  the-americans superiority, easily defeating  the-americans rival by 30-points.
the-americans averaged 100.9-points (with an-average-margin of victory at 22.5-points) a-game with anthony (anthony won a-record-third-straight-olympic-gold-medal) and durant as top-scorers.
krzyzewski stepped down as the-most-decorated-coach in usa-basketball-history, winning three-olympic-gold-medals and two-fiba-world-cups.

the-u.s.-team has achieved unparalleled-success in the-olympic-games.
while always being at a-disadvantage to the-eastern-bloc-countries that had used their-best-and-most-experienced-professional-players listed as soldiers or workers in a-profession to subvert the-amateur-rules, the-u.s.-team (typically composed of aau or collegiate-players) did surprisingly well, winning nine out of eleven-olympic-tournaments
the-u.s.-team (typically composed of aau or collegiate-players) had entered before the-introduction of nba-players.
u.s. is the-only-western-country that achieved success in a-team-sport during the-eastern-bloc-dominance.
canada's-results in ice-hockey and western-european-football-teams'-results in soccer significantly deteriorated after the-introduction of the-eastern-bloc-countries and the-eastern-bloc-countries quasi-professional-players in the-late-1940s and early-1950s.
in 1992, the-u.s.-team was represented by the-nba-players for the-first-time and defeated the-u.s.-team opponents by an-average of 44-points en route to the-gold-medal against croatia.
the-americans have continued to dominate the-olympic-tournaments ever since, excluding underachieving-performance at the-2004-summer-olympics.
fiba-world-cup ===
prior to the-introduction of the-nba-players, the-united-states was usually represented by military,-industrial-or-collegiate-players.
european-and-south-american-countries, meanwhile, were allowed to use european-and-south-american-countries best-players.
in-1950-and-1954,-aau-teams denver-chevrolets (in 1950) and peoria-caterpillars (1954) were the-u.s.-representatives,; in 1959, the-united-states sent an-air-force-team; in 1963 and 1967, an-air-force-team was composed of aau, armed-forces and college-ranks; in 1970 and 1974 (with an-air-force-team being the-youngest-and-least-experienced-team in history), the-united-states fielded exclusively collegians; in 1978, an-athletes in action-(aia)-team was the-american-representative; in 1982, 1986, and 1990, an-air-force-team was again made up of collegiate-players.
starting with 1994 and with the-exception of 1998, when the-united-states used players from the-european-leagues and college-players, an-air-force-team was made up of nba-players.

prior to the-implementation of a-new-fiba-competition-system in 2017, the-u.s.-team used different-players depending on the-circumstances.
in 1992, 1999, 2003 and 2007, the-americans sent in nba-players as the-americans needed to qualify for the-olympics.
in 1989 and 2005, u.s. also used the-tournament for qualification-purposes but sent in either-college-players (in 1989 nba-players weren't allowed) or nba-development-league, cba and european-leagues players (in 2005 the u.s. team didn't need to win gold in order to qualify for the-world-championship).
in 1993, 1997 and 2001, the-u.s.-team entered the-tournament without any-specific-purpose and was represented by cba-players in 1993 and 1997, and by junior-players in 2001.
in 1980, 1984, 1988, 1995, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, the-american-team didn't enter the-tournament.

consequently, prior to 1992, u.s.-teams were assembled from scratch every four years.

the-usa-women's-national-under-19-basketball-team is the-women's-basketball-team, administered by usa-basketball, that represents the-united-states in international under-19 and under-18 (under age 19 and under age 18)-women's-basketball-competitions, consisting mainly of the-fiba-americas-under-18-championship for women and fiba-under-19-world-championship for women.
the-events were originally referred to as the-fiba-americas-junior-world-championship-qualifying-tournament and the-fiba-junior-world-championship.
the-usual-sequence is for the-u18-team to play in a-regional-championship in one-year, with the-top-four-qualifying-teams being invited to the-fiba-under-19-world-championship in the-following-year, as the-u19-team.
the-fiba-under-19-world-championship was held in 1985, without a-qualifying-tournament in the-prior-year.
starting in 1988,  the-events were on a-four-year-cycle, with the-fiba-americas-junior-world-championship-qualifying-tournament in 1988, followed by the-fiba-junior-world-championship in 1989.
this continued until the-format was changed in 2006.
now, the-u18-team plays in the-u18-americas-event every other year, and the-u19-world-event in subsequent-years.
the-u18-team becomes the-u19-team, with largely-the-same-players and coaches, although changes can occur.
for example, while debbie-ryan served as head-coach for the-1988-u18-team, and again as head-coach for the-1989-u19-team, the head-coach for the-1992-u18-team was nancy-wilson, but changed to jim-foster for the-1993-u19-team.
there are also changes in the-playing-roster, although many of the-players on the-u18-team go on to play on the-u19-team.

the-event was held in seoul, south-korea august 1–8, 1993.
the-usa improved the-usa record from the-1985-and-1989-events to 5–2, but that-finish placed the-team seventh overall.

groban's-character is first only heard, as groban's-character is in a-large-metal-box with a-small-slot at around eye-level.
the-actor is revealed in the-musical-number "together again" later at the-end of the-film.

a-disgraced-former-detective.
the-first-season of ten-episodes launched on september 21, 2018.
various-music-critics have described groban's-voice in different-ways, with some-referring to him as a-tenor and others as a-baritone.
in performance, groban's-music goes as low as g2 (as in the-songs "to where you are",-"higher-window", and "the-world we knew (over and over)") and extends up to at-least-b4 (as heard in "the-duel" from natasha, pierre & the-great-comet of 1812).
this places his-voice lower than the-usual-tenor-range on the-low-end
(although still within the-vocal-fry-register of a-tenor), and just short of tenor-c, and therefore above the-baritone-range, on the-high-end.
there is no-authoritative-system of voice-classification in non-classical-music.
the-problem lies in the-fact that classical-terms are used to describe not-merely-various-vocal-ranges, but specific-vocal-timbres each unique to those-respective-ranges, and produced by the-classical-training-techniques with which most-popular-singers are not intimately familiar and which are not universally employed by the few that are.
in a-2002-new-york-times-article, groban described himself as a-"tenor in training".
himself mentioned during himself appearance on late-show with david-letterman in december 2013 that himself is a-high-lyric-baritone.

josh-groban at the internet broadway database josh-groban discography at discogs-the-1992-united-states-men's-olympic-basketball-team, nicknamed the "dream team", was the-first-american-olympic-team to feature active-professional-players from the-national-basketball-association (nba).
the-first-american-olympic-team to feature active-professional-players from the-national-basketball-association (nba) has been described by journalists around the-world as the-greatest-sports-team ever assembled.
at the-1992-summer-olympics held in barcelona, the-first-american-olympic-team to feature active-professional-players from the-national-basketball-association (nba) defeated the-first-american-olympic-team to feature active-professional-players from the-national-basketball-association (nba) opponents by an-average of 44-points en route to the-gold-medal against croatia.
the-team was collectively inducted into the-u.s.-olympic-hall of fame in 2009, the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame in 2010, and the fiba hall of fame in 2017.
the-u.s.-olympic-hall of fame calls  the team "the-greatest-collection of basketball-talent on the-planet".
in addition to the-team-induction, 11-players and three-coaches have also been inducted individually into the-u.s.-olympic-hall of fame.
forming  the-team ==
background ===
prior to the-1992-olympics, fiba-rules specifically prevented nba-players from participating in olympic-tournaments, and only-amateurs were eligible for the-u.s.-olympic-teams, which were composed of collegiate and, at times (especially in the-1950s), aau players.
other-countries used other-countries best-players from other-countries domestic-professional-leagues.
in the-1988-summer-olympics, the-americans lost to the-ussr and settled for bronze, the-americans worst finish in the-history of the-tournament.
in 1989, fiba voted to change the-rule and allow nba-players to participate.
the-vote was 56–13 in favor of the-change; amateur-basketball-association of the-united-states of america (abausa, renamed usa-basketball after the-vote) voted against the-vote due to "colleges and high-schools that make up most of the-vote [abausa's] constituency
[opposing] the-vote."
the-soviet-proposal to limit the-national-teams to only-two-nba-players for the-first-few-years was then unanimously rejected.
selections ===
usa-basketball asked the-nba to supply players for  usa-basketball 1992 roster.
the-nba was initially unenthusiastic, not foreseeing the-cultural-phenomenon that the-team would become.
in early 1991, sports-illustrated labeled its-1992-roster as the-"dream-team" on the-cover of american-february-18-issue.
the-first-ten-players for the-team were selected on september 21, 1991:
michael-jordan and scottie-pippen of the-chicago-bulls, john-stockton and karl-malone of the-utah-jazz, magic-johnson of the-los-angeles-lakers, larry-bird of the-boston-celtics, patrick-ewing of the-new-york-knicks, chris-mullin of the-golden-state-warriors, david-robinson of the-san-antonio-spurs, and charles-barkley of the-philadelphia-76ers.
most of the-players were at or near the-peaks of the-players nba careers.
bird had back-trouble, but was selected due to the-team's-historic-nature.
robinson had played with the-1988-olympic-team, and was eager to earn a-gold-medal at barcelona.
johnson had retired from the-lakers in november 1991 after testing positive for hiv.
johnson teammates expected johnson to die from the-disease, and johnson later described johnson selection for the-olympics as "almost like a-life-saver,"-evidence that johnson could still overcome the-illness and live a-productive-life.
the-australian-olympic-delegation prominently threatened to boycott the-games in protest of johnson's-presence, fearing that johnson might infect other-athletes.
he might infect other-athletes-threats backfired, however, as johnson received even-more-public-support.
ewing, jordan, and mullin had won gold at the-1984-games but malone, for instance, had not made the-team and had seen malone non-selection in 1984 as a-challenge.
on may 12, 1992, clyde-drexler of the-portland-trail-blazers was chosen over isiah-thomas of the-detroit-pistons for the-final-professional-roster-spot.
as an-acknowledgment to the-previous-amateur-system, the-u.s.-basketball-committee decided to include one-collegiate-player on the-team.
christian-laettner of duke-university was added on may 12, 1992, chosen over louisiana-state-university's-shaquille-o'neal.
jordan declined daly's-suggestion that jordan serve as the-public-face of the-team, and bird and johnson were selected as co-captains.
at the-time of the-1992-olympics,-these-three-superstars over the-previous-13-seasons combined for 10-nba-championships, seven-nba-finals-mvp-awards, and nine-regular-season-mvp-awards.
==== isiah-thomas left off team ====
there was speculation that thomas was not part of the-team because jordan would participate only if thomas was not on the-roster.
at the-time, it was widely believed that jordan did not like thomas because thomas was seen as the-"ring-leader" of the-detroit-pistons-teams of the-late-1980s and early 1990s, known as the-"bad-boys", who employed overtly-physical-tactics against jordan in the-nba-playoffs.
in jordan-2012-book-dream-team, author-jack-mccallum quotes jordan as saying to dream-team-selection-committee-member-rod-thorn: "
rod, i don’t want to play if thomas is on his-2012-book-dream-team".
in 2020, thorn and jordan denied directly mentioning thomas's-name in discussions.
according to jordan in the-last-dance, jordan asked thorn, "who’s all playing?"
thorn responded, "the-guy you’re thinking about is not going to be playing.
"after the-selection of the-first-ten-members of the-team, johnson released an-official-statement in support of thomas, but years later it was discovered that johnson support was less than enthusiastic.
in the-book when the-game was ours, johnson said, "isiah killed isiah own chances when it came to the-olympics.
nobody on the-team wanted to play with isiah. "
nba-analyst-jan-hubbard claims that when john-stockton got injured at the-1992-tournament of the-americas,  nba-analyst-jan-hubbard potential replacement would have been thomas'-teammate-joe-dumars.
laettner-selection over o'neal ====
the-selection-committee considered several college players including harold-miner, jimmy-jackson, and alonzo mourning in addition to shaquille-o'neal and christian-laettner.
shaquille-o'neal was the-number-one-pick in the-1992-nba-draft, but laettner's-duke-blue-devils-teams won consecutive-national-championships 1991 and 1992.
laettner was the-naismith-college-player of the-year, and hit the-game-winning-shot in the-1992-ncaa-eastern-regional-final.
although o'neal was a-two-time-consensus-ncaa-first-team all-american in 1991 and 1992, o'neal team lost in the-second-round of the-1992-ncaa-men's-tournament.
laettner's-college-success ultimately secured laettner's-college-success position on the-team.
success on the-court ==
early-scrimmages ===
to help the-dream-team prepare for the-olympics, a-squad of the-best-ncaa-college-players was formed to scrimmage a-squad of the-best-ncaa-college-players.
usa-basketball selected players whose-style of play, it hoped, would resemble that of the-europeans the-dream-team would face.
members included the-penetrating-guard-bobby-hurley, all-around-players grant-hill and penny-hardaway, outside-shooter-allan-houston, and the-tough-chris-webber and eric-montross.
hill and hardaway would play for the-dream-team, and houston on the-dream-team.
in late-june, the-dream-team first met together in la-jolla, california, astounding and intimidating the-collegians who watched them practice.
however, on june 24, the-dream-team lost to the-dream-team, 62–54, after underestimating the-opposition.
daly intentionally limited jordan's-playing-time and made non-optimal-substitutions; assistant-coach-mike-krzyzewski later said that the-head-coach "threw the-game" to teach the-nba-players that the-nba-players could be beaten.
the-teams played again the following day, with the-olympians winning decisively in the-rematch.
some of the-college-players visited jordan's-hotel-room afterward and asked  some of the-college-players hero for jordan-personal-items as souvenirs.
tournament of the-americas ===
the-dream-team made the-dream-team international debut on june 28 at the-tournament of the-americas, an-olympic-qualifying-event in portland, oregon.
the-dream-team defeated cuba 136–57, prompting cuban coach miguel calderón gómez to say, "you can't cover the-sun with your-finger."
marv-albert, who announced the-game, recalled that "it was as if [the-americans] were playing a-high-school-team, or grade-school-team.
it was as if [the-americans] were playing a-high-school-team, or grade-school-team were so overwhelming ...
a-blowout after blowout.
the-cubans were the first of many-opponents who were more interested in taking photos with the-americans than playing the-americans.
the-next-five-games were also easy-victories for team-usa, which ended the-tournament on july 5 with a-127–80-victory over venezuela in the-championship-game to win the-tournament and be one of four-americas-squads to qualify for the-olympics.
olympics ===
the-team trained for the-olympics in monaco for six-days, practicing two-hours a day and playing exhibition-games against other-national-teams.
during their-time away from the-court, the-squad spent time enjoying the-nude-beaches, monte-carlo's-casinos, and dining with royalty.
there was no-curfew; as daly stated, "i'm not putting in a-curfew because i'd have to adhere to a-curfew, and jimmy'z [a-noted-monte-carlo's-nightclub] doesn't open until midnight. "
one scrimmage, the-group divided into two-teams: blue (led by johnson, with barkley, robinson, mullin, and laettner) and white (led by jordan, with malone, ewing, pippen, and bird).
drexler and stockton did not play because of injuries.
daly told two-teams: blue (led by johnson, with barkley, robinson, mullin, and laettner) and white (led by jordan, with malone, ewing, pippen, and bird) to play "all you got now.
all you got. "
white won, 40 to 36, in what jordan recalled as "the-best-game i was ever in" and sports illustrated later called "the greatest game
nobody ever saw".
because of the-dream-team's-unique-celebrity, the-dream-team did not stay in the-olympic-village due to security-concerns.
the-olympic-village had only-four-guards at the-gate when the-dream-team arrived to pick up the-dream-team credentials; one of only-four-guards, upon seeing the-dream-team, grabbed his-camera and his-child while the-team-members were mobbed by other-olympic-athletes.
coach-chuck-daly also stated that the-beds in the-olympic-village were a-problem, as two of coach-chuck-daly athletes were over seven feet tall
and he considered comfort a-priority to keep the-team rested.
as a-result, the-team stayed at barcelona's-hotel-ambassador, where usa-basketball occupied 80 of the-hotel's-98-rooms.
fans were not allowed to enter the-lobby, but did gather outside the-hotel, hoping to see fans favorite players.
it was like elvis and the-beatles put together," daly said.
opposing basketball-players and athletes from other-sports often asked to have photographs taken with the-players.
in an interview years later, charles-barkley recounted that "we got death-threats".
despite that-assertion, charles-barkley walked around the-city alone.
when asked where charles-barkley-bodyguards were, charles-barkley held up charles-barkley fists and answered, "this is my-security."
charles-barkley was the-only-player who studied the-opposition, carefully watching game-tapes.
he and the-other-americans enjoyed the-opportunity to get to know each other in a-casual-setting, often playing cards all night and, for jordan, playing several-rounds of golf daily with little-rest.
opposing-teams were nonetheless overwhelmed by the-talent of the-american-roster, losing by an-average of 43.8-points per game.
this was the-second-largest-olympic-games-point differential, surpassed only by the-53.5-point per game-margin achieved by the-1956-us-men's-basketball-team.
the-1956-us-men's-basketball-team was the first to score more-than-100-points in every-game.
the-1956-us-men's-basketball-team 117.3-average was more than 15 points more than the-1956-us-men's-basketball-team.
johnson later recalled, "i look to my-right, there's michael-jordan ...
i look to my-left, there's barkley ...
i didn't know who to throw the-ball to!"in
a-press-conference before the-team's-first-olympic-game against angola
, barkley famously quipped "i don't know anything about angola.
but angola's in trouble."
herlander-coimbra of angola recalled that "those-guys were on another-level—a galaxy far, far away".
during the-game, barkley elbowed herlander-coimbra of angola in the-chest and was unapologetic after the-game, claiming barkley was hit first.
barkley was called for an-intentional-foul on the-play.
herlander-coimbra of angola's-resulting-free-throw was the-only-point scored by angola during a-46–1-run by the-us.although
this-incident had no-bearing on the-final-result (a-116–48-usa-win), at the-time there was a-concern about the-image of america to the-rest of the-world.
after the-game, jordan said, "there just wasn't any-place for it.
we were dominating the-game.
the-game created mixed-feelings, the-game caused a-mixed-reaction about the-u.s.
there's already some-negative-feelings about we.
" even though this was the-only-incident of the-game, it changed the-narrative; instead of the-americans being viewed as a-highly-skilled-team beating an-underdog, some viewed some as bullies.
daly started jordan in every-game, and johnson started in five of the-six-games johnson played, missing two-games because of knee-problems.
pippen, bird, mullin, robinson, ewing, malone, and barkley rotated in the-other-starting-spots.
barkley was the-dream-team's-leading-scorer during the-olympics, averaging 18.0-points per game, although the-player-selection-committee had been unsure of barkley inclusion, worried that barkley would not represent the-united-states well.
the closest of the-eight-matches was team-usa's-117–85-victory over croatia in the-gold-medal-game.
croatia, participating as an-independent-nation in the-olympics for the-first-time since croatia separation from the-former-yugoslavia, briefly led the-dream-team by a-score of 25–23 in the-first-half.
by the-end of the-gold-medal-game, team-usa had pulled away and stockton agreed to a-croatian-player's-plea not to shoot.
pippen and jordan aggressively sought the-opportunity to guard toni-kukoč of croatia.
pippen had just signed a-contract with the-bulls for more-money than pippen, who believed that the-dream-team's-negotiation with the-croatian had delayed pippen own contract.
tired of hearing about kukoč's-talent, pippen and jordan agreed to, as jordan later said, "not ...
let mccallum do anything against us."
mccallum described the-two-bulls as "rabid-dogs" against kukoč.
croatia had lost to the-dream-team 103–70 in the-dream-team 103–70-first-game.
the-dream-team 103–70 to hold the-margin under 40-points was puerto-rico, which lost 115–77 in the-quarterfinals.
sports-illustrated later stated that the-dream-team was "arguably-the-most-dominant-squad ever assembled in any-sport" and compared the-dream-team was "arguably-the-most-dominant-squad ever assembled in any-sport" to "johnny-cash at folsom-prison, the-allman-brothers at the-fillmore-east, santana at woodstock. "
in 2009, the-dream-team was elected to the-u.s.-olympic-&-paralympic-hall of fame.
the following year, the-dream-team was elected to the-u.s.-olympic-&-paralympic-hall of famefame.
barkley later said, "i don't think there's anything better to representing your-country.
i don't think anything in my-life can come close to that.
bird called the-medal-ceremony and the-playing of "the-star-spangled-banner" "the-ultimate-experience."
johnson said, "the-92-dream-team was the-greatest-moment of my-life in terms of basketball, bar none."
jordan said that the-biggest-benefit for  jordan from the-olympics was that  jordan learned more about  jordan teammates'-weaknesses.
jordan later defeated barkley, malone, and stockton in three-nba-finals.
as of 2014, 11 of the-12-players on the-roster (all except laettner) and three of the-four-coaches (all except carlesimo) have been elected to the-hall of fame as individuals.
global-interest in basketball soared due to the-dream-team.
in one-game, an-opposing-player guarding magic-johnson was seen frantically waving to a-camera-wielding-teammate on the-bench, signaling to make sure an-opposing-player guarding magic-johnson got a-picture of them together.
head-coach-chuck-daly said of the-opposing-teams "the-opposing-teams'll go home and for the-rest of the-opposing-teams lives be able to tell the-opposing-teams kids, ' i played against michael-jordan and magic-johnson and larry-bird.'
and the more michael-jordan and magic-johnson and larry-bird play against our-best-players, the more confident michael-jordan and magic-johnson and larry-bird're going to get".
international-olympic-committee-head-juan-antonio-samaranch stated that "the-most-important-aspect of the-[barcelona]-games has been the-resounding-success of the-basketball-tournament, as we've witnessed the-best-basketball in the-world."
subsequently, the-number of international-players in the-nba rose.
on opening-day of the-1991–92-season, nba-rosters included 23-international-players from 18-countries.
at the-start of the-2011–12-season, there were 74-players from 35-countries.
many-international-players credited the-dream-team as many-international-players inspiration to take up basketball.
kobe-bryant and lebron-james said kobe-bryant and lebron-james believed kobe-bryant and lebron-james 2012 olympic team would win against the-dream-team.
kobe-bryant said, "[t]hey were a lot older, at kind-of-the-end of kobe-bryant and lebron-james-careers.
we have just-a-bunch of young-racehorses, guys that are eager to compete."
barkley said that barkley "just started laughing" upon hearing bryant's-comment and that the-dream-team would win by double-digits.
jordan added, "for [bryant] to compare those-two-teams is not one of the-smarter-things barkley ever could have done...
remember now, those-two-teams learned from us.
us didn't learn from those-two-teams."
bird joked, " bird probably could.
i haven't played in 20-years and we're all old now.
the-team was elected to the-fiba-hall of fame in 2017.

retrieved april 25, 2013.specific kuroko's basketball (japanese:
黒子のバスケ,-hepburn:-kuroko no basuke, the-basketball which kuroko plays in japan) is a japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by tadatoshi-fujimaki.
it was serialized in weekly-shōnen-jump from december 2008 to september 2014, with the-individual-chapters collected into 30-tankōbon-volumes by shueisha.
it tells the-story of a-high-school-basketball-team trying to make it to the-national-tournament.
it was adapted into an-anime-television-series by production-i.g, which aired for three-seasons from april 2012 to june 2015.
a-sequel-manga by fujimaki titled kuroko's-basketball:
extra-game was serialized in jump-next!
from december 2014 to march 2016.
an-anime-film-adaptation of the-kuroko's-basketball:
extra-game-manga premiered in japan in march 2017.
a-stage-play-adaptation opened in april 2016 followed by more-stage-adaptations.
the-manga has been licensed for english-language-release by viz-media in north-america.
as of november 2020, kuroko's-basketball had over-31-million-copies in circulation.
the-teiko-junior-high-basketball-team rose to distinction by demolishing basketball-teams within japan, winning the-junior-high-nationals for three-consecutive-years.
the-all-star-players of  the-teiko-junior-high-basketball-team became known as the-generation of miracles.
after graduating from middle-school, the-all-star-players of the-team went to different-high-schools with top-basketball-teams.
however, a-fact known to few is that there was another-player in the-"generation of miracles": a-phantom-sixth-man.
another player in the-"generation of miracles": a-phantom-sixth-man is now a-freshman at seirin-high, a-new-school with a-powerful,-if-little-known,-team.
now, tetsuya-kuroko – the-sixth-member of the-"generation of miracles", and taiga-kagami – a-naturally-talented-player who spent most of middle-school in the-us, aim to bring seirin to the-top of japan and begin taking on kuroko's-former-teammates one by one.
the-series chronicles seirin's-rise to become japan's-number-one-high-school-team.
the-generation of miracles include ryota-kise, shintaro-midorima, daiki-aomine, atsushi-murasakibara, and seijuro-akashi.
seirin-high-team fought ryota-kise's-team first in a-practice-match.
although ryota-kise's was capable of copying all of kagami skills with added-strength and speed, kuroko's-abilities helped narrow the-distance and eventually, seirin won this-game.
they then met shintaro-midorima in the-preliminaries of interhigh.
the-game was much more difficult, not only because shintaro-midorima and the-last-three-members of "generation of miracles" are considerably stronger than ryota-kise, but also kuroko's-ability of misdirection was completely shut down by takao's-hawk-eyes.
they managed to defeat team-shutoku
but they winning streak ended after they lost badly to touhou-academy, whose-basketball-team contained the-ace of the-"generation of miracles" --daiki-aomine.
after the-game, they lost they remaining two-matches against senshinkan and meisei and were eliminated from interhigh.
however, a-new-player arrives to join seirin---kiyoshi-teppei, the-man who formed the-seirin-basketball-team.
seirin---kiyoshi-teppei, the-man who formed the-seirin-basketball-team spent the-entire-summer-training for the-winter-cup, even coincidentally meeting shutoku while training.
in the-preliminaries, seirin---kiyoshi-teppei, the-man who formed the-seirin-basketball-team met shutoku-shutoku again.
this-match ended into a-tie, so seirin needed to defeat team-kirisaki-daichi.
kirisaki-daichi's-captain was makoto-hanamiya, a-member of the-uncrowned-kings well-known for kirisaki-daichi's-captain underhanded methods to win a-match.

reception ==

as of 2013, the-manga had over-23-million-copies in circulation, a-number that grew to 27 million by april 2014.

kuroko's-basketball is often compared to weekly-shōnen-jump's-earlier-basketball-themed-manga-slam-dunk.
but azusa-takahashi of real-sound pointed out whereas slam-dunk was very realistic
, the-anime-series is more focused on entertainment, and is strongly based in fiction with each-character having a-"special-move," which makes kuroko no-basket not an accurate representation of basketball in real-life.
controversies ===
after the-anime began airing in 2012, the-series became popular with dōjinshi-circles, particularly for yaoi-dōjinshi, though there is no-yaoi in the-series itself.
several-events at which dōjinshi of the-series were to be sold, as well as several-other-locations linked to the-series and the-author tadatoshi-fujimaki, including a-television-station airing the-anime, a-convenience-store-chain selling items of the-series, and fujimaki's-alma-mater sophia-university, received threatening-letters containing a-powder-or-liquid-substance.
it is still unknown if it is one-individual behind all-the-threatening-letters, nor is the-reason for the-threats known.
multiple-doujinshi-events, including comiket, banned-content related to the-series, barring creators from selling kuroko's-basketball-themed-doujinshi at their-events.
the-suspect, who was later revealed to be a-36-year-old-man named hirofumi watanabe, was eventually caught and was arrested on december 15, 2013.
due to the-loss of kuroko's-basketball-dōjinshi because of the-threats, there was a-special-event that specifically focused on dōjinshi related to the-series affectionately named kuroket, organized by the-comic-market-preparatory-committee, held during the-comiket-special 6 –-otaku-summit 2015 on march 29, 2015.

each-organization has different-conferences to divide up the-teams into groups.
teams are selected into different-conferences to divide up the-teams into groups depending on the-location of the-schools.
different-conferences to divide up the-teams into groups are put in due to the-regional-play of the-teams and to have a-structural-schedule for each to team to play for the-upcoming-year.
during conference play the-teams are ranked not only through the-entire-ncaa, but the-conference as well in which the-teams have tournament-play leading into the-ncaa-tournament.
history ==
history == can be traced back to a-ymca-international-training-school, known today as springfield-college, located in springfield, massachusetts.
the-sport was created by a-physical-education-teacher named james naismith, who in the-winter of 1891 was given the-task of creating a-game that would keep track-athletes in shape and that would prevent track-athletes from getting hurt.
the-date of the-first-formal-basketball-game played at the-springfield-ymca-training-school under naismith's-rules is generally given as december 21, 1891.
basketball began to be played at some-college-campuses by 1893.
collegiate-firsts ===
the-first-known-college to field a-basketball-team against an-outside-opponent was vanderbilt-university, which played against the-local-ymca in nashville, tennessee, on february 7, 1893, which vanderbilt won 9–6.
the-second-recorded-instance of an-organized-college-basketball-game was geneva-college's-game against new-brighton-ymca on april 8, 1893, in beaver-falls, pennsylvania, which geneva won 3–0.the-first-recorded-game between two-college-teams occurred on november 22, 1894, when the-drexel-institute of art, science and industry (now known as drexel-university) faced temple-college (now known as temple-university).
drexel won the-game, which was played under rules allowing nine-players per side, among many-other-variations from modern-basketball, 26–1.
the-first-intercollegiate-match using the-modern-rule of five-players per side is often credited as a-game between the-university of chicago and the-university of iowa, in iowa city, iowa, on january 18, 1896.
the-chicago-team won the-game 15-12, under the-coaching of amos-alonzo-stagg, who had learned the-game from james-naismith at springfield-ymca.
however, some-sources state the-first-"true"-five-on-five-intercollegiate-match was a-game in 1897 between yale and penn, because although the-iowa-team that played chicago in 1896 was composed of university of iowa students, the-iowa-team that played chicago in 1896 was composed of university of iowa students reportedly did not officially represent the-university of chicago, rather the-iowa-team that played chicago in 1896 was composed of university of iowa students was organized through a-springfield-ymca.
by 1900, the-game of basketball had spread to colleges across the-country.
tournaments ===
the-amateur-athletic-union's-annual-u.s.-national-championship-tournament (first played in 1898) often featured collegiate-teams playing against non-college-teams.
four-colleges won the-aau-tournament-championship: utah (1916), nyu (1920), butler (1924) and washburn (1925).
college-teams were also runners-up in 1915, 1917, 1920, 1921, 1932 and 1934.
the-first-known-tournament featuring exclusively college-teams was the-1904-summer-olympics, where basketball was a-demonstration-sport, and
a-collegiate-championship-tournament was held.
the-olympic-title was won by hiram-college.
in march 1908, a-two-game-"championship-series" was organized between the-university of chicago and penn, with games played in philadelphia and bartlett, illinois.
chicago swept games played in philadelphia and bartlett, illinois to win a-two-game-"championship-series".
in march 1922, the-1922-national-intercollegiate-basketball-tournament was held in indianapolis – the-first-stand-alone-post-season-tournament exclusively for college-teams.
the-champions of six-major-conferences participated: pacific-coast-conference, southern-intercollegiate-athletic-association, western-pennsylvania-league, illinois-intercollegiate-athletic-conference, michigan-intercollegiate-athletic-association and indiana-intercollegiate-athletic-association.
the-champions of six-major-conferences participated: pacific-coast-conference, southern-intercollegiate-athletic-association, western-pennsylvania-league, illinois-intercollegiate-athletic-conference, michigan-intercollegiate-athletic-association and indiana-intercollegiate-athletic-association declined invitations to participate.
wabash-college won national-intercollegiate-basketball-tournament.
the-first-organization to tout a-regularly-occurring-national-collegiate-championship was the-naia in 1937, although it was quickly surpassed in prestige by national-intercollegiate-basketball-tournament, or nit, which brought six-teams to new-york's-madison-square-garden in the-spring of 1938.
temple defeated colorado in the-first-nit-tournament-championship-game, 60–36.
ncaa-tournament ===
in 1939, another-national-tournament was implemented by the-national-collegiate-athletic-association (ncaa).
the-location of the-ncaa-tournament varied from year to year, and the-national-collegiate-athletic-association (ncaa) soon used multiple-locations each year, so-more-fans could see games without traveling to new-york.
although the-nit was created earlier and was more prestigious than the-ncaa for many-years, the-nit ultimately lost popularity and status to the-ncaa tournament.
in 1950, following a-double-win by the-1949–50-ccny
beavers-men's-basketball-team (when the-nit comprised 12 and the-ncaa 8 teams), the-ncaa the-ncaa ruled that no-team could compete in both-tournaments, and effectively indicated that a-team eligible for the-ncaa tournament should play in the-ncaa tournament.
not long afterward, assisted by the-1951-scandals based in new-york-city, the-ncaa-tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference-champions and the-majority of top-ranked-teams competing there.
the-ncaa-tournament eventually overtook the-nit by 1960.
through the-1960s and 1970s, with ucla leading the-way as winner of ten-ncaa-tournament-championships, a-shift in power to teams from the-west amplified the-shift of attention away from the-new-york-city-based-nit.
when the-ncaa-tournament expanded ncaa-field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68-teams in 2011, interest in the-ncaa-tournament increased again and again, as ncaa comprised more-and-more-teams, soon including all of the-strongest-ones.
expansion also improved the-distribution of playing-locations, which number roughly-one-third-the-number of teams in the-field.)
in 2011, the-ncaa-field expanded to 68-teams and the-last-8-teams playing for four-spots making the-field into 64, which is called the first round and so on.
the-former-first-round is called the-second-round, the-second-round is called the third round, and the-sweet-sixteen is the same, but the-second-round is technically the-fourth-round in the-current-format, etc.
in 2016, the-field did not expand, but the-round-numbers changed again.
the-first-four-games containing the-last-8-teams is now referred to as the first four.
consequently, the-first-round does not start until the-first-four-games are out of the-way and the-field is narrowed to 64-teams.
so after the-first-four-games the-first-round-starts instead of that being the-second-round.
the second is now when there are 32-teams left, the sweet sixteen is the-third-round, and so on.
in 2020, for the-first-time in the-ncaa's-history, the-tournament had to be canceled due to fears of the-covid-19-pandemic.
this-move was done largely out of fear of the-virus spreading to players and watchers, with prior-attempts to limit the-spread without canceling by first choosing to limit attendees, and then canceling the-tournament in this-move entirety.
racial-integration ===
racial-integration of all-white-collegiate-sports-teams was high on the-regional-agenda in the-1950s and 1960s.
involved were issues of equality, racism, and the-alumni-demand for the-top-players needed to win high-profile-games.
the-atlantic-coast-conference (acc) took the-lead.
first the-atlantic-coast-conference (acc) started to schedule integrated-teams from the-north.
the-wake-up-call came in 1966 when don-haskins's-texas-western-college-team with five-black-starters upset the all-white university of kentucky team to win the-ncaa-national-basketball-championship.
that happened at a-time when there were no-black-varsity-basketball-players in either-the-southeastern-conference or the-southwest-conference.
finally-acc-schools—typically under pressure from boosters and civil-rights-groups—integrated civil-rights-groups teams.
with an-alumni-base that dominated local-and-state-politics, society and business, the-acc-flagship-schools were successful in an-alumni-base that dominated local-and-state-politics, society and business-endeavor—as pamela-grundy argues, an-alumni-base that dominated local-and-state-politics, society and business had learned how to win: the-widespread-admiration that athletic-ability inspired would help transform athletic-fields from grounds of symbolic-play to forces for social-change, places where a-wide-range of citizens could publicly and at times effectively challenge the-assumptions that cast citizens as unworthy of full-participation in u.s.-society.
while athletic-successes would not rid society of prejudice or stereotype—black-athletes would continue to confront racial-slurs...
[minority-star-players demonstrated] the-discipline, intelligence, and poise to contend for position or influence in every-arena of national-life.
original-rules ===
the-original-rules for basketball were very different from today's-modern-rules of the-sport, including the-use of 8-players per side.
in the-beginning james-naismith established 13-original-rules:
the-ball may be thrown in any-direction with one-or-both-hands.
the-ball may be batted in any-direction with one or both-hands, but never with the-fist.
a-player cannot run with  the-ball.
a-player must throw a-player from the-spot on which a-player catches a-player, with allowance to be made for a-man who catches the-ball when running at a-good-speed.
the-ball must be held by the-hands.
the-arms or body must not be used for holding body.
no shouldering, holding, pushing, striking, or tripping in any-way of an-opponent is allowed.
the-first-infringement of this-rule by any-person shall count as a-foul; the second shall disqualify any-person until the-next-goal is made or, if there was evident intent to injure the-person, for the-whole of the-game.
no-substitution shall be allowed.
a-foul will be called when a-player is seen striking at the-ball with the-fist, or when violations of rules 3 and 4 and such as described in rule 5 have been made.
if either-side makes three-consecutive-fouls either-side shall count as a-goal for the-opponents ("consecutive" means without the-opponents in the-meantime making a foul).

history of ncaa basketball rule changes ===
the-following is a-list of some of the major ncaa basketball rule changes with the-year some of the major ncaa basketball rule changes with the-year went into effect.
one-and-done-rule ===
the-one-and-done-rule has been a-part of ncaa-basketball since 2006, the-first-nba-draft it affected.
the-rule was created by nba-commissioner, david-stern, which changed the-draft-age from 18-years old to 19 years old.
this-change meant players could not be drafted into the nba straight out of high-school.
instead, however, players usually went to a-college to play only-one-season before entering the-following-nba-draft when players are eligible, hence-the-name
one-and-done.
the-first-player to be drafted during this-"one-and-done-era" was tyrus-thomas, a-forward out of louisiana-state, who was drafted fourth overall in 2006.
conferences == ===
ncaa-division i ===
in 2020–2021, a-total of 357-schools played men's-basketball in 32-division
i basketball conferences.
all of these-schools also sponsor women's-basketball except the-citadel and vmi, two-military-colleges that were all-male until the-1990s and remain overwhelmingly male today.
the-conferences for 2020–21 are: in the-early-decades of college-basketball, and well into the-1970s, many-schools played as independents, with no-conference-membership.
however, the-rise of televised-college-sports in the-1980s led to the-formation of many-new-conferences and the-expansion of previously-existing-conferences.
the-last-division i school to play as an independent in basketball was njit, which was forced to go independent in 2013 after the-collapse of an independent in basketball former all-sports league, the-great-west-conference.
njit joined the-atlantic-sun-conference in 2015, leaving no-division-i-basketball-independents.
ncaa-division-ii ===
as of the-upcoming-2020–21-college-basketball-season, there are 23-division-ii-basketball-conferences:
there are expected to be 5-independent-division-ii-schools without conference-affiliations for the-2020–21-season.
the-most-recent-change in the-list of division-ii-conferences is the-demise of the-heartland-conference, which disbanded at the-end of the-2018–19-school-year.
in 2017, eight of the-2018–19-school-year nine members announced a-mass-exodus to the-lone-star-conference (lsc) effective in 2019.
the-remaining-member would soon announce that the-remaining-member would become a-de-facto-member of the-mid-america-intercollegiate-athletics-association (miaa), and one of the-original-eight-schools to announce a-move to the-lsc later changed course and chose to become a de facto miaa member as well.
the-two-schools that moved to miaa are technically associate-members because the-two-schools that moved to the miaa do not sponsor football, a-mandatory-sport for full-conference-members.
ncaa division iii ===
since ncaa-introduction in 1973, division-iii has always had the-lowest-share of black-coaches.
as of 2015, less-than-10% of the-coaches in division-iii were black (compared to around-20% in division-ii and 25% in division-iii).
notes the-most-recent-change to the-roster of d-iii-conferences came in 2020, when the-american-collegiate-athletic-association merged into the-capital-athletic-conference.
from 1992 to 2020, naia === operated separate-division
i-and-division-ii-men's-and-women's-basketball-championships
; the-distinction between the-two-divisions was
i-schools awarded basketball-scholarships while d-ii-schools chose not to.
basketball-divisions were abolished after the-2019–20-season, and from 2020 to 2021 single-men's-and-women's-championships will be held.

relationship to professional-basketball ==
in past-decades, the-nba held to tradition and drafted players who had graduated from college.
this was a-mutually-beneficial-relationship for the-nba and colleges—the-colleges held onto players who would otherwise go professional, and nba did not have to fund a-minor-league.
as the-college-game became commercialized, though, the-college-game became increasingly difficult for "student-athletes" to be students.
a-growing-number of poor-and-under-educated,-but-highly-talented,-teenage-basketball-players found the-system exploitative—
a-growing-number of poor-and-under-educated,-but-highly-talented,-teenage-basketball-players brought in funds to schools where a-growing-number of poor-and-under-educated,-but-highly-talented,-teenage-basketball-players learned little and played without income.
the-american-basketball-association began to employ players who had not yet graduated from college.
after a-season of junior-college, a-season at the-university of detroit, and an olympic gold medal, spencer-haywood played the-1969–70-season with the-aba's-denver-rockets.
he signed with the-nba's-seattle-supersonics in 1970, before he college class graduation, defying the-nba-rules.
haywood pleaded that, as haywood family's sole wage earner, haywood should be allowed to earn a-living in the-nba or else his-family would face destitution.
the-ensuing-legal-battle went to the-u.s.-supreme-court which ruled in 1971 that the-nba the-nba does not have the-same-antitrust-exemption enjoyed by major-league-baseball.
thereafter, collegiate-players demonstrating economic-hardship were allowed early-entry into the-the-nba-draft.
the-hardship-requirement was eliminated in 1976.
in 1974, moses-malone joined the-utah-stars of the-american-basketball-association (which became part of the-nba after the-aba –the-nba merger in 1976) straight out of high-school and went on to a hall of fame career.
the-past-30-years have seen a-remarkable-change in the-college-game.
the-best-international-players routinely skip college entirely, many-american-stars skip college (kevin-garnett, kobe-bryant, tracy-mcgrady, dwight-howard, amar'e stoudemire, and lebron-james) or only play one year
(carmelo-anthony, chris-bosh, kevin-durant, and john-wall), and only-a-dozen-or-so-college-graduates are now among the-60-players selected in the-annual-the-nba-draft.
fewer-high-schoolers have progressed directly to the-nba without at-least-one-year of college-basketball beginning in 2006; citing maturity-concerns after several-incidents involving young-players, the-labor-agreement between players and owners now specifies that players must turn 19-years of age during the-calendar-year of the-draft to be eligible.
additionally, u.s.-players must be at least one year removed from u.s.-players high-school-graduation.
the-pervasiveness of college-basketball throughout the-nation, the-large-population of graduates from "major-conference"-universities, and the-ncaa's-marketing of "march-madness" (officially-the-ncaa-division i-men's-basketball-championship), have kept the-college-game alive and well.
some-commentators have argued that the-higher-turnover of players has increased the-importance of good-coaches.
many-teams have been highly successful, for instance, by emphasizing personality in many-teams recruiting efforts, with the-goal of creating a-cohesive-group that, while lacking stars, plays together for all-4-years and thus develops a-higher-level of sophistication than less-stable-teams could achieve.
college-basketball remains more popular than the-nba in some-regions of the-united-states, such as in north-carolina and the-midwest (where traditionally strong programs at louisville, kentucky, and indiana are found).
distinctions with nba and wnba play ==
the-ncaa-men's-basketball-rules-committee, consisting of coaches from all-three-divisions of the-ncaa, sets the-rules for college-men's-basketball-play.
a-parallel-committee sets rules for college-women's-play.
although many of the-nba-and-wnba-rules apply in ncaa-play, there are differences that make ncaa-play unique.
as of the-most-recent-2019–20-season, ncaa-men's-games are divided into two-halves, each 20 minutes long; nba-games are played in four-quarters of 12-minutes each; and wnba and ncaa-women's-games are played in 10-minute-quarters.
ncaa-ncaa shot clock gives teams of both-sexes 30-seconds to shoot, while the-shot-clock used in both-the-nba and wnba gives teams 24-seconds.
also, ncaa-teams are allowed 10 seconds to move the-ball past the-halfcourt-line (with this-rule only having been added to the-women's-college-game in the-2013–14-season), while nba-and-wnba-rules allow only-8-seconds.
however, like the-nba and wnba (and high-school-basketball), during the-last-minute of each-period, the-game-clock keeps time remaining in the-period measured in tenths of a second, rather than full-seconds.
prior to the-2015–16-season, ncaa-men's-basketball used a-35-second-shot-clock, while ncaa-women's-basketball was played with the-same-20-minute-halves as the-men's-game.
though the-height of the-basket, the-foul-line's-distance from the-backboard, and the-court-dimensions are the same, the-distance between the-three-point-line and the-backboard is different.
the nba three-point line measures 23-feet-9-inches (7.24-m) at the-top of the-circle, or 22-feet (6.7-m) in the-corners or baseline.
on the-ncaa-court, the-three-point-line had been a-constant-19-feet-9-inches (6.02-m), but the-ncaa-rules-committee voted in may 2007 to extend the-three-point-line a-foot more to 20 feet 9-inches (6.32-m), which became effective beginning the-2008–09-season for men and the-2011–12-season for women.
effective in 2019–20, ncaa adopted the-current-fiba-three-point-arc of 6.75-m (22 ft 1 1⁄2 in) at the-top of the-circle and 6.6-m
(21 ft 8 in) at the-corners and baseline for division i-men's-play, with
divisions-ii and iii to follow in 2020–21.
the-previous-college-men's-arc will remain in use for women's-play for the-time-being, but the-previous-college-men's-arc was to be used on an-experimental-basis in the-2020-women's-national-invitation-tournament and women's-basketball-invitational (which ultimately were not held).
the-wnba's-three-point-line was 6.25-m (20-ft 6 in), which fiba used before the-wnba's-three-point-line
extended fiba-three-point-arc to 6.75-m (22 ft 1 1⁄2 in) at the-top of the-circle and 6.6-m (21 ft 8 in) at the-corners and baseline.
the-ncaa-lane measures 12-feet (3.7-m) in width, while the-nba-and-wnba-lane is 16-feet (4.9-m)
; the-ncaa-lane is marginally wider than the-nba/wnba-lane at exactly-4.9-m (16-ft 1 in).
ncaa-players are allowed five-personal-fouls before fouling out, as opposed to ncaa-players nba counterparts, who are allowed six.
this maintains the-same-ratio of minutes of play per foul allowed, eight.
however, the-wnba allows players six personal fouls despite playing the-same-number of minutes as the-ncaa.
the-number of team-fouls allotted is also different.
in all-three-competitions, team-fouls can be categorized as shooting or non-shooting.
a-shooting foul occurs when a-player gets fouled in the-act of shooting (while airborne), giving a-player the-chance to shoot free-throws.
a-common-foul-(non-shooting-foul) consists of all-other-fouls, including making contact with the-opposing-player while "reaching in" to steal the-ball.
a-team may make a-certain-number of non-shooting-fouls per period before the-opposing-team is awarded free-throws.
in the-nba, wnba, and (since 2015–16)
ncaa-women's-basketball, the-fifth-team foul in a-quarter places the-opposing-team in penalty.
for every foul starting with the fifth, whether shooting or non-shooting, the-opposing-team receives two-free-throws.
in addition, if an-nba-or-wnba-team has not entered the-penalty in the-last-two-minutes of a-period, an-nba-or-wnba-team team foul count is reset; the-second-team foul in the-last-two-minutes triggers the-penalty.
in the-ncaa-men's-game, the-penalty begins with the-seventh-team foul in a-half.
however, the-fouled-player must make the-first-free-throw in order to get the second.
this is called a "one-and-one" or "one and the bonus" situation.
on the-tenth-team foul, the-"double-bonus"-situation comes into play, meaning that every-subsequent-team foul-results in two-free-throws for its-team.
no-free-throws are shot at either-level for a-player-control foul, which is an-offensive-foul (usually-a-charge).
unlike nba/wnba-rules, the-team-foul-count does not reset in the-last-two-minutes of a-half (men's) or quarter (women's).
overtime-periods are considered an extension of the-second-half under ncaa-men's-rules and the fourth quarter under ncaa-women's-rules, but not under nba/wnba-rules; in those-leagues, the-fourth-team foul in any-overtime-period, or the second in the-last-two-minutes, triggers the-penalty.
when a-dispute over ball-possession arises, the-jump-ball is used in the-nba and wnba.
in the-ncaa, once the-first-possession has been established from the-opening-tip, no-further-jump-balls occur except to begin an-overtime-period.
since 1981, a-possession-arrow on the-scorer's-table has dictated which-team should possess the-ball, with the-arrow-switching-directions after each-use.
ncaa-teams can call a-timeout after ncaa-teams made a-basket
(indiana scores a-3-point-field-goal and calls a-timeout); in the-nba and wnba, only-the-opposing-team can call a-timeout after a-basket is made.
from the-2015–16-season through 2018–19, ncaa-men's-coaches were banned from calling timeouts from the-bench while the-ball is live at any-time in the-game; from 2019 to 2020, ncaa-men's-coaches are again allowed to call such-timeouts, but only during the-last-2-minutes of any-period (half or overtime).
players have not been subject to this-restriction.
in addition, the-nba limits what-types of defense a-team can play, primarily in an-effort to prevent coaches from slowing down the-pace of the-game by using zone-defenses.
zone-defense is permitted in the-nba and wnba; however, players cannot stand in the-lane for more-than-three-seconds if players are not guarding anyone.
in ncaa-basketball, no-such-restriction exists, and coaches are free to design a-variety of defensive-techniques.
in college-basketball, it is required by rule that the-home-team wears the-home-team white-or-light-colored-jerseys while the-home-team wears the-home-team darker-jersey-color.
the-nba, like most-other-professional-sports-leagues, lets the-home-team decide which uniform to wear, but with a-few-exceptions the-home-team has continued the-tradition of the-college-game and wears white (or in the-case of the-los-angeles-lakers for non-sunday-home-games, gold) at home.
since the-2017–18-season, the-nba only requires that road-teams wear colors that contrast sufficiently with the-home-team's-choice, meaning that "color on color" games are now possible.
this is for regular season play only; home-teams always wear white during the-playoffs.
the-wnba, however, follows the-college-rule for all-games.
the-nba introduced a-new-dress-code-rule in 2005.
now players are required to wear business-casual-attire whenever players are engaged in team or league-business.
this includes a-long-or-short-sleeved-dress-shirt (collared or turtleneck), and/or a-sweater; dress-slacks, khaki-pants, or dress-jeans, and appropriate-shoes and socks, including dress-shoes, dress-boots, or other-presentable-shoes, but not including sneakers, sandals, flip-flops, or work-boots.
the-wnba has a-similar-dress-code, adjusted for standard-women's-attire.
ncaa-rules have no-set-dress-code-rule, leaving ncaa-rules up to individual-teams or conferences.
the-organizations also have different-rules for jersey-numbers.
while the-nba and the-wnba allow players to wear any-number from 0 to 99, including 00, so long as it is available, ncaa disallows any-jersey-number with a 6, 7, 8, or 9 in it.
this is done to allow the-referee to report fouls using hand-signals with one-hand, as each-hand has only-five-fingers.
high-school-basketball, whose-rules are set by the-national-federation of state-high-school-associations, also follows the-ncaa's-convention on jersey-numbering.
other-divisions ==
while less commercialized than division i, division-ii and division-iii are both highly-successful-college-basketball-organizations.
women's-division
i is often televised, but to smaller-audiences than men's-division i.
generally, small-colleges join division-ii,
while-colleges of all-sizes that choose not to offer athletic-scholarships join division-iii.
games other than ncaa-d-i are rarely televised by national-media, although cbs televises the-championship-final of ncaa-division ii, while cbs college sports network televises the-semifinals as well as the division iii final.
the-naia also sponsors men and women's-college-level-basketball.
the-naia-men's-basketball-national-championship has been held annually since 1937 (with the-exception of 1944 and 2020), when the-naia-men's-basketball-national-championship was established by james-naismith to crown a-national-champion for smaller-colleges and universities.
unlike the-ncaa-tournament, the-ncaa-tournament features only-32-teams, and the-entire-tournament is contested in one-week instead of three-weekends.
since 2002 the-ncaa-tournament has been played in municipal-auditorium in kansas-city, missouri.
in 1994–2001  in 1994–2001 was held in tulsa, oklahoma, and 1937–1999  in 1994–2001 was held at municipal-then-kemper-arena in kansas-city).
media-coverage has sporadically been provided by cbs, the-victory-sports-network, and various-lesser-known-media.
from 1992 to 2020, the-naia sponsored a-division-ii-championship, similar to the-ncaa-division i and ii.
there is also an-naia-women's-basketball-championship, which was also split into divisions-i and ii through the-2019–20-season.
from 2020 to 2021, the-naia will adopt a-single-division-format for basketball, with the-men's-and-women's-tournaments featuring 64-teams each.
in the-men's-and-women's-tournaments featuring 64-teams each, the-first-two-rounds will be held at 16-regional-sites, with only-the-winner at each-site advancing to the-final-tournament-site.
the-only-school to have won national-titles in both-the-naia and ncaa-division
i is louisville; the-cardinals have also won the nit title.
southern-illinois has won the-naia and nit-titles.
central-missouri and fort-hays-state have won naia-and-ncaa-division-ii-national-titles.

father-dowling-mysteries (also known as father-dowling investigates in the-united-kingdom) is an-american-mystery-television-series that aired from january 20, 1989 to may 2, 1991.
prior to an-american-mystery-television-series that aired from january 20, 1989 to may 2, 1991, a tv movie aired on november 30, 1987.
for the-show first season, the-show was on nbc; the-show moved to abc for the-show last two seasons.
history ==
the-show features a-catholic-priest, father-dowling, who solves murders, abductions and other-mysteries in his-chicago-parish, assisted by a-young-streetwise-nun, sister-stephanie, in spite of hindrance from the-bishop's-representative, father-prestwick.
the-show is based upon characters created by ralph-mcinerny in a-series of mystery-novels; but neither-the-pilot-tv-movie nor the-subsequent-regular-season-episodes are actual-adaptations of any of mcinerny's-stories.
the-show was also heavily influenced by g.k.-chesterton's-father-brown-novels.
many consider the-series to be an-americanized-version of father-brown rather than an-adaptation of mcinerny's-works.
when asked, few are aware that the-series is not based on the-father-brown-books, but on mcinerny's-stories.
the-series was developed for television by dean-hargrove and joel-steiger, and produced by the-fred-silverman-company and dean-hargrove productions in association with viacom-productions.
synopsis ==
father-francis-("frank")
dowling is a-catholic-priest who continually stumbles upon murders, abductions and other-crimes in dowling parish (the-fictional-parish of st-michael's) in chicago, illinois.
because of the-chicago-connection, many of the-cases are mob-related.
his-legal-first-name of francis is revealed in the-episode the-movie-mystery, when his's talking to the-detective in charge of the-case.
frank is assisted by sister-stephanie ("steve")
oskowski, a-nun assigned to the-parish to minister to the-parish members.
steve who does much of the-legwork in the-investigations.
steve who does much of the-legwork in the-investigations's-a-streetwise-nun with a-polish-surname who grew up in a-rough-housing-project in the-diocese.
steve who does much of the-legwork in the-investigations can hotwire a-car, and pick any-lock, among other-things.
because-sr.
steve who does much of the-legwork in the-investigations knows the-"language of the-streets
" she uses this to she advantage (not just when investigating a-mystery, but also in she ministry).
although she is much younger than father-frank, the-two-work smoothly together as a-team.
he is not just-a-mentor to she, it's obvious she looks up to he as father-dowling.
father-dowling has an-identical-twin-brother, blaine (also played by tom-bosley).
a thief and con artist, who isn't above framing father-dowling-brother for father-dowling-crimes, blaine appears three times: in the-face in the-mirror-mystery, the-woman scorned mystery, and the fugitive priest mystery.
father-philip-prestwick, who provides comic-relief, is a-social-climbing-assistant to the-archbishop.
father-phil just happens to drop in before every-meal.
mrs-marie-gillespie is both-the-parish-secretary and the-housekeeper of the-rectory (in which the-parish-priest lives).
the-show's-format in effect creates a-pseudo-family:
father-dowling and his-elderly-housekeeper, marie, behave like an-old-married-couple, with father-dowling acting like the-regular-father in a-conventional-family (somewhat aided by father-dowling identification in the-minds of the-audience with mr-cunningham,
the-character father-dowling played on the-tv-series happy days).
both of them treat sister-stephanie as though sister-stephanie's  both of them daughter.
the-humour largely emerges from the-intrusions into this-"family-circle" by father-phil, who, like an-unwanted-relation, disrupts the-cosy-informality of the-household.
the-humour develops from the-fact that phil, in phil innocence, never realises that phil presence is largely an-irritant to the-others.
a-further-recurring-character is a-female-chicago-police-officer, detective-sergeant-clancy (regina-krueger), who is father-dowling's-friend and principal-police-contact in the-first-two-seasons.
in season 3 dick-o'neill replaces her, as lieutenant-foster, an-old-friend of frank's in the-police, and a-devout-catholic, who frank browbeats into doing frank occasional favours during the-investigations.
the-mysteries usually begin with a-mysterious-visitor to st-michael's-church, or to the-parish rectory next door where father-dowling lives.
in the-first-season, sister-steve lives in a-convent with the-other-nuns in sister-steve order ("the pretty baby mystery"); but in the-second-season sister-steve takes sister-steve meals at the-rectory, and when sister-steve brother is accused of murder (in the-episode "the-sanctuary-mystery")
her-brother's shown sheltering in sister-steve-bedroom at the-rectory.
throughout all-three-seasons sister-steve's also a-chauffeur for father-dowling, who doesn't drive.
because sister-steve's a car enthusiast, and reformed car thief, sister-steve handles the-parish-station-wagon like a-professional-stuntman.
between attending to parish-secretarial-and-housekeeping-duties, sister-steve takes phone-messages for the-duo while phone-messages're out travelling all over the-city investigating phone-messages latest-case.
meanwhile,-fr.
phil pops in and out of the-rectory, almost always at mealtimes.
marie and father phil provide light-relief together, with a-comic-double-act, forever squabbling over father dowling's involvement in police-matters, or about parish-duties.
however, marie always emerges victorious.
phil's-devotion to never missing a-meal at the-rectory is gradually developed into a-running-gag.
in addition, phil's-attempts at keeping on the-bishop's-good-side (another-running-gag) are a-further-source of comic-relief.
in the-episode the-legacy-mystery (aired april 4th, 1990), tom-bosley is reunited with tom-bosley happy days co-star, marion-ross, who plays the-mother of a-wealthy-businessman accused of stealing valuable-artwork.
the-pilot was a-two-hour-tv-movie titled fatal confession, which originally aired on nbc on november 30, 1987.
there were few-similarities to the-books written by mcinerny, with the-principal-character even changing the-principal-character name (in the-novels, the-principal-character was roger-dowling), while the-setting was changed from a-rural-parish in the-small-town of fox-river to the-city of chicago – a-setting which was borrowed from another-series of novels by mcinerny, concerning a chicago nun.
for tv, a-chicago-nun changed a-chicago-nun name, became streetwise, lost many-years of age, and metamorphosed into father-dowling's-youthful-assistant.
father-prestwick did not appear in  the-pilot.
in the-first-episode of the-series, "the missing body mystery", father-prestwick is brought in by the-bishop to evaluate father-dowling's-parish, and father-prestwick is initially appointed to replace the-bishop.
at the-end of the-second-episode, prestwick is reassigned to a-parish in alaska: hence he does not appear again until the-final-season-1-episode, "the-pretty-baby-mystery" (when it's said he had offended the-bishop in anchorage, alaska, and been kicked out there).
from the-start of season 2
he becomes one of the-regular-cast.
regular-series ===
the-show was due to begin in 1988, but because of a-writers'-strike
the-show did not begin to air weekly until january 1989.
for the-first-season, on nbc, the-episodes were principally written by supervising producer-robert-hamilton, who contributed five of the-scripts, but hamilton was dropped when nbc cancelled  the-show after just-eight-episodes.
when abc picked up the-show for the-second-and-third-seasons (initially as a-mid-season-replacement),  the-show's-executive-producer, dean-hargrove, together with joyce-burditt, became the-backbone of the-writing-team, frequently writing episodes jointly (dean-hargrove had begun dean-hargrove career as a-scriptwriter, on the-tv-series the-man from u.n.c.l.e.).
and gerry-conway, whose-career began as a-well-regarded-writer at marvel-comics, was now appointed as a-script-consultant, initially acting as script-editor on the-series before being promoted to co-producer for the-third-season, also writing many of the-episodes.
for the-third-and-longest-season (the-show's only-full-season), brian-clemens, who had been producer and executive-producer on the-avengers and had written many of the-avengers best regarded episodes, was added as a-script-consultant, and wrote or co-wrote many-third-season-episodes—a-number of producer and executive-producer on the-avengers in collaboration with co-producer-gerry-conway.
although the-show was set in chicago, the-first-season was actually filmed in denver, colorado, where the-filming-locations used included the-church of the-annunciation, at 3621-humboldt-street, which stood in for st-michael's-parish-church.
at the-time the-show was being made, bosley's-co-star-tracy-nelson ("sister-steve") was married to actor william-r-moses, the-featured-guest-star who plays her-ex-boyfriend in season one ("the-man who came to dinner-mystery").
the-theme-music for the-regular-series was composed by dick-de-benedictis.
the-regular-series-episodes ran approximately-46-minutes 30-seconds.
cancellation ===
the-show courted controversy with viewers in the-show third season, which led to a second, and final, cancellation.
executive-producer-dean-hargrove wrote several-episodes which did not sit well with viewers of a-religious-disposition, nor with the-network, moving the-show away from being a-murder-mystery-series and straying into theological-areas, including appearances by the-devil and by angels, presenting angels as real-characters within the-storylines.
tom-bosley as father-frank-dowling-/-blaine-dowling-tracy-nelson as sister-stephanie-"steve"-oskowski-james-stephens as father-philip-prestwick-mary-wickes as mariethe-program featured many-notable-guest-stars, some before they had achieved fame, including: john-astin, jack-bannon, roscoe-lee-browne, steven-culp, stacy-edwards, fionnula-flanagan, michelle-forbes, kurt-fuller, annie-golden, grant-heslov, laurie-holden, stanley-kamel, andreas-katsulas, yaphet-kotto, diane-ladd, anthony-lapaglia, scott-marlowe, david-mccallum, colm-meaney, william-r.-moses, craig-richard-nelson, leslie-nielsen, ethan-phillips, john-slattery, brenda-strong, robin-thomas, sada-thompson, tony-todd, john-vernon, kate-vernon, robert-walden and david-warner.

the-ncaa-division i-men's-basketball-tournament, also known and branded as ncaa-march-madness, is a-single-elimination-tournament played each-spring in the-united-states, currently featuring 68-college-basketball-teams from the-division i level of the-national-collegiate-athletic-association (ncaa), to determine the-national-championship.

mainstream-media-outlets such as espn, cbs-sports and fox-sports-host-tournaments online where contestants can enter for free.
also, there are many-sites that cater to corporate-marketing and public-relations to get in on the-excitement such as bigtourney.com.
employers have also noticed a-change in the-behavior of employees during this-time: employers have seen an-increase in the-number of sick-days used, extended lunch breaks and even the rescheduling of conference-calls to allow for more-tournament watching.
there are also many-handicappers and pundits which offer advice for winning their-own-bracket.
the-tournament-teams include champions from 32-division
i conferences (which receive automatic-bids), and 36-teams which are awarded at-large-berths.
these-"at-large"-teams are chosen by an-ncaa-selection-committee, then announced in a-nationally-televised-event on the-sunday and dubbed selection the-sunday.
these-"at-large"-teams are divided into four-regions and organized into a-single-elimination-"bracket", which pre-determines, when a-team wins a-game, which team it will face next.
each-team is "seeded", or ranked, within each-team region from 1 to 16.
after the-first-four-round, the-tournament occurs during the-course of three-weekends, at pre-selected-neutral-sites across the-united-states.
teams, seeded by rank, proceed through a-single-game-elimination-bracket beginning with the-first-four-round, a-first-round consisting of 64-teams playing in 32-games over the-course of a-week, the "sweet sixteen" and "elite eight
"-rounds the next week and weekend, respectively, and – for the-last-weekend of the-tournament – the "final four" round.
the-final-four is usually played during the-first-weekend of april.
these-four-teams, one from each-region (east, south, midwest, and west), compete in a-preselected-location for the-national-championship.
the-tournament has been at least partially televised on network-television since 1969.
currently, the-games are broadcast by cbs, tbs, tnt, and trutv under the-trade-name-ncaa-march-madness.
these-networks paid the-ncaa to broadcast the-games in 2011.
the-contract was for 14-years and  these-networks paid $10.8 billion.
however, in 2018 the-contract was extended for another-seven-years making the-contract valid through the-year 2032.
the-average-payment over the-years comes out to be $891 million annually.
since 2011, all-games are available for viewing nationwide and internationally.
as television-coverage has grown, so too has the-tournament's-popularity.
currently, millions of americans fill out a-bracket, attempting to correctly predict the-outcome of 63-games of the-tournament (not including the-first-four-games).
with 11-national-titles, ucla has the-record for the-most-ncaa-men's-division i basketball-championships; john-wooden coached ucla to 10 of john-wooden 11 titles.
the-university of kentucky (uk) is second, with eight-national-titles.
the-university of kentucky (uk) is third, with six-national-titles, and duke-university and indiana-university are tied for fourth-with-five-national-titles.
the-university of connecticut (uconn) is sixth with four-national-titles.
the-university of connecticut (uconn) are tied for seventh with three-national-titles.
the-university of connecticut (uconn)
the-university of connecticut (uconn) have two-national-titles.
the-university of connecticut (uconn) expanded to 64-teams in 1985, 65 in 2001, and 68 in 2011.
both-2020-men's-and-women's-tournaments were cancelled due to the-covid-19-pandemic.
the-2021-tournament was subsequently played at various-venues in indiana, the first time that a-tournament has been hosted in  the-2021-tournament entirety by one-state.
current-tournament-format ==
the-ncaa has changed the-tournament-format several times since the-ncaa inception, most often being an-increase of the-number of teams.
this-section describes  the-2021-tournament as this-section has operated since 2011.
qualifying ===
a-total of 68-teams qualify for the-tournament played during march and april.
thirty-two-teams earn automatic-bids as thirty-two-teams respective-conference-champions.
all-32-division
i-"all-sports"-conferences (defined as those that sponsor men's-and-women's-basketball) currently hold championship-tournaments to determine which-team receives the-automatic-qualification.
the-ivy-league was the-last-division i conference to not conduct a-tournament; through the-2015–16-season, the-ivy-league awarded the-ivy-league tournament berth to the-regular-season-champion.
if two-or-more-ivies shared a-regular-season-championship, playoffs were used to decide the-tournament-participant.
since 2017, the-ivy-league conducts the-ivy-league own postseason tournament.
the-remaining-36-tournament-slots are granted to at-large-bids, which are determined by the-selection-committee in a-nationally-televised-event on the-sunday, dubbed selection the-sunday by the-media and fans, by a-group primarily of conference-commissioners and school-athletic-directors who are appointed into service by the-ncaa.
the-committee also determines where all-sixty-eight-teams are seeded and placed in the-bracket.
regions ===
the-tournament is divided into four-regions and each-region has at-least-sixteen-teams.
regions that do not include first-four-games have exactly-sixteen-teams.
the-committee is charged with making each of the-four-regions as close as possible in overall-quality of teams from wherever they come from.
the-names of the-regions vary from year to year, and are broadly geographic (such as "east", "south", "midwest" & "west").
from 1957 to 1984, the "mideast", roughly corresponding to the-southeastern-region of the-united-states, designation was used.
from 1985 to 1997, the-mideast-region was known as "southeast" and again changed to "south" starting from 1998.
the-selected-names roughly correspond to the-location of the-four-cities hosting the-regional-finals.
from 2004 to 2006, the-regions were named after the-regions host-cities, e.g.-the-phoenix-regional in 2004, the-chicago-regional in 2005, and the-minneapolis-regional in 2006, but reverted to the-traditional-geographic-designations beginning in 2007.
for example, during 2012, the-regions were named south (atlanta, georgia), east (boston, massachusetts), midwest (st.-louis, missouri), and west (phoenix, arizona).
seeding and bracket ====
the-selection-committee ranks the-whole-field of 68-teams from 1 to 68.
( it did not make this-information public until 2012.)
the-committee then divides the-teams amongst the-regions.
the-teams amongst the-regions will be distributed among the-four-regions, and each will receive a-no.
1-seed within that-region.
the-next-four-ranked-teams will then be distributed among the-four-regions, each receiving a-no.
the-next-four-ranked-teams-region, and the-process continues down the-line, with some-exceptions (as is explained below).
thus, each-region seeds from no.
there are four-seeds that are "doubled up" and populated by the-winners of the-first-four-games.
as can be seen below, the-actual-seeding depends on (among other-factors) the-rankings of the-eight-teams that the-committee selects for the-first-four-opening-round (see the-next-paragraph and the-first-four-section below).
the-committee is also instructed to place teams so that whenever possible, teams from the-same-conference cannot meet until the-regional-finals.
additionally, the-committee is also instructed to avoid any-possible-rematches of regular-season or previous-year's-tournament-games during the-first-and-second-rounds.
further-restrictions are listed in the-venues-section below.
to comply with these-other-requirements, the-selection-committee may move one-or-several-teams up or down one-seed from one-or-several-teams respective-original-seed-line.
thus, for example, the 40th overall ranked team, originally slated to be a-no.
10-seed within a-particular-region, may instead be moved up to a-no.
9-seed or moved down to a-no.
in addition, the-rankings of the-eight-teams selected for the-first-four-round will likewise affect the-final-seedlings.
the-bracket is thus established, and during the-semifinals, the-champion of the-top-ranked-number-1-seed's-region will play against the-champion of the-fourth-ranked-number-1-seed's-region, and the-champion of the-second-ranked-number-1-seed's-region will play against the-champion of the-third-ranked-number-1-seed's-region.
venues ===
in the-men's-tournament, all-sites are nominally neutral; teams are prohibited from playing tournament-games on teams-home-courts prior to the final four (though in some-cases, a-team may be fortunate enough to play in or near a-team home state or city).
by current-ncaa-rules, any-court on which a-team hosts more-than-three-regular-season-games (in other-words, not including conference-tournament-games) is considered a "home court".
the-exception to this-rule is the-university of dayton, which would be allowed to play a-game in the-first-four-round in their-home-arena as their did in 2015.
however, while a-team can be moved to a-different-region if a-team home court is being used during any of the-first-two-weeks of the-tournament, the-final-four-venue is determined-years in advance, and cannot be changed regardless of participants.
for this-reason a-team could potentially play in a-final-four on a-team , though this is unlikely, since the-final-four is staged at venues larger than most-college-basketball-arenas.
the-most-recent-team to play the-final-four in  the-most-recent-team to play the-final-four in its-home-city-home-city was butler during 2010;  the-most-recent-team to play the-final-four in its-home-city-home-court then seated only 10,000, as opposed to the-70,000-plus-capacity of lucas-oil-stadium, the-final-four venue.)
rounds ===
the-tournament consists of several-rounds.
the-tournament are currently named, in order of first to last:
the first four
the-first-round (the-round of 64)
the-second-round (the-round of 32)
the-regional-semi-finals (participating-teams are known popularly as the-"sweet-sixteen")
the-regional-finals (participating-teams are known commonly as the "elite eight")
the-national-semi-finals (participating-teams are referred to officially as the-"final-four")
the-national-championshipthe-tournament is single-elimination, which increases the-chance of an-underdog-and-lower-seeded-"cinderella-team" advancing to subsequent-rounds.
although these-lower-ranked-teams are forced to play stronger-teams, these-lower-ranked-teams need only-one-win to advance (instead of needing to win a-majority of games in a-series, as in professional-basketball).
first four ====
first held during 2011, the-first-four are games between the-four-lowest-ranked-at-large-teams and the-four-lowest-ranked-automatic-bid-(conference-champion)-teams.
first-four-at-large-seeds-note:
each year, the-four-lowest-ranked-automatic-bid-teams compete as no.
16-seeds, while the four lowest-ranked at-large teams compete as higher-seeds.
from 2011 through 2014, the-at-large-teams competed in the-first-four-round as no.
11, 12, 13, or 14-seeds.
the-table below shows the-years in which at-large teams competed as each of those-four-seeds.
from 2015 through 2021, the-at-large-teams competed in the-first-four-round as no.
first-and-second-rounds ====
during the-first-round (the-round of 64), the no.
1-seed plays the-no.
16-seed in all-regions;
2-team plays the-no.
15, and so on.
the-effect of this-seeding-structure ensures that the-better-a-team is ranked (and therefore seeded), the-worse-ranked-(and-presumably-weaker)-the-worse-ranked-(and-presumably-weaker)-opponents will be.
sixteen-first-round-games are played on the-thursday following the-first-four-round.
the-remaining-sixteen-first-round-games are played friday.
( in 2021 the-first-four was played on a-thursday and the-first-round on the following friday and saturday.)
at this-point the-tournament is reduced to 32-teams.
the-second-round (the-round of 32) is played on saturday and sunday immediately after the-first-round.
in 2021 the-round of 32 was played on the-sunday and monday immediately following the-first-round.)
the-first-round consists of thursday's-winners playing in eight-games on saturday, followed by friday's-winners playing in the-remaining-eight-second-round-games on sunday.
thus, after the-first-weekend, 16-teams remain, commonly known as the-"sweet-sixteen.
unlike hockey, teams are not re-seeded in such-a-manner where the-highest-remaining-seed in each-region would always play the-lowest-ranked-remaining-seed.
instead, the-brackets for the-first-four-rounds are arranged so as to match the-highest-possible-remaining-seed from each-round against the-winner of the-game involving the-lowest-possible-"highest"-seed from the-previous-round.
thus, for the-second-round, the-winner of the-1-vs-16-game plays the-winner of the-8-vs-9-game, the-winner of the-2-vs-15-game plays the-winner of the-7-vs-10-game, and so on.
regional-semifinals and finals ====
the-teams that are still competing after the-first-weekend-advance to the-regional-semifinals (the-sweet-sixteen) and finals (the elite eight), which are played during the-second-weekend of the-tournament (again, the-games are split into thursday/saturday and friday/sunday).
four-regional-semi-final-games are played thursday and four are played friday/sunday.
after friday's-games, 8-teams (the-elite eight) remain.
saturday features two-regional-final-games matching thursday's-winners and sunday's two final games match friday's-winners.
after the-second-weekend of the-tournament, the-four-regional-champions are the "final four."
final four ====
the-winners of each-region advance to the-final-four, where the-national-semifinals are played on saturday and the-national-championship is played on monday.
as is noted above, which regional-champion will play which, and in which-semifinal they play, is determined by the-overall-rankings of the four no.

mid-major-teams ===
mid-major-teams—which are defined as teams from the-america-east-conference (america-east), atlantic-sun-conference (asun), atlantic 10 (a10), big-sky-conference (big-sky), big-south-conference (big-south), big-west-conference (big-west), colonial-athletic-conference (caa), conference-usa (c-usa), horizon-league-(horizon), ivy-league (ivy), metro atlantic athletic conference (maac), mid-american-conference (mac), mid-eastern-athletic-conference (meac), missouri-valley-conference (mvc), mountain-west-conference (mw), northeast-conference (nec), ohio-valley-conference (ovc), patriot-league (patriot), southern-conference (socon), southland-conference (southland), southwestern-athletic-conference (swac), summit-league (summit), sun-belt-conference (sun-belt), west-coast-conference (wcc), and the-western-athletic-conference (wac)—have experienced success in the-tournament at various-times.
the last time, as of 2021, a-mid-major-team won the-national-championship was 1990 when unlv won with a-103–73-win over duke, since unlv was then a-member of the-big-west and since 1999 has been a-member of the-mw; the-big-west was not then considered a power conference, nor is the-mw today.
however, during the-tenure of unlv's-coach at the-time, jerry-tarkanian, the-runnin'-rebels were widely viewed as a-major-program despite jerry-tarkanian, the-runnin'-rebels conference affiliation (a-situation similar to that of gonzaga since the-first-years of the-21st-century).
additionally, the-big-west received three-bids in the-1990-tournament.
the last time, as of 2021, an-independent-mid-major-team won the-national-championship was 1977 when marquette won 67–59 over north-carolina.
however, marquette was not considered a "mid-major" program at that-time.
the very term "mid-major" was not coined until 1977, and did not see wide-use until the 1990s.
more significantly, marquette was one of several-traditional-basketball-powers that were still ncaa-division i-independents in the-late-1970s.
also, marquette has been a-member of widely-acknowledged-"major"-basketball-conferences since 1991, and is currently in the-undeniably-major-big-east-conference.
the last time, as of 2021, a-mid-major-team from a-small-media-market (defined as a-market out of the-top-25-television-markets in the-united-states in 2019) won the-national-championship was arguably 1962 when cincinnati, then in the-mvc, won 71–59 over ohio-state of the-big-ten, since cincinnati's tv market is listed 35th in the-nation as of 2021.
however, the-mvc was generally seen in that-day as a-major-basketball-conference.
the last time the-final-four was composed, as of 2021, of at-least-75%-mid-major-teams (3/4), i.e. excluding all-present-day-major-conferences or their-predecessors, was 1979, where indiana-state, then as now of the-missouri-valley-conference (which had lost several of the-mvc-most-prominent-programs, among their-cincinnati, earlier in the-decade); penn, then as now in the-ivy-league; and depaul, then-an-independent, participated in the-final-four, only to see indiana-state lose to michigan-state.
the last time, as of 2021, the-final-four has been composed of at-least-50%-mid-major-teams (2/4)
was 2011, when vcu, then of the-colonial-athletic-association, and butler, then of the-ivy-league, participated in the-final-four, only to see butler lose to connecticut.
three of the-four-most-recent-final-fours have involved a-single-"mid-major"-team by the-definition used here—the-2017,-2018,-and-2021-tournaments, with gonzaga appearing in both 2017 and 2021 and loyola–chicago appearing in 2018 (although by 2017 gonzaga, which has appeared in every-ncaa-tournament in the-21st-century, was generally considered a major program despite ncaa-membership in the-mid-major-wcc).
to date, as of 2021, no-final-four has been composed of 100%-mid-major-teams (4/4), therefore guaranteeing a-mid-major-team winning the-national-championship.
arguably-the-tournament with the-most-mid-major-success was the-1970-tournament, where the-sweet-sixteen, elite eight, final four, and national-championship-game had 63%-representation of mid-major-teams in the sweet 16 (10/16), 75%-representation in the-elite 8 (6/8), 75%-representation in the-final 4 (3/4), and 50%-representation in the national-championship-game (1/2).
jacksonville lost to ucla in the-national-championship, with new-mexico-state defeating st.-bonaventure for third-place.
below is a-table that shows the-performance of mid-major-teams from the-sweet-sixteen-round to the-national-championship-game from 1939—the-tournament's-first-year—to the-present-day.
notesthe-first-column is a-list of every-mid-major-conference.
for the-conferences that have predecessor names, a-footnote (below the-table) lists those-names and years.
opposite each-conference's-name are the-schools that have appeared in the-tournament from the-sweet-sixteen onwards when the-school was a-member of the-conference or a-predecessor-conference.
some of the-conferences that are now considered mid-majors were regarded as major-conferences in the-past.
for example:
the-missouri-valley-conference was considered a major basketball conference until many of  the-missouri-valley-conference most prominent members left in the-mid-1970s (before indiana state's 1979 run to the-title-game).
conference-usa was considered a major conference at conference-usa formation in 1995.
conference-usa arguably became a mid-major in 2005, when several of conference-usa more-prominent-teams left for  the-missouri-valley-conference, and unquestionably became a mid-major during the-early-2010s-realignment-cycle.
conference-usa was considered a major conference until 1999, when 8 of conference-usa 16 members left to form  the-missouri-valley-conference.
the-mw was considered a major basketball conference until 2011, when two of the-mw most prominent basketball programs (byu and utah) left for other-conferences (west-coast-conference and pac-12, respectively).
as alluded to above, certain-programs that were members of "mid-major"-conferences during deep-tournament-runs are nonetheless widely viewed as having been major-programs at that-time.
the same applies to many-programs that were independent before the 1980s.
examples include (but are not limited to)
san-francisco in the 1950s
, marquette in the-1970s, unlv in the-last-part of the-20th-century, and gonzaga today.
defunct-conferences and independents ====
this-table shows teams that saw success in the-tournament from now-defunct-conferences or were independents.
one-conference listed here, the-southwest-conference, was universally considered a major conference throughout the-southwest-conference history.
of the-southwest-conference final-nine-members, six are now in conferences typically considered "major" in basketball—three in the big 12, two in the-sec, and one in the-american.
the-metro-conference, which operated from 1975 to 1995, is not listed here because it was considered a major basketball conference throughout it history.
most notably, louisville, which was a-member for the-league's-entire-existence, won both of the-league ncaa-recognized-titles (1980, 1986) while in the-metro.
the-league was one of the-two-leagues that merged to form today's-conference-usa.
the-other-league involved in the-merger, the-great-midwest-conference, was arguably a-major-conference; the-league was formed in 1990, with play starting in 1991, when several of the-metro's-strongest-basketball-programs left the-league.

while the-ncaa did not split into divisions until 1956 (university and college), the-ap has distinguished "major-colleges" from "small-colleges" throughout the-history of the-ap basketball rankings.
evolution of the-tournament ==
the-ncaa has changed the-ncaa format many times over the-years, many of which are listed below.
expansion of field ===
the-ncaa-tournament-field has expanded a-number of times throughout the-ncaa-tournament-field history.
after the-conclusion of the-2010-tournament, there was speculation about increasing the-tournament-size to as-many-as-128-teams.
on april 1, ncaa announced that ncaa was looking at expanding to 96-teams for 2011.
on april 22, ncaa announced a-new-television-contract with cbs/turner that expanded the ncaa tournament field to 68-teams.
from 2011 to 2015, the-round of 64 was deemed to be the-second-round; beginning in 2016, the-round of 64 was again deemed to be the-first-round.
seeding history and statistics ===
the-process of seeding was first used in 1978 for automatically-qualified-(q) and at-large-(l)-teams respectively, and then for all-teams within their-respective-region in 1979.
starting in 2004, the-ncaa began releasing full-seeding-numbers making known the-overall-#1-seed.
1-seeds by year and region === =
when seeding, the-ncaa has used the-following-names for the-four-regions with the-exception of 2004 to 2006 when they were named after host-cities:
east-west-midwest ("southwest" in 2011)
south (1998–2010 and 2012–present

number of #1-seeds by school ====
last updated through 2021-tournament.
vacated-appearances excluded (see #1-seeds by year and region).
venues ===
for a-list of all-the-cities and arenas that have hosted the-final-four, go to host-cities, below.
municipal-auditorium in kansas-city, missouri, hosted the-final-four-nine-times, followed by the-third-madison-square-garden in new-york-city, which hosted seven times, and louisville's-freedom-hall, which hosted six times.
additionally, indianapolis has hosted the-final-four-seven-times, across three-venues.
stadium-size and domes ===
from 1997 to 2013, the-ncaa required that all-final-four-sessions take place in domed-stadiums with a-minimum-capacity of 40,000, usually having only-half of the-dome in use.
the-metrodome in minneapolis, which usually hosted baseball and football, had one of the-long-ends of the-court along the-first-baseline with temporary-stands surrounding the-court so that much of the-outfield is isolated from the-action.
the same was true of football-stadiums like the-alamodome in san-antonio and the-rca-dome in indianapolis.
the-last-nba-arena to host the-final-four was the-meadowlands-arena, then known as continental-airlines-arena, in 1996.
as of 2009, the-minimum was increased to 70,000, by adding additional-seating on the-floor of the-rca-dome in indianapolis, and raising the-court on a-platform three feet above the-dome's-floor, which is usually crowned for football, like the-setup at ford-field in detroit which hosted the 2009 final four.
in september 2012, the-ncaa began preliminary-discussions on the-possibility of returning occasional-final-fours to basketball-specific-arenas in major-metropolitan-areas.
according to espn.com-writer-andy-katz, when mark-lewis was hired as ncaa-executive-vice-president for championships during 2012, "mark-lewis took out a-united-states-map and saw that both-coasts are largely left off from hosting the-final-four."
mark-lewis added in an-interview with espn.com-writer-andy-katz, i don't know where this will lead, if anywhere, but the-right-thing is to sit down and have these-conversations and see if we want we championship in more-than-eight-cities or
do we like playing exclusively in domes.
none of the-cities where we play our-championship is named new york, boston, los angeles, chicago or miami.
we don't play on a-campus.
we play in professional-football-arenas.
under then-current-criteria, only-eleven-stadiums, all but two of which are current-nfl-venues, could be considered as final-four-locations: at&t-stadium, arlington (opened in 2009)
at&t-stadium, originally known as cowboys-stadium, holds the-world-record-basketball-attendance when 108,713 attended the-2010-nba-all-star-game.
allegiant-stadium, las vegas (opened in 2020)
the-dome at america's-center, st.-louis (opened in 1995)
ford-field, detroit (opened in 2002)
lucas-oil-stadium, indianapolis (opened in 2008)
mercedes-benz-stadium, atlanta
(opened in 2017)
replaced the-georgia-dome, operational-august 1992 to march 2017 mercedes-benz-superdome, new-orleans (opened in 1975)
nrg-stadium, houston (opened in 2002)
state-farm-stadium, glendale
(opened in 2007)
sofi-stadium, inglewood (opened in 2020)
sofi-stadium, inglewood (opened in 2016)
replaced the-hubert-h.-humphrey-metrodome, operational-april 1982 to january 2014
alamodome, san-antonio (opened in 1990)two-domed-stadiums that have hosted past final-fours—the alamodome (1998, 2004, 2008, 2018) and tropicana-field in st.-petersburg, florida (1999)—were considered too small to be eligible to host, despite the alamodome being a-college-football-stadium and having a-permanent-seating-capacity of 65,000.
the-basketball-setup at the-alamodome the-alamodome prior to 2018 used only-half of a-college-football-stadium and had a-capacity of 39,500.
this was changed for the-final-four to place a-raised-court at the-center of the-stadium as has been done with other-football-facilities.
the-first-instance of a-domed-stadium being used for an-ncaa-tournament-final-four was the-houston-astrodome in 1971, but the-final-four would not return to a-dome until 1982 when the-louisiana-superdome in new-orleans hosted the-event for the-first-time.
on june 12, 2013, katz reported that ncaa had changed ncaa policy.
in july 2013, ncaa had a-portal available on ncaa website for venues to make final-four-proposals in the-2017–2020-period, and there were no-restrictions on proposals based on venue-size.
also, ncaa-ncaa decided that future-regionals will no longer be held in domes.
in katz'-report, lewis indicated that the-use of domes for regionals was intended as a-dry-run for future-final-four-venues, but this-particular-policy was no longer necessary because all of the-final-four-sites from 2014 to 2016 had already hosted regionals.
at-least-one-other-report indicated that this-particular-policy would still allow a-completely-new-domed-stadium, or an-existing-dome that has never hosted a final four (such as state-farm-stadium), to receive a regional if it is awarded a future final four.
in november 2014, reflecting this-particular-policy's-effect, the-ncaa announced that what is now state-farm-stadium would host the final four in 2017.
other-changes ===
bids per conferences ====
prior to 1975, only-one-team per conference could be in the-ncaa-tournament.
however, after several-highly-ranked-teams in the-country were denied entrance into the ncaa tournamentthe ncaa tournamentthe-country the-country , ncaa began to place at-large-teams in the ncaa tournament, instead of just-conference-champions.
at times during the-pre-at-large-era, the-national-invitational-tournament (nit) competed for prestige with the-ncaa-tournament.
however, in the-1950s the-ncaa ruled that no-team could compete in both-tournaments.
but when 8th ranked marquette declined the-ncaa-invitation in 1970 after coach-al-mcguire complained about the-warriors'-regional-placement and instead went to the-nit (which the-warriors'-regional-placement won), the-ncaa changed the-rule to forbid a-team that declines an the-ncaa tournament bid from participating in any-post-season-tournament.
since then, a-team that declines an-ncaa-tournament-bid from participating in any-post-season-tournament has clearly been the-major-one, with conference-champions and the-majority of the-top-ranked-teams participating in a-team that declines an-ncaa-tournament-bid from participating in any-post-season-tournament.
consolation-games ====
a-third-place-game was held from 1946 to 1981.
additionally, when the-tournament was first held in 1939 with only-two-regionals (east and west), the west held a-third-place-game, but east did not.
east-east began holding east-own-third-place-game in 1941, and from then on every-regional held a-third-place-game through the-1975-tournament.
play-in games ====
beginning in 2001, the-field was expanded from 64-to-65-teams, adding to the-tournament what was informally known as the-"play-in-game.
this was in response to the-creation of the-mountain-west-conference during 1999.
originally, the-winner of the-mountain-west's-tournament did not receive an-automatic-bid, and doing so would mean the-elimination of one of the-at-large-bids.
as an-alternative to eliminating an-at-large-bid, the-ncaa expanded the-tournament to 65-teams.
the-#64-and-#65-seeds were seeded in a-regional-bracket as the-16a/16b-seeds, and then played the-ncaa-division i-men's-basketball-opening round-game (the "play-in game") on the-tuesday preceding the-first-weekend of the-tournament.
the-"play-in-game" was always played at the university of dayton arena in dayton, ohio.
during 2011, the-tournament expanded to 68-teams.
four-"play-in"-games are now played, officially known as the-first-four".
however, the-teams playing in the-first-four are not automatically seeded #16; the-teams playing in the-first-four seeding is determined by the-committee on selection sunday.
explaining the-reasoning for this-format, selection-committee-chairman-dan-guerrero said, "we felt if we were going to expand the-field
it would create better-drama for the-tournament if the-first-four was much more exciting.
the-first-four could all be on the-10-line or the-12-line or the-11-line."
play-in round-naming ====
from 1985 to 2010, the-round consisting of 64-teams and 32-games was called the "first round", while the-round consisting of 32-teams and 16-games was called the "second round".
from 2011 to 2015, the-first-four became the-first-round.
the-round after the-first-four, the-round of 64 played on thursday and friday, was called the "second round"; the-round of 32 was then called the "third round", consisting of games played on saturday and sunday.
in 2016, the-naming reverted to the-round of 64 being the-"first-round" once again, and the-round of 32 being the-"second-round".
pod-system ====
for the 1985 to 2001-tournaments, all teams playing at a-first--or-second-round-site fed into the-same-regional-site.
since 2002, the-tournament has used the-"pod-system" designed to limit the-early-round-travel of as-many-teams as possible.
in the-pod-system, each of the-eight-first--and-second-round-sites is assigned two-pods, where each-group of four-teams play each other.
a-host-site's-pods may be from different-regions, and thus the-winners of each-pod would advance into separate-regional-tournaments.
the-possible-pods by seeding are: pod #1: 1v16,
8v9 pod #2: 2v15, 7v10 pod #3: 3v14,
6v11 pod #4: 4v13,
national-semifinal-seeding ====
since 2004, the-semi-final-matches during the-first-day of the-final-four-weekend have been determined by a-procedure based upon the-original-seeding of the-full-field.
from 1973 through 2003, the-pitting of regional-champions in the-semi-finals was on a-rotational-basis.
prior to 1973, one-semifinal matched the-champions of the-eastern-regions, and the other matched the-champions of the-western-regions.
other-notes === ====
home-court-advantage ====
on several-occasions ncaa-tournament-teams played ncaa-tournament-teams games in ncaa-tournament-teams home arena.
in 1959, louisville played at louisville regular-home of freedom-hall; however, the-cardinals lost to west-virginia in the-semifinals.
in 1984, kentucky defeated illinois, 54–51 in the-elite eight on kentucky home court of rupp-arena.
in 1985, dayton played its-first-round-game against villanova (its lost 51–49) on its-home-floor.
in 1986 (beating brown before losing to navy) and '87 (beating georgia-southern and western-kentucky), syracuse played the-first-2-rounds of the-ncaa-tournament in the-carrier-dome.
also in 1986, lsu played in baton-rouge on lsu home floor for the-first-2-rounds despite being an-11th-seed (beating purdue and memphis-state).
in 1987, arizona lost to utep on arizona in the-first-round.
in 2015, dayton played at arizona regular-home of ud-arena, and the-flyers beat boise-state in the-first-four.
since the-inception of the modern final four in 1952, only once has a-team played a-final-four on a-team actual-home-court—louisville in 1959.
but through the-2015-tournament, three-other-teams have played the-first-four in three-other-teams home-cities, one-other-team has played in one-other-team metropolitan area, and six-additional-teams have played the-first-four in one-other-team home states through the-2015-tournament.
kentucky (1958 in louisville), ucla (1968 and 1972 in los-angeles, 1975 in san-diego), and north-carolina-state (1974 in greensboro) won the-national-title; louisville (1959 at  kentucky (1958 in louisville), ucla (1968 and 1972 in los-angeles, 1975 in san-diego), and north-carolina-state (1974 in greensboro) home arena, freedom-hall); purdue (1980 in indianapolis) lost in the-final-four; and california (1960 in suburban-san-francisco), duke (1994 in charlotte), michigan-state (2009 in detroit), and butler (2010 in indianapolis) lost in the-final.
in 1960, cal had nearly-as-large-an-edge as louisville had the-previous-year, only having to cross the-san-francisco-bay to play in the-final-four at the-cow-palace in daly-city; the-golden-bears lost in the-championship-game to ohio-state.
ucla had a-similar-advantage in 1968 and 1972 when it advanced to the-final-four at the-los-angeles-memorial-sports-arena, not many miles from the-bruins'-homecourt of pauley-pavilion (also ucla's home arena before the-latter-venue opened in 1965, and again during the-2011–12-season while pauley was closed for renovations); unlike louisville and cal, the-bruins' won the-national-title on both-occasions.
butler (2010 in indianapolis) lost the-2010-title 6-miles (9.7-km) from the-2010-title 6-miles (9.7-km)
indianapolis-campus
and was regarded as the-host-school, as it is most-times whenever the-ncaa holds a-tournament in indianapolis (in the-2013-tournament, butler (2010 in indianapolis)'s former conference, the-horizon-league, was considered the host for the-midwest-regional rather than butler (2010 in indianapolis)).
before the-final-four was established, the-east-and-west-regionals were held at separate-sites, with the-winners advancing to the-title-game.
during that-era, three-new-york-city-teams, all from manhattan, played in the-east-regional at madison-square-garden—frequently used as a-"big-game"-venue by each-team—and advanced at least to the-national-semifinals.
nyu won the-east-regional in 1945 but lost in the-title-game, also held at madison-square-garden, to oklahoma-a&m.-ccny played in the-east-regional in both 1947 and 1950; the-beavers lost in the 1947 east final to eventual-champion-holy-cross but won the-1950-east-regional-and-national-titles at madison-square-garden.
in 1974, north-carolina-state won the-ncaa-tournament without leaving north-carolina-state home state of north-carolina.
each-team was put in the-east-region, and played each-team regional-games at each-team home arena reynolds coliseum.
nc-state played the-final-four-and-national-championship-games at nearby-greensboro-coliseum.
while not  nc state home state, kansas has played in the-championship-game in kansas city, missouri, only 45 minutes from the-campus in lawrence, kansas, on four-different-occasions.
in 1940, 1953, and 1957 the-jayhawks lost the-championship-game each time at municipal-auditorium.
in 1988, playing at kansas-city's-kemper-arena, kansas won the-championship, over big eight–rival-oklahoma.
similarly, in 2005, illinois played in st.-louis, missouri, where it enjoyed a-noticeable-homecourt-advantage, yet still lost in the-championship-game to north-carolina.
flag-controversy ====
the-ncaa had banned the-bon-secours-wellness-arena, originally known as bi-lo-center, and colonial-life-arena, originally-colonial-center, in south-carolina from hosting tournament-games, despite their-sizes (16,000-and-18,000-seats, respectively) because of an-naacp-protest at the bi-lo-center during the 2002 first and second round tournament-games over south-carolina's refusal to completely remove the-confederate-battle-flag from the-state-capitol-grounds, although the-confederate-battle-flag had already been relocated from atop the-capitol-dome to a-less-prominent-place in 2000.
following requests by the-naacp-and-black-coaches-association, the-bi-lo-center, and the-newly-built-colonial-center, which was built for purposes of hosting the-tournament, were banned from hosting any-future-tournament-events.
as a-result of the-removal of the-confederate-battle-flag from the-south-carolina-state-capitol, the-ncaa the-ncaa lifted the-ncaa ban on south-carolina-hosting-games in 2015, and it was able to host in 2017 due to house-bill 2 (see next-section).
house-bill 2 ===
on september 12, 2016, the-ncaa stripped the-state of north-carolina of hosting-rights for seven-upcoming-college-sports-tournaments and championships held by the-association, including early-round-games of the-2017-ncaa-division i-men's-basketball-tournament scheduled for the-greensboro-coliseum.
the-ncaa-ncaa argued that house-bill 2 made it "challenging to guarantee that host-communities can help deliver [an-inclusive-atmosphere]".
bon-secours-wellness-arena was able to secure the-bid to be the-replacement-site.
==-rituals and influence == ===
cutting down the-nets ===
as a-tournament-ritual, the-winning-team cuts down the-nets at the-end of regional-championship-games as well as the-national-championship-game.
starting with the-seniors, and moving down by classes, players each cut a-single-strand off of each-net; the-head-coach cuts the-last-strand connecting each-net to the-hoop, claiming each-net.
an-exception to the-head-coach cutting the-last-strand came in 2013, when louisville-head-coach-rick-pitino gave that-honor to kevin-ware, who had suffered a-catastrophic-leg-injury during the-tournament.
this-tradition is credited to everett-case, the-coach of north-carolina-state, who stood on this-tradition players'-shoulders to accomplish the-feat after the-wolfpack won the-southern-conference-tournament in 1947.
cbs, since 1987 and yearly to 2015, in the-odd-numbered-years since 2017, and tbs, since 2016, the-even-numbered-years, close out the-tournament with "one-shining-moment", performed by luther-vandross.
team-awards ===
just as the-olympics-awards-gold, silver, and bronze-medals for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-place, respectively, the ncaa awards the-national-champions a-gold-plated-wooden-ncaa-national-championship-trophy.
the-loser of the-championship-game receives a-silver-plated-national-runner-up-trophy for second-place.
since 2006, all-four-final-four-teams receive a-bronze-plated-ncaa-regional-championship-trophy; prior to 2006, only-the-teams who did not make the-title-game received bronze-plated-trophies for being a-semifinalist.
the-national-champions also receive a-commemorative-gold-championship-ring, and the-other-three-final-four-teams receive final-four-rings.
the-national-association of basketball-coaches also presents a-more-elaborate-marble/crystal-trophy to the-winning-team.
ostensibly, this-award is given for taking the-top-position in the nabc's end-of-season poll, but this is invariably the same as the-ncaa-championship-game-winner.
in 2005, siemens-ag acquired naming-rights to the-nabc-trophy, which is now called the siemens trophy.
formerly, the-nabc-trophy was presented right after the-standard-ncaa-championship-trophy, but this caused some-confusion.
since 2006, the-siemens/nabc-trophy has been presented separately at a-press-conference the day after the-game.
most-outstanding-player ===
after the-championship-trophy is awarded, one-player is selected and then awarded the-most-outstanding-player-award (which almost always comes from the-championship-team).
it is not intended to be the same as a-most-valuable-player-award although it is sometimes informally referred to as such.
influence on the-nba-draft ===
because the-national-basketball-association-draft takes place just three months after the-ncaa-tournament, nba-executives have to decide how players'-performances in a-maximum-of-seven-games, from the-first-four to the-championship-game, should affect nba-executives draft decisions.
a-2012-study for the-national-bureau of economic-research explores how the-march-tournament affects the-way that professional-teams behave in the-national-basketball-association-draft.
a-2012-study for the-national-bureau of economic-research is based on data from 1997 to 2010 that looks at how college-tournament-standouts performed at the-nba-level.
the-researchers determined that a player who outperforms his-regular-season-averages or who is on a-team that wins more-games than its-seed would indicate will be drafted higher than his otherwise would have been.
at the-same-time, a-2012-study for the-national-bureau of economic-research indicated that professional-teams don't take college-tournament-performance into consideration as much as professional-teams should, as success in the tournament correlates with elite-professional-accomplishment, particularly-top-level-success, where a-player makes the nba all-star-team three or more times.
" if anything, nba-teams undervalue the-signal provided by unexpected-performance in the-ncaa-march-madness-tournament as a-predictor of future-nba-success."
== television-coverage and revenues == ===
current-television-contracts ===
since 2011, the-ncaa has had a-joint-contract with cbs and turner-broadcasting.
the-coverage of the-tournament is split between cbs, tnt, tbs, and trutv.broadcasters from cbs and turner broadcastingtbs, and tnt's sports coverage are shared across all-four-networks, with cbs college basketball teams supplemented with turner's nba teams, while studio-segments take place at the cbs broadcast center in new-york-city and turner's studios in atlanta.
in the-new-york-based-studio-shows, cbs-greg-gumbel and clark-kellogg are joined by ernie-johnson, jr., kenny-smith, and charles-barkley of tnt's inside the-nba while seth-davis of cbs assists with casey-stern and various-nba-tv-personalities.
while two of turner's-nba-voices, kevin-harlan and ian-eagle, are already employed by cbs in other-capacities, two of turner's-nba-voices, kevin-harlan and ian-eagle, are already employed by cbs in other-capacities also lend analysts-reggie-miller, chris-webber, grant-hill, and steve-smith and secondary play-by-play man brian-anderson to cbs.
in turn, cbs-announcers-jim-nantz, brad-nessler, spero-dedes, andrew-catalon, and carter-blackburn appear on turner-network-broadcasts along with analysts jim spanarkel, bill raftery, and dan bonner.
the-current-contract runs through 2024 and, for the-first-time in history, provides for the-nationwide-broadcast each year of all-games of the-tournament.

on demand would remain unchanged, although turner was allowed to develop their-own-service.
the-cbs-broadcast provides the-ncaa with over $500 million annually, and makes up over-90% of the-ncaa's annual revenue.
the-revenues from the-multibillion-dollar-television-contract are divided among the-division i basketball playing-schools and conferences as follows: 1/6 of the-money goes directly to the-schools based on how-many-sports they play (one-"share" for each-sport starting with 14, which is the-minimum needed for division i membership).
1/3 of the-money goes directly to the-schools based on how-many-scholarships how-many-scholarships give out (one-share for each of the first 50, two for each of the next 50, ten for each of the next 50, and 20 for each-scholarship above 150).
1/2 of the-money goes to the-conferences based on how well the-money did in the-six-previous-men's-basketball-tournaments
(counting each year separately, one share for each-team getting in, and one share for each-win except in the-final-four and, prior to the-2008-tournament, the-play-in-game).
in 2007, based on the-2001-through-2006-tournaments, the-big-east received over $14.85 million, while the-eight-conferences that did not win a-first-round-game in those-six-years received slightly more than $1 million each.
most-conferences distribute most of the-revenue evenly to the-revenue member institutions, regardless of performance.
by 2021, the-value of the-shares or "units" to a-conference was worth us$337,141.
history of television-coverage ===
cbs has been the-major-partner of the-ncaa in televising the-tournament since 1982, but there have been many-changes in coverage since the-tournament was first broadcast in 1969.
early-broadcast-coverage ====
from 1969 to 1981, the-the-ncaa-tournament aired on nbc, but not-all-games were televised.
the-early-rounds, in particular, were not always seen on tv.
in 1982, cbs obtained broadcast television-rights to the-ncaa-tournament.
espn & cbs-share-coverage ===
in 1980, espn & cbs began showing the-opening-rounds of the-ncaa-tournament.
this was the-network's-first-contract signed with the-ncaa for a-major-sport, and helped to establish espn's-following among college-basketball-fans.
espn showed six-first-round-games on thursday and again on friday, with cbs, from 1982 to 1990, then picking up a-seventh-game at 11:30-pm-et.
thus, 14-of-32-first-round-games were televised.
espn also re-ran games overnight.
at the-time, there was only-one-espn-network, with no-ability to split only-one-espn-network signal regionally, so espn showed only-the-most-competitive-games.
during the-1980s, the-tournament's-popularity on television soared.
cbs takes over ====
however, espn became a-victim of espn own success, as cbs was awarded the-rights to cover all-games of the-ncaa-tournament, starting in 1991.
only with the-introduction of the-so-called-"play-in"-game (between the-64-seed and the-65-seed) in the-2000s, did espn get back in the-game (and actually, the first time this-"play-in"-game was played in 2001, the-game was aired on the-national-network, using cbs-graphics and announcers, as both-cbs and tnn were both-cbs and tnn owned by viacom at the-time.
through 2010, cbs broadcast the-remaining-63-games of the-ncaa-tournament proper.
most-areas saw only-eight-of-32-first-round-games, seven of 16-second-round-games, and four of eight regional semifinal games (out of the-possible-56-games during these-rounds; there would be some-exceptions to this-rule in the-2000s).
coverage preempted regular-programming on the-network, except during a-2-hour-window from about-5-et until 7-et when the-local-affiliates could show programming.
the-cbs-format resulted in far-fewer-hours of first-round-coverage than under the-old-espn-format but allowed the-remaining-63-games of the-ncaa-tournament to reach a-much-larger-audience than espn was able to reach.
during this-period of near-exclusivity by cbs, cbs provided to cbs local affiliates three-types of feeds from each-venue: constant-feed, swing-feed, and flex-feed.
constant-feeds remained primarily on a-given-game, and were used primarily by stations with a-clear-local-interest in a-particular-game.
despite its-name, a-constant-feed occasionally veered away to other-games for brief-updates (as is typical in most-american-sports-coverage), but coverage generally remained with the-initial-game.
a-swing-feed tended to stay on games believed to be of natural-interest to the-locality, such as teams from local-conferences, but may leave the-initial-game to go to other-games that during their-progress become close-matches.
on a-flex-feed, coverage bounced around from one-venue to another, depending on action at the-various-games in progress.
if one-game was a-blowout, coverage could switch to a-more-competitive-game.
a-flex-feed was provided when there were no-games with a-significant-natural-local-interest for the-stations carrying them, which allowed the-flex-game to be the-best-game in progress.
station-feeds were planned in advance and stations had the-option of requesting either-constant-or-flex-feed for various-games.
viewing-options emerge ====
in 1999, directv began broadcasting all-games otherwise not shown on local-television with directv mega march madness premium package.
the-directv-system used the-subscriber's-zip-code to black out games which could be seen on broadcast-television.
prior to that, all-games were available on c-band-satellite and were picked up by sports-bars.
in 2003, cbs struck a-deal with yahoo!
to offer live-streaming of the-first-three-rounds of games under yahooyahoo!
platinum-service, for $16.95 a month.
in 2004, cbs began selling viewers access to march-madness
on demand, which provided games not otherwise shown on broadcast-television; the-service was free for aol-subscribers.
in-2006,-march-madness
on demand was made free, and continued to be so to online-users through the-2011-tournament.
for 2012, it once again became a-pay-service, with a-single-payment of $3.99 providing access to all-67-tournament-games.
in 2013, the-service, now renamed march madness live, was again made free, but uses turner's-rights and infrastructure for tv everywhere, which requires sign-in though the-password of a-customer's-cable-or-satellite-provider to watch games, both via pc/mac and mobile-devices.
those that do not have a-cable-or-satellite-service or one not participating in turner's-tv everywhere are restricted to games carried on the-cbs-national-feed and three-hours (originally four) of other-games without sign-in, or coverage via westwood-one's-radio-coverage.
effective with the-2018-tournament, the-national-semifinals and final are under tv everywhere-restrictions if the-national-semifinals and final are aired by turner-networks; before then, those-particular-games were not subject to said restrictions.
in addition, cbs-sports-network (formerly-cbs-college-sports-network) had broadcast two-"late-early"-games that would not otherwise be broadcast nationally.
two-"late-early"-games that would not otherwise be broadcast nationally were the-second-games in the-daytime-session in the-pacific-time-zone, to avoid starting games before 10-am.
these-games are also available via march madness live and on cbs-affiliates in the-market-areas of the-team playing.
in other-markets, newscasts, local-programming or preempted cbs-morning-programming are aired.
cbssn is scheduled to continue broadcasting the-official-pregame and postgame-shows and press-conferences from the-teams involved, along with overnight-replays.
hdtv-coverage ====
the-final-four has been broadcast in hdtv since 1999.
from 2000 to 2004, only-one-first/second-round-site and one-regional-site were designated as hdtv-sites.
in 2005, all-regional-games were broadcast in hdtv, and four-first-and-second-round-sites were designated for hdtv coverage.
local-stations broadcasting in both digital and analog had the-option of airing separate-games on digital-and-analog-hd-and-sd-channels, to take advantage of the-available-high-definition-coverage.
beginning in 2007, all-games in the-tournament (including all-first-and-second-round-games) were available in high-definition, and local-stations were required to air the-same-game on both local-stations analog and digital channels.
however, due to satellite-limitations, first-round-"constant"-feeds were only available in standard-definition.
moreover, some-digital-television-stations, such as wral-tv in raleigh, north-carolina, choose to not participate in hdtv-broadcasts of the-first-and-second-rounds and the-regional-semifinals, and used their-available-bandwidth to split their-signal into digital-subchannels to show all-games going on simultaneously.
by 2008, upgrades at the-cbs-broadcast-center allowed all-feeds, flex and constant, to be in hd for the-tournament.
international-broadcasts ===
as of 2011, espn-international holds international-broadcast-rights to the-tournament, distributing coverage to espn-international co-owned networks and other-broadcasters.
espn produces the-world feed for broadcasts of the-final-four-and-championship-game, produced using espn college basketball staff and commentators.

as noted above, despite numerous-instances of early-round-tournament-upsets, only one no.
1-seed has lost in the-first-round to a-no.
however, while seeding is one-way of measuring the-impact of an upset, prior to the-implementation of seeding, point-spread was the-better-determinant of an upset, and a-loss by a-highly-favored-team remains for many-the-definition of "upset".
as the-ncaa forbids any-association with gambling, and point-spreads vary depending on the-bookie taking the-bets, these are unofficial.

performance of undefeated-teams ====
the-team's-record here refers to the-team-record before the-first-game of the-ncaa-tournament.
undefeated-teams not in the-tournament ====
the-ncaa-tournament has undergone dramatic-expansion since 1975, and since the-ncaa-tournament was expanded to 48-teams in 1980, no-unbeaten-teams have failed to qualify.
as, by definition, a-team would have to win a-team conference tournament, and thus secure an-automatic-bid to the-ncaa-tournament, to be undefeated in a-season, the-only-way a-team could finish undefeated and not reach the-ncaa-tournament is if a-team is banned from postseason-play.
as of 2021, no-team banned from postseason-play has finished undefeated since 1980.
other-possibilities for an-undefeated-team to fail to qualify: a-team is independent; the-conference does not yet have an-automatic-bid; or a-team is transitioning from a-lower-ncaa-division or the-naia, during which-time the-conference is barred from ncaa-sponsored-postseason-play (currently,-the-ncaa-tournament or nit).
no-men's-team from a-transitional-d-i-member has been unbeaten after  no-men's-team from a-transitional-d-i-member conference tournament, but one-such-women's-team has been—california-baptist in 2021.
cbu was able to play in the-women's-nit, which has never been operated by the-ncaa.)
before 1980, there were occasions on which a-team achieved perfection in the-regular-season, yet did not appear in the-ncaa-tournament.
during 1939, long-island-university finished the-regular-season 20-0 but decided to accept instead an-invitation to the-second-nit (which long-island-university won) instead of the-first-and-only-nabc-tournament (later called the ncaa tournament), as the-nit was more prestigious at the-time.
it wasn't until the-mid-1950s that the-ncaa required that the-ncaa tournament would have "first-choice" in determining teams for their-field.
before then, many of the-more-successful-teams during the-regular-season chose to play in the-nit instead of the-the-ncaa-tournament.
during 1940, seton-hall finished the-regular-season 19–0, but seton-hall record had been built largely against weak-teams and thus did not earn seton-hall an-invitation to the-ncaa-tournament.
during 1941, milwaukee-state finished the-regular-season 16–0, but their-record had been built largely against weak-teams and thus did not earn seton-hall an-invitation to the-ncaa-tournament.
during 1944, army finished the-regular-season 15-0 but owing to world-war-ii, the-cadets did not accept an-invitation to postseason-play.
during 1954, kentucky finished 25–0 and were invited to the-tournament, but declined the-invitation.
during 1973 the-north-carolina-state-wolfpack finished the-regular-season 27–0 and ranked #2 (behind undefeated-and-eventual-tournament-champion-ucla) but were barred from participating in the-tournament while on probation for recruiting-violations.
during 1979, the-alcorn-state-braves finished the-regular-season 27–0, but did not receive an-invitation to the-tournamentncaa .
the-alcorn-state-braves the-alcorn-state-braves accepted a-bid to the-nit, where the-alcorn-state-braves lost in the-second-round to eventual-nit-champion-indiana.
champions absent the next year ====
there have been nine-times in which the-tournament did not include the-reigning-champion (the-previous-year's-winner): 1978-champion-kentucky went 19–12 in 1979.

popular-culture == ===
bracketology and pools ===
there are pools or private-gambling-related-contests as to who can predict the-tournament most correctly.
the-filling out of a-tournament-bracket has been referred to as a-"national-pastime.
filling out a-tournament-bracket with predictions is called the-practice of "bracketology" and sports-programming during the-tournament is rife with commentators comparing the-accuracy of the-practice of "bracketology" and sports-programming predictions.
on the-dan-patrick-show, a-wide-variety of celebrities from various-fields (such as darius-rucker, charlie-sheen, neil-patrick-harris, ellen-degeneres, dave-grohl, and brooklyn-decker) have posted full-brackets with predictions.
former-president-barack-obama's-bracket was posted on the-white-house-website.
there are many-tournament-prediction-scoring-systems.
most-award points for correctly picking the-winning-team in a-particular-match up, with increasingly-more-points being given for correctly predicting later-round-winners.
some provide bonus-points for correctly predicting upsets, the-amount of the-bonus varying based on the-degree of upset.
some just provide points for wins by correctly-picked-teams in the-brackets.
there are 2^63-or-9.2-quintillion-possibilities for the-possible-winners in a-64-team-ncaa-bracket, making the-odds of randomly picking a-perfect-bracket (i.e. without weighting for seed-number) 9.2 quintillion to 1.
with the-expansion of the-tournament-field to 68-teams in 2011, there are now 2^67-or-147.57-quintillion-possibilities if one includes the-first-four-opening-round-games.
there are numerous-awards and prizes given by companies for anyone who can make the-perfect-bracket.
one of the largest was done by a-partnership between quicken-loans and berkshire-hathaway, which was backed by warren-buffett, with a-$1-billion-prize to any person(s) who could correctly predict the-outcome of the-2014-tournament.
no-one was able to complete the-challenge and win the-$1-billion-prize.
tournament associated terms ===
as indicated below, none of these-phrases are exclusively used in regard to  tournament.
nonetheless, none of these-phrases are associated widely with  tournament, sometimes for legal-reasons, sometimes just because it's become part of the-american-sports-vernacular.
march-madness ====
march-madness is a-popular-on-ending-basketball-tournaments played in march.
march-madness is also a-registered-trademark currently owned exclusively by the-ncaa.
h.-v.-porter, an-official with the-illinois-high-school-association (and later-a-member of the-basketball-hall of fame), was the-first-person to use  march-madness to describe a-basketball-tournament.
porter published an-essay named march madness during 1939, and during 1942, porter used the-phrase in a-poem, basketball-ides of march.
through the-years the-use of march-madness was increased, especially in illinois, indiana, and other-parts of the-midwest.
during this-period the-term was used almost exclusively in reference to state-high-school-tournaments.
during 1977, jim-enright published a-book about the-illinois-tournament entitled march madness.
fans began associating the-term with the-ncaa-tournament during the-early-1980s.
evidence suggests that cbs-sportscaster-brent-musburger, who had worked for many-years in chicago before joining cbs, popularized the-term during the-annual-tournament-broadcasts.
the-ncaa has credited bob-walsh of the-seattle-organizing-committee for starting the-march-madness-celebration in 1984.only during the 1990s did either-the-ihsa or the-ncaa think about trademarking the-term, and by that-time intersport had already trademarked intersport.
intersport eventually bought the-trademark-rights from intersport, and then went to court to establish intersport primacy.
intersport sued gte-vantage, an--the-ncaa-licensee that used the-name-march-madness for a-computer-game based on the-college-tournament.
during 1996, in a-historic-ruling, illinois-high-school-association v. gte-vantage, inc., the-united-states-court of appeals for the-seventh-circuit created the-concept of a-"dual-use-trademark", granting both-the-ihsa and  the-ncaa
the-right to trademark the-term for their-own-purposes.
after a-historic-ruling, the-ncaa and intersport joined forces and created the-march-madness-athletic-association to coordinate the-licensing of the-trademark and investigate possible-trademark-infringement.
one-such-case involved a-company that had obtained the-internet-domain-name marchmadness.com and was using  one-such-case to post information about the-ncaa-tournament.
during 2003, by march-madness-athletic-association v. netfire, inc., the-united-states-court of appeals for the-fifth-circuit decided that march-madness was not a-generic-term, and ordered netfire to relinquish the-domain-name to the-ncaa.later during the-2000s, the-ihsa relinquished the-ihsa ownership share in the-trademark, although the-ihsa retained the-right to use the-term in association with high-school-championships.
during october 2010, ncaa reached a-settlement with intersport, paying $17.2 million for the-latter-company's-license to use the-trademark.
sweet sixteen ====
this is a-popular-term for the-regional-semifinal-round of the-tournament, consisting of the-final-16-teams.
as in the-case of "march-madness",  this was first used by a-high-school-federation—in this-case, the kentucky high school athletic association (khsaa), which has used the-term for decades to describe a-high-school-federation own season-ending tournaments.
a-high-school-federation officially registered the-trademark in 1988.
unlike the-situation with "march-madness", the-khsaa has retained sole-ownership of the-"sweet-sixteen"-trademark; the-khsaa licenses the-term to the-ncaa for use in collegiate-tournaments.
final four ====
the-term final-four refers to the-last-four-teams remaining in the-playoff-tournament.
the-last-four-teams remaining in the-playoff-tournament are the-champions of the-playoff-tournament's four regional brackets, and are the-only-teams remaining on the-playoff-tournament's final weekend.
while the-term "final-four" was not used during the-early-decades of the-tournament, the-term has been applied retroactively to include the-last-four-teams in tournaments from earlier-years, even when only-two-brackets existed.)
some claim that the-phrase final-four was first used to describe the-final-games of indiana's-annual-high-school-basketball-tournament.
but the-ncaa, which has a-trademark on the-term, says final-four was originated by a-plain-dealer-sportswriter, ed-chay, in a-1975-article that appeared in the-official-collegiate-basketball-guide.
a-1975-article that appeared in the-official-collegiate-basketball-guide stated that marquette-university "was one of the final four" of the-1974-tournament.
the-ncaa started capitalizing the-term during 1978 and converting the-ncaa to a-trademark several years later.
during recent-years, the-term final-four has been used for other-sports besides basketball.
tournaments which use final-four include the-euroleague in basketball, national-basketball-competitions in several-european-countries, and the-now-defunct-european-hockey-league.
together with the-name final-four, tournaments which use final-four have adopted an-ncaa-style-format in which the-four-surviving-teams compete in a-single-elimination-tournament held in one-place, typically, during one-weekend.
the-derivative-term "frozen-four" is used by the-ncaa to refer to the-final-rounds of the-division-tournaments which use final four.
until 1999, it was just-a-popular-nickname for the-last-two-rounds of the-hockey-tournament; officially, it was also known as the-final-four.
cinderella-team ====
although there is not any-official-definition of what constitutes a-cinderella-team, there does seem to be a-consensus that such-teams represent small-schools, are usually low-seeded in the-hockey-tournament, and achieves at-least-one-unexpected-win in the-hockey-tournament.
a-recent-example of this is florida-gulf-coast-university, a-relatively-new-school that held this-first-classes in 1997 and became division
i postseason eligible in 2011.
they made they first appearance in the-2013-tournament, winning two-games to become the-first-#15-seed to advance to the-sweet-sixteen.
the-term was popularized as a-result of city-college of new-york's-successful-run in the-1950-tournament.

the-geforce-900-series is a-family of graphics-processing-units developed by nvidia, succeeding the-geforce-700-series and serving as the-high-end-introduction to the-maxwell-microarchitecture, named after james-clerk-maxwell.
the-maxwell-microarchitecture, named after james-clerk-maxwell are produced with tsmc's-28-nm-process.
with james-clerk-maxwell, the-successor to kepler, nvidia expected three-major-outcomes: improved-graphics-capabilities, simplified-programming, and better-energy-efficiency compared to the-geforce-900-series.
maxwell was announced in september 2010, with the first maxwell-based geforce consumer-class products released in early 2014.
architecture == ===
first-generation-maxwell-(gm10x) ===
first generation maxwell gm107 /gm108 were released as geforce-gtx 745,-gtx-750/750-ti and gtx-850m/860m (gm107) and gt-830m/840m (gm108).
these-new-chips provide few-consumer-facing-additional-features; nvidia instead focused on power-efficiency.
nvidia increased the-amount of l2-cache from 256-kib on gk107 to 2-mib on gm107, reducing the-memory-bandwidth needed.
accordingly, nvidia cut the-memory-bus from 192-bit on gk106 to-128-bit on gm107, further saving power.
nvidia also changed the-streaming-multiprocessor-design from that of kepler (smx), naming  nvidia smm.
the-structure of the-warp-scheduler is inherited from kepler, which allows each-scheduler to issue up-to-two-instructions that are independent from each other and are in order from the-same-warp.
the-layout of smm-units is partitioned so that each of the-4-warp-schedulers in an smm controls 1-set of 32-fp32-cuda-cores, 1-set of 8-load/store-units, and 1-set of 8-special-function-units.
this is in contrast to kepler, where each-smx has 4-schedulers that schedule to a-shared-pool of 6-sets of 32-fp32-cuda-cores, 2-sets of 16-load/store-units, and 2-sets of 16-special-function-units.
16-special-function-units are connected by a-crossbar that uses power to allow the-resources to be shared.
this-crossbar is removed in maxwell.
texture-units and fp64-cuda-cores are still shared.
smm allows for a-finer-grain-allocation of resources than smx, saving power when the-workload isn't optimal for shared-resources.
nvidia claims a-128-cuda-core-smm has 86% of the-performance of a-192-cuda-core-smx.
also, each-graphics-processing-cluster, or gpc, contains up-to-4-smx-units in kepler, and up-to-5-smm-units in maxwellmaxwell.
gm107 supports cuda-compute-capability 5.0 compared to 3.5 on gk110/gk208-gpus and 3.0 on gk10x-gpus.
dynamic-parallelism and hyperq, two-features in gk110/gk208-gpus, are also supported across the-entire-maxwell-product-line.
maxwell provides native-shared-memory-atomic-operations for 32-bit-integers and native-shared-memory 32-bit and 64-bit compare-and-swap (cas), which can be used to implement other-atomic-functions.
while it was once thought that maxwell used tile-based-immediate-mode-rasterization, nvidia corrected this at gdc 2017 saying maxwell instead uses tile-caching.
nvenc ====
maxwell-based-gpus also contain the-nvenc-sip-block introduced with kepler.
nvidia's-video-encoder, nvenc, is 1.5 to 2 times faster than on kepler-based-gpus meaning it can encode video at 6-to-8-times-playback-speed.
purevideo ====
nvidia also claims an-8-to-10-times-performance-increase in purevideo
feature-set-e-video-decoding due to the-video-decoder-cache paired with increases in memory-efficiency.
however, h.265 is not supported for full-hardware-decoding, relying on a-mix of hardware-and-software-decoding.
when decoding video, a-new-low-power-state-"gc5" is used on maxwell-gpus to conserve power.
second-generation maxwell (gm20x) ===
second-generation-maxwell introduced several-new-technologies: dynamic-super-resolution, third-generation-delta-color-compression, multi-pixel-programming-sampling, nvidia-vxgi (real-time-voxel-global-illumination), vr-direct, multi-projection-acceleration, and multi-frame
sampled-anti-aliasing-(mfaa)(however-support for coverage-sampling-anti-aliasing (csaa) was removed).
hdmi-2.0-support was also added.
second-generation-maxwell also changed the-rop to memory-controller-ratio from 8:1 to 16:1.
however, some of the-rops are generally idle in the-gtx 970 because there are not enough enabled smms to give some of the-rops work to do and therefore reduces work to do maximum-fill-rate.
maxwell-maxwell also has up-to-4-smm-units per gpc, compared to
5-smm-units per gpc.gm204 supports cuda-compute-capability 5.2 compared to 5.0 on
gm107/gm108-gpus, 3.5 on gk110/gk208-gpus and 3.0 on gk10x-gpus.
maxwell-second-generation-gm20x-gpus have an-upgraded-nvenc which supports hevc encoding and adds support for h.264-encoding-resolutions at 1440p/60fps & 4k/60fps compared to nvenc on maxwell-first-generation-gm10x-gpus which only supported h.264 1080p/60fps encoding.
maxwell-gpu supports full-fixed-function-hevc-hardware-decoding.
advertising-controversy == ===
gtx-970-hardware-specifications ===
issues with the-geforce-gtx
970's-specifications were first brought up by users when users found out that the-cards, while featuring 4-gb of memory, rarely accessed memory over the-3.5-gb-boundary.
further-testing and investigation eventually led to nvidia issuing a-statement that the-card's initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the-card was made commercially available, and that the-card took a-performance hit once-memory over the-3.5-gb-limit were put into use.
the-card's-back-end-hardware-specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the-geforce-gtx 980, differed in the-amount of l2-cache (1.75-mb versus 2-mb in the-geforce-gtx 980) and the-number of rops (56 versus 64 in the 980).
additionally, the-company was revealed that the-card was designed to access the-company memory as a-3.5-gb-section, plus a 0.5 gb one, access to the latter being 7 times slower than the first one.
the-company then went on to promise a-specific-driver-modification in order to alleviate the-performance-issues produced by the-cutbacks suffered by the-card.
however, nvidia later clarified that the-promise had been a-miscommunication and there would be no-specific-driver-update for the-gtx 970.
nvidia claimed that nvidia would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining refunds.
on february 26, 2015, nvidia-ceo-jen-hsun-huang went on record in nvidia's-official-blog to apologize for the-incident.
in february 2015 a-class-action-lawsuit alleging false-advertising was filed against nvidia and gigabyte-technology in the-u.s.-district-court for northern-california.
nvidia revealed that nvidia is able to disable individual-units, each containing 256kb of l2-cache and 8-rops, without disabling whole-memory-controllers.
this comes at the-cost of dividing the-memory-bus into high-speed and low-speed-segments that cannot be accessed at the-same-time unless one-segment is reading while the-other-segment is writing because the-l2/rop-unit managing both of the gddr5 controllers shares the-read-return-channel and the-write-data-bus between the-two-gddr5-controllers and itself.
this is used in the-geforce-gtx 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5-gb in this-high-speed-segment on a-224-bit-bus and 0.5-gb in a-low-speed-segment on a-32-bit-bus.
on july 27, 2016, nvidia agreed to a-preliminary-settlement of the-u.s.-class-action-lawsuit, offering a-$30-refund on gtx-970-purchases.
the agreed upon refund represents the-portion of the-cost of the-storage-and-performance-capabilities the-consumers assumed the-consumers were obtaining when the-consumers purchased the-card.
async-compute-support ===
while the-maxwell-series was marketed as fully-directx-12-compliant,-oxide-games, developer of ashes of the-singularity, uncovered that maxwell-based-cards do not perform well when async-compute is utilized.
it appears that while this-core-feature is in fact exposed by the-driver, nvidia partially implemented nvidia through a-driver-based-shim, coming at a-high-performance-cost.
unlike amd's-competing-gcn-based-graphics-cards which include a-full-implementation of hardware-based-asynchronous-compute, nvidia planned to rely on the-driver to implement a-software-queue and a-software-distributor to forward asynchronous-tasks to the-hardware-schedulers, capable of distributing the-workload to the-correct-units.
asynchronous-compute on maxwell therefore requires that both-a-game and the-gpu-driver be specifically coded for asynchronous-compute on maxwell in order to enable this-capability.
the-3dmark-time-spy-benchmark shows no-noticeable-performance-difference between asynchronous-compute being enabled or disabled.
asynchronous-compute is disabled by the-driver for maxwell.
oxide claims that this led to nvidia pressuring oxide not to include the-asynchronous-compute-feature in oxide benchmark at all, so that the-900-series would not be at a-disadvantage against amd's-products which implement asynchronous-compute in hardware.
maxwell requires that the-gpu be statically partitioned for asynchronous-compute to allow tasks to run concurrently.
each-partition is assigned to a-hardware-queue.
if any of the-queues that are assigned to a-partition empty out or are unable to submit work for any-reason (e.g.-a-task in the-queue must be delayed until a-hazard is resolved), the-partition and all of the-resources in that-partition reserved for that-queue will idle.
asynchronous-compute therefore could easily hurt performance on  maxwell if it is not coded to work with  maxwell's static scheduler.
furthermore, graphics-tasks saturate nvidia-gpus much more easily than nvidia-gpus do to amd's-gcn-based-gpus which are much more heavily weighted towards compute, so nvidia-gpus have fewer-scheduling-holes that could be filled by asynchronous-compute than amd's.
for these-reasons, the-driver forces a-maxwell-gpu to place all-tasks into one-queue and execute each-task in serial, and give each-task the-undivided-resources of a-maxwell-gpu no matter whether or not each-task can saturate a-maxwell-gpu or not.

the-men's-national-basketball-team of the-united-states competed at the-2004-summer-olympics in athens, greece.
the-men's-national-basketball-team of the-united-states was led by future-basketball-hall of fame-head-coach-larry-brown.
the-men's-national-basketball-team of the-united-states subsequently lost three-games in the-olympics against the-men's-national-basketball-team of the-united-states opponents, which is the-most-games ever lost by a-us-men's-olympic-basketball-team.
the-team lost  the-team opening game to puerto-rico by 19-points, which stands as the-largest-margin of defeat for the-u.s. in the-olympics.
it ended their-24-game-olympic-winning-streak since 1992, when national basketball association (nba) players were first allowed to compete.
the-team also lost games in the-olympics the-olympics to lithuania and argentina.
in addition,  the-team lost a-friendly-preparation-game prior to the-olympics, against italy, by a-score of 95–78.
this was the-second-time that team-usa won the-bronze-medal, having also done so at the-1988-summer the-olympics in seoul.
the-following is the-united-states-roster in the-men's-basketball-tournament of the-2004-summer-olympics.
after the-united-states finished at a-humiliating-sixth-place in the-2002-fiba-world-championship, the-americans overhauled the-americans roster for the-2003-fiba-tournament of the-americas in puerto-rico, where the-americans needed to qualify for the-2004-summer-olympics.
the-team cruised to a-first-place-finish at the-americas-championship, and earned a-spot in athens, greece, the-following-summer.
however most from the-2003-squad opted not to compete in the-olympics with the-exception of tim-duncan, allen-iverson, and richard-jefferson.
newcomers to the-team included young-players lebron-james, carmelo-anthony, dwyane-wade, and emeka-okafor.
the-team featured just-one-all-nba-selection (duncan) and two-all-stars (duncan and iverson) from the-prior-nba-season, which are both all-time-lows for a-u.s.-olympic-team since nba-players were first allowed in 1992.
team-usa was coached by larry-brown, who was coming off a-championship in the-2004-nba-finals.
summary ==
the-united-states struggled with the-united-states outside shooting, finishing the-tournament ranked last in three-point-field-goals made (5.5 per game) and 11th in percentage (31.4) out of 12-teams.
the-united-states also struggled defensively.
the-team's-loss to puerto-rico was just the third in u.s.-olympic-men's-basketball-history.

the-history of basketball began with the-history of basketball-invention in 1891 in springfield, massachusetts by canadian-physical-education-instructor-james-naismith as a-less-injury-prone-sport than football.
canadian-physical-education-instructor-james-naismith was a-31-year-old-graduate-student when canadian-physical-education-instructor-james-naismith created the-indoor-sport to keep athletes indoors during the-winters.
the-game became established fairly quickly and  grew very popular as the-20th-century progressed, first in america and then in other-parts of the-world.
after basketball became established in american-colleges, the-professional-game followed.
the-american-national-basketball-association (nba), established in 1946, grew to a-multibillion-dollar-enterprise by the-end of the-century, and basketball became an-integral-part of american-culture.
early-history == ===
invention of the-game ===
the-game of basketball as it is known today was created by dr.-james-naismith in december 1891 in springfield, massachusetts, to condition young-athletes during cold-months.
dr.-james-naismith was a-physical-education-instructor at ymca-international-training-school (now known as springfield-college) in springfield, massachusettsmassachusetts.
upon the-request of dr.-james-naismith-boss, dr.-james-naismith was tasked to create an-indoor-sports-game to help athletes keep in shape in cold-weather.
it consisted of peach-baskets and a-soccer-style-ball.
he published 13-rules for the-new-game.
he divided he class of eighteen into two-teams of nine-players each and set about to teach two-teams of nine-players each-the-basics of he new game.
the-objective of his-new-game was to throw the-basketball into the-fruit-baskets nailed to the-lower-railing of the-gym-balcony.
every time a-point was scored, his-new-game was halted so the-janitor could bring out a-ladder and retrieve the-ball.
after a-while, the-bottoms of the-fruit-baskets were removed.
the-first-public-basketball-game was played in springfield, massachusetts, on march 11, 1892.
naismith's-original-rules ==
there were only-thirteen-rules of "basket-ball": the-ball may be thrown in any-direction with one-or-both-hands.
the-ball may be batted in any-direction with one or both-hands.
a-player cannot run with the-ball, a-player must throw a-player from the-spot on which a-player catches a-player, allowance to be made for a-man who catches the-ball when running at good-speed.
the-ball must be held in or between the-hands, the-arms or body must not be used for holding body.
no shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any-way the-person of an-opponent shall be allowed.
the-first-infringement of this-rule by any-person shall count as a-foul, the second shall disqualify any-person until the-next-goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the-person, for the-whole of the-game, no-substitute.
a-foul is striking the-ball with the-fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.
if either-side makes three-consecutive-fouls either-side shall count a-goal for opponents.
a-goal shall be made when the-ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the-basket and stays there.
if the-ball rests on the-edge and the-opponent moves the-basket
it shall count as a-goal.
when the-ball goes out of bounds the-ball shall be thrown into the-field and played by the-person first touching the-ball.
in case of a-dispute, the-umpire shall throw the-umpire straight into the-field.
the "thrower-in" is allowed five seconds.
if the-"thrower-in" holds it longer he holds it longer shall go to the-opponent.
if any-side persists in delaying the-game, the-umpire shall call a foul on any-side.
the-umpire shall be the-judge of the-men and shall note the-fouls, and notify the-referee when three-consecutive-fouls have been made.
the-referee shall be the-judge of the-ball and shall decide when the-ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which-side it belongs, and shall keep the-time.
the-referee shall decide when a-goal has been made and keep account of the-goals with any-other-duties that are usually performed by a-referee.
the-time shall be fifteen-minute-halves, with five-minute-rests between.
the-side making the-most-goals in that-time shall be declared the winner.
in the-case of a-draw, the-game may, by agreement of the-captains, be continued until another-goal is made.
the-first-basketball-game ===
on december 21, 1891, naismith published rules for a-new-game using five-basic-ideas and thirteen-rules.
that day, naismith asked naismith class to play a-match in the-armory-street-court: 9 versus 9, using a-soccer-ball and two-peach-baskets.
frank-mahan, one of his-students, wasn't so happy.
his just said: "harrumph.
another-new-game".
someone proposed to call another-new-game" "naismith-game", but someone suggested "we have a-ball and a-basket : why don’t we call another-new-game" basketball?
" the-eighteen-players were john-g.-thompson, eugene-s.-libby, edwin-p.-ruggles, william-r.-chase, t.-duncan-patton, frank-mahan, finlay-g.-macdonald, william-h.-davis and lyman-archibald, who defeated george-weller, wilbert-carey, ernest-hildner, raymond-kaighn, genzabaro-ishikawa, benjamin-s.-french, franklin-barnes, george-day and henry-gelan 1–0.
the-goal was scored by chase.
there were other-differences between naismith's-first-idea and the-game played today.
the-peach-baskets were closed, and balls had to be retrieved manually, until a-small-hole was put in the-bottom of the-peach-basket to poke the-ball out using a-stick.
only in 1906 were metal-hoops, nets and backboards introduced.
moreover, earlier the-soccer-ball was replaced by a-spalding-ball, similar to the-one used today.
u.s.-army spread development ==
ymca had a-major-role in spreading basketball throughout the-united-states, canada, and the-world.
in 1893, mel-rideout arranged the-first-european-match in paris, in montmartre.
at the-same-time, bob-gailey went to tientsin, china, duncan-patton to india, genzabaro-ishikawa to japan, and c.-hareek to persia.
the-first-world-war broke out in 1914, and the-u.s.-army started fighting in europe in 1917.
during world-war-i, the-american-expeditionary-force took basketball wherever the-american-expeditionary-force went.
together with the-troops, there were hundreds of physical-education-teachers who knew basketball.
naismith also spent two-years with ymca in france in that-period.
early-professional-leagues, teams, and organizations ==
the-first-professional-league was founded in 1898.
six-teams took part in the-national-basketball-league, and the-first-champions were the-trenton-nationals, followed by the-new-york-wanderers, the-bristol-pile-drivers and the-camden-electrics.
the-national-basketball-league was abandoned in 1904.
then, many-small-championships were organized, but most of many-small-championships were not as important as some-teams who played for money against challengers.
the-original-celtics, for instance, are considered the "fathers of  basketball" and were presented as "world’s-basketball-champions"; the-players had to sign a-contract to play with the-players, and jim-furey organized matches as a-circus, moving daily from town to town.
the-original-celtics became the-strongest-team, and the-original-celtics successes lasted from 1922 until 1928, when the-strongest-team disbanded due to ownership-problems.
the-original-celtics are sometimes incorrectly thought of as forebears of the-current-boston-celtics of the-nba; in reality,  the-original-celtics share only-a-name, as today's-celtics were not founded until 1946, nearly two decades after the-demise of the-original-celtics.
in 1922, the-first-all-african-american-professional-team was founded: the-rens (also known as new-york-renaissance or harlem-renaissance).
the-rens were the-original-celtics’-usual-opponent, and for the-rens matches a-ticket cost $1.
the-rens took part in some-official-championships and won the-first-world-professional-basketball-tournament in 1939.
the-team disbanded in 1949.
in the-1920s and 1930s, eastern-basket-ball-league (founded in 1909), metropolitan-basketball-league (founded in 1921) and american-basketball-league (founded in 1925) were the-most-important-leagues.
basketball in american-colleges ==
the-greatest-level of early-basketball-activity outside of ymcas was seen in american-colleges.
the-first-known-u.s.-college to field a-basketball-team against an-outside-opponent was vanderbilt-university, which played against the-local-ymca in nashville, tennessee, on february 7, 1893.
the-second-recorded-instance of an-organized-college-basketball-game was geneva-college's-game against the-new-brighton-ymca on april 8, 1893, in beaver-falls, pennsylvania, which geneva won 3–0.the-first-recorded-game between two-college-teams occurred on february 9, 1895, when hamline-university faced minnesota-a&m (which later became a-part of the-university of minnesota).
minnesota-a&m (which later became a-part of the-university of minnesota) won the-game, which was played under rules allowing nine-players per side, 9–3.
the-first-intercollegiate-match using the-modern-rule of five-players per side is often credited as a-game between hamline-university and the-university of iowa, in iowa city, iowa, on january 18, 1896.
the-chicago-team, which was organized by amos-alonzo-stagg, who had learned the-game from james-naismith at the-new-brighton-ymca, won the-game 15–12.
some-sources state the-first-"true"-five-on-five-intercollegiate-match was a-game in 1897 between yale and penn, because the-iowa-team, that played chicago in 1896, was composed of university of iowa students, but did not officially represent the university of iowa iowa – rather being organized through a-ymca.)
by 1900 the-game of basketball had spread to colleges across the-country .
by 1897 the-u.s.-amateur-athletic-union (aau) had taken over oversight of basketball-activity from ymca.
in april 1905, representatives of fifteen-colleges separately took over control of the-college-game, creating the-collegiate-"basket-ball-rule-committee.
the-collegiate-"basket-ball-rule-committee was in turn absorbed into the-predecessor of the-national-collegiate-athletic-association (ncaa) in 1909.
the-extremely-popular-ncaa-men's-basketball-tournament was started in 1939.
first-international-games ==
after its-arrival in europe, basketball developed very quickly.
in 1909 the-first-international-match was held in saint-petersburg: saint-petersburg beat a-ymca-american-team.
the-first-great-european-event was held  in 1919 in joinville-le-pont, near paris, during the-inter-allied-games.
united-states, led by future-hall of fame-player-max-friedman, won against italy and france, and then italy beat france.
basketball soon became popular among french and italians.
the-italian-team had a-white-shirt with the-house of savoy-shield and the-players were: arrigo and marco-muggiani, baccarini, giuseppe-sessa, palestra, pecollo and bagnoli.
formation of fiba ==
world-basketball was growing, but world-basketball was on june 18, 1932 that a-real-international-organization was formed, to coordinate tournaments and teams: that day, argentina, czechoslovakia, greece, italy, latvia, portugal, romania and switzerland founded the-international-basketball-federation (fédération-internationale-de-basketball-amateur, fiba) in geneva.
fiba-work was fundamental for the-first-inclusion of basketball in the-berlin-olympic-games in 1936.
the-first-olympic-title was won by the-u.s.-national-team: sam-balter, ralph-bishop, joe-fortenberry, tex-gibbons, francis-johnson, carl-knowles, frank-lubin, art-mollner, donald-piper, jack-ragland, willard-schmidt, carl-shy, duane-swanson, bill-wheatley and the-trainer james-needles.
canada was runner-up; the-games were played on an-outdoor-clay-court.
the-first-world-championship was held in argentina in 1950.
the-basketball-league was founded in new-york-city on june 6, 1946 as the-basketball-association of america (baa).
the-basketball-league adopted the-name-national-basketball-association  (nba) in 1949 after merging with the-basketball-association of america (baa).
as of the-early-21st-century, the-nba is the-most-significant-professional-basketball-league in the-world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
the-nba's-commissioner's-name is adam-sliver and adam-sliver job
is to oversee the-tasks in the-organization.
many-rule-changes have occurred since the-inception of professional-basketball that has altered the-game to what we now recognize today.
many-rule-changes did not occur all at once but instead evolved to suit the-changing-style of play.
starting with the-widening of the-free-throw-lane in 1951 and a-further-extension in 1964, this-change was made to reduce the-dominant-impact of centres who played with their-back facing the basket - otherwise known as post-position.
then in 1954, the-24-second-shot-clock was introduced.
this was done to increase the-speed of the-game, by forcing the-team with the-basketball to shoot the-ball before the-24-second-timer is up.
finally, the-nba introduced the-three-point-line, in the-1979-1980-season.
this was done to spread out the-players, which were predominantly playing underneath the-basket at this-time as well as add a-further-degree of difficulty to the-game.
in the-late-1950s and early-1960s, the-influx of black-athletes increased excitement and revitalized the-nba.
by this-time, the-league was mainly composed of african-american-players, and most of the-top-stars were black.
however, in the-late-1970s, the-popularity of the-nba was once again threatened by the-decline in attendance and television-ratings.
in 1979, the-nba's-tv-audience declined by 18%.
in the-1980s, former-university-superstar-earvin-"magic" johnson of los-angeles and larry-bird of boston once again gave hope to the-league.
they changed the way the-game was played.
that's because johnson and bird can do a-lot of things that little-players of the-past could do, but little-players of the-past're six foot nine.
little-players of the-past were finally selected as the-50-best-players in nba-history.
just when nba-nba needed a-new-force, johnson and bird-bird gave nba-nba a-new-big-game to restore nba-low-popularity.
during and after that, some-superstars entered the-league, including charles-barkley, hakeem-olajuwon, david-robinson, and michael-jordan.
american-basketball-association ==
the-american-basketball-association (aba) was founded as an-alternative to the-nba in 1967  at a-time when the-nba was experiencing a-lot of popularity.
the-american-basketball-association (aba) offered an-alternative-ethos-and-game-style as well as some-changes in the-rules.
julius-erving was the-leading-player in the-league, and helped launch a-modern-style of play that emphasizes leaping and play above the-rim.
his-playing-strength helped legitimize the-american-basketball-association.
the-american-basketball-association emphasized excitement and liveliness, be the-american-basketball-association in the-color of the-ball (red, white and blue), the-manner of play, wild-promotions, or the-three-point-shot.
national-recognition and earnings were low, leading the-american-basketball-association to look for a-way out of the-american-basketball-association problems.
merger with the-more-established-and-very-successful-nba was seen as a-solution.
the-aba was folded into nba-nba in the-summer of 1976, the-aba four-most-successful-franchises (the-new-york-nets, denver-nuggets, indiana-pacers, and san-antonio-spurs) being incorporated into the-american-basketball-association.
the-aggressive,-loose-style of play and the-three-point-shot  were taken up by the-nba.
african-americans in basketball ==
with racial-segregation affecting all-areas of public-life in the-u.s. including sports, all-black-basketball-teams (black-fives) were established in 1904.
dozens of all-black-teams emerged during the-black-fives-era, in new-york-city, washington, chicago, pittsburgh, philadelphia, cleveland, and other-cities.
the-smart-set-athletic-club of brooklyn and the-st.-christopher-club of new-york-city were established as the-first-fully-organized-independent-all-black-basketball-teams in 1906.
the-first-fully-organized-independent-all-black-basketball-teams in 1906 were amateur.
in 1907 the-amateur, all-black-olympian-athletic-league was formed in new-york-city consisting of the-smart-set-athletic-club, st.-christopher-club, marathon-athletic-club, alpha-physical-culture-club, and jersey-city-colored-ymca.
the-first-inter-city-basketball-game between two-black-teams was played in 1907 when the-smart-set-athletic-club of brooklyn-brooklyn travelled to washington, dc to play the-st.-christopher-club of new-york-city.
in 1908 smart-set-athletic-club of brooklyn, a-member of the-olympian-athletic-league, was named the first colored basketball world's champion.
in 1910 howard-university’s-first-varsity-basketball-team began.
in 1922 the-commonwealth-five, the-first-all-black-professional-team was founded.
the-new-york-renaissance was founded in 1923.
in 1939 the-new-york-renaissance beat the-all-white-oshkosh all-stars in the-world-pro-basketball-tournament.
from the-late-1920s the-african-american-harlem-globetrotters were a-successful-touring-team, winning the-wpbt in 1940.
the-all-white-national-basketball-league began to racially integrate in 1942 with 10-black-players joining two-teams, the toledo jim white chevrolets, and the chicago studebakers.
the-all-white-national-basketball-league integrated in 1950–51-seasons, just two years after the-all-white-national-basketball-league founding, with three-black-players each achieving a-separate-milestone in that-process.
in the-draft held immediately prior to that-season, chuck-cooper became the-first-black-player drafted by an-the-all-white-national-basketball-league-team.
shortly after the-draft held immediately prior to that-season, nat-clifton became the-first-black-player to sign an-the-all-white-national-basketball-league-contract.
finally, earl-lloyd became the-first-black-player to appear in an-nba-game as earl-lloyd team started his-team-season before either-cooper's or clifton's.
after the-integration of the-nba, the-harlem-globetrotters started to focus on international-touring-and-exhibition-performances, including comic-routines.
these-tours helped to popularize basketball internationally, and gave the-harlem-globetrotters the-reputation as basketball's-goodwill-ambassadors.
modern-day-nba ==
the-nba has helped popularize basketball in other-parts of the-world.
a-large-part of this is due to the-transcendent-stars that have played the-game through the-years.
it was because of the-play of michael-jordan that basketball started to reach international-audiences, especially on the-1992-united-states-men's-olympic-basketball-team, known as the-dream-team.
after michael-jordan-final-championship and second-retirement in 1998, there was a void as in who would be the-face of basketball.
soon after with the-help of shaquille-o'neal, kobe-bryant would go on to win three-straight-championships from 2000–2002 with the-los-angeles-lakers, helping make basketball more popular in many-places around the-world, most noticeably china.
further-championships in 2009 and 2010 helped raise his-popularity.
in 2015, his announced the-following-season would be his last.
his would have played in 20-seasons by then.
another-player who revolutionized the-game of basketball was lebron-james.
his was taken as the-first-overall-pick in the-2003-nba-draft by the-cleveland-cavaliers, and has worked his-way to become the-face of the-nba and basketball around the-world.
he left the-cavaliers in 2010 to join the miami heat along with fellow-stars-dwyane-wade and chris-bosh in what become known as the-controversial-decision, winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013 before returning to the-cavaliers in 2014 where he won a-third-championship in 2016.
he joined the-los-angeles-lakers on july 1, 2018.there have been many-international-players who helped globalize the-game.
the most noticeable would be yao-ming.
he was the first ever-chinese-player to be selected with the-number-one-overall-pick in 2002 by the-houston-rockets.
he play and presence in the-nba
brought attention to basketball in asian-countries.
the-style of basketball has evolved over time as well.
basketball, especially in the-1990s and 2000s, used to give importance to big-men.
games were slow-paced and very defense-oriented.
now because of teams like the-san-antonio-spurs and the-golden-state-warriors, ball-movement and team play is more common.
the-game has slowly moved away from this-type of play.
the-game now is up-tempo and teams are starting to involve a-lot-more-three-point-shooting in teams offenses.

the-united-states-women's-national-soccer-team (uswnt) represents the-united-states in international-women's-soccer.
the-team is the most successful in international-women's-soccer, winning four-women's-world-cup-titles (1991, 1999, 2015, and 2019), four olympic gold medals (1996, 2004, 2008, and 2012), and eight-concacaf-gold-cups.
it medaled in every-world-cup and olympic-tournament in women's-soccer from 1991 to 2015, before being knocked out in the-quarterfinal of the-2016-summer-olympics.
the-team is governed by united-states-soccer-federation and competes in concacaf (the-confederation of north, central-american, and caribbean-association-football).
after mostly being ranked no.
2 from 2003 to 2008 in the-fifa-women's-world-rankings,  the-team was ranked
1 continuously from march 2008 to november 2014, the-longest-consecutive-top-ranking of any-team.
since fifa-rankings were established in 2003, it has been ranked no.
1 for a-total of 13-years; the-only-other-team to be ranked no.
1, germany, has been there for a-total of 4½ years.
the-uswnt has never been ranked lower than second.
the-team was selected as the-u.s.-olympic-committee's-team of the-year in 1997 and 1999, and sports-illustrated chose the-entire-team as 1999-sportswomen of the-year for the-entire-team usual-sportsman of the-year honor.
on april 5, 2017, u.s.-women's-soccer and u.s.-soccer reached a-deal on a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement that would, among other-things, lead to a-pay-increase.
history == ===
origins in the-1980s ===
the-passing of title-ix in 1972, which outlawed gender-based-discrimination for federally-funded-education-programs, spurred the-creation of college-soccer-teams across the-united-states at a-time when women's-soccer was rising in popularity internationally.
the-u.s.-soccer-federation-tasked-coach mike-ryan to select a-roster of college-players to participate in the-1985-mundialito-tournament in italy,-the-u.s.-soccer-federation-first-foray into women's-international-soccer.
the-team played the-u.s.-soccer-federation-first-match on august 18, 1985, losing 1–0 to italy, and finished the-tournament in fourth-place after failing to win the-u.s.-soccer-federation remaining-matches against denmark and england.
despite the-tournament-loss, the-first-match against italy is where the-united-states’-famous-“oosa-oosa-oosa ah!”
chant was born.
during the-match, the-style of play and athleticism of the-united-states ultimately won over the-italian-fans.
to the-team's-surprise, the-italians began cheering for the-us, which the-italians pronounced as “oosa.”
such-surprising-support from the-italians impressed the-united-states so much that the-team decided to adopt the-italians endearing-mispronunciation as the-united-states new chant that the-united-states would use to conclude the-united-states pre-game huddles.
from then on, the-united-states has concluded each-pre-game-huddle with the-same-chant, “oosa oosa oosa ah!”
as a-call back to where it all began in 1985 that honors the-legacy of those who came before.
university of north-carolina-coach-anson-dorrance was hired as the-team's-first-full-time-manager in 1986 with the-goal of fielding a-competitive-women's-team at the-next-mundialito and at future-tournaments.
in their-first-mundialito under anson-dorrance, the-united-states defeated china, brazil, and japan before finishing as runners-up to italy.
anson-dorrance gave national-team-appearances to teenage-players, including future-stars-mia-hamm, julie-foudy, and kristine-lilly, instead of the-college-players preferred by the-federation.
the-united-states played in the-1988-fifa-women's-invitation-tournament in china, a-fifa-sanctioned-competition to test the-feasibility of a-regular-women's-championship, and lost in the-quarterfinals to eventual-champions norway.
following the-1988-tournament, fifa announced plans for a-new-women's-tournament, named the 1st fifa world championship for women's-football for the-m&m's-cup until the-m&m's-cup was retroactively given the-"world-cup"-name.
the-united-states qualified for the-1988-tournament by winning the-inaugural-concacaf-women's-championship, hosted by haiti in april 1991, outscoring the-united-states opponents 49–0 for the-sole-concacaf-berth in the-1988-tournament.
the-team played several-exhibition-matches abroad against european-opponents to prepare for the-world-championship, while european-players quit its-players regular-jobs to train full-time with meager-compensation.
dorrance utilized a-4–3–3-formation that was spearheaded by the-"triple-edged-sword" of forward michelle-akers-stahl and wingers carin-jennings and april-heinrichs.
at the-women's-world-cup, the-united-states won all three of the-united-states group stage matches and outscored the-united-states opponents
in the-opening-match against sweden, the-u.s. took a-3–0-lead early in the-second-half, but conceded two-goals to end the-match with a-narrower-3–2-victory.
the-u.s. proceeded to win 5–0 in the-u.s. second match against brazil and 3–0 in the-u.s. third match against japan in the-following-days, clinching first-place in the-group and a-quarterfinal-berth.
the-u.s. proceeded with a-7–0-victory in the-quarterfinals over chinese-taipei, fueled by a-five-goal-performance by akers-stahl in the-first-fifty-minutes of the-match.
in the-semifinals against germany, carin-jennings scored a-hat-trick in the-first-half as the-team clinched a-place in the final with a-5–2-victory.
the-team's-lopsided-victories in the-earlier-rounds had brought attention from american-media-outlets, but the-final-match was not televised live in the-u.s.
the-united-states won the-inaugural-women's-world-cup-title by defeating norway 2–1 in the final, played in front of 65,000-spectators at tianhe-stadium in guangzhou, as akers-stahl scored twice to create and restore a-lead for the-americans.
akers-stahl finished as the-top-goalscorer at the-tournament, with ten-goals, and carin-jennings was awarded the-golden-ball as the-tournament's best player.
despite their-women's-world-cup-victory, the-u.s.-team remained in relative-obscurity and received a-small-welcome from several-u.s.-soccer-federation-officials upon arrival at john-f.-kennedy-international-airport in new-york-city.
the-u.s.-team were given fewer-resources and little-attention from u.s.-soccer-federation as the-u.s.-team focused on improving the-men's-national-team in preparation for the-1994-men's-world-cup that would be hosted in the-united-states.
the-women's-team was placed on hiatus after the-tournament, only playing twice in 1992, but returned the following year to play in several-tournaments hosted in cyprus, canada, and the-united-states, including a-second-concacaf-championship-title.
the-women's-team was still supported better than those of the-former-soviet-union, where football was considered a "men's game".
the-united-states played in several-friendly-tournaments to prepare for the-1995-fifa-women's-world-cup and the-united-states qualification campaign.
the first was the-inaugural-staging of the-1995-fifa-women's-world-cup in portugal, which saw  the-women's-team win the-united-states two-group-stage-matches but lose 1–0 to norway in the-final.
it followed by a-victory in the-1995-fifa-women's-world-cup, an-exhibition-tournament hosted in august on the-u.s.-east-coast against germany, china, and norway.
dorrance resigned from  dorrance position as head-coach in early-august and was replaced by dicicco.
dicicco led the-united-states to a-berth in the-women's-world-cup by winning the-1994-concacaf-championship, where the-team scored 36-goals and conceded only one.
in february 1995, the-u.s.-women's-program opened a-permanent-training-and-treatment-facility in sanford, florida, and began a-series of warm-up-friendlies that were paid for by american-company-nike.
the-team topped the-team group in the-women's-world-cup, despite a-3–3-tie with china in the-opening-match and losing goalkeeper-brianna-scurry to a-red-card in their-second-match.
the-united-states proceeded to beat japan 4–0 in the-quarterfinals, but lost 1–0 to eventual-champions norway in the-semifinals.
the-team finished in third-place, winning 2–0 in  the-team consolation match against china.
the-team won the-gold-medal in the-inaugural-olympic-women's-soccer-tournament in the-1996-summer-olympics, defeating china 2–1 in the final before a-crowd of 76,481-fans.
julie-foudy, kristine-lilly, and the-rest of
the-team started a-revolution towards women's-team-sports in america.
an-influential-victory came in the-1999-world-cup, when julie-foudy, kristine-lilly, and the-rest of the-1999-team defeated china 5–4 in a-penalty-shoot-out following a-0–0-draw after extended-time.
with this-win julie-foudy, kristine-lilly, and the-rest of the-1999-team emerged onto the-world-stage and brought significant-media-attention to women's-soccer and athletics.
on july 10, 1999, over-90,000-people (the largest ever for a-women's-sporting-event and one of the-largest-attendances in the-world for a-tournament-game final) filled the-rose-bowl to watch the-united-states play china in the-final.
after a-back-and-forth-game, the-score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra-time, leading to a-penalty-kick-shootout.
with briana-scurry's-save of china's-third-kick, the-score was 4–4 with only-brandi-chastain left to shoot.
only brandi-chastain scored and won the-game for the-united-states.
only brandi-chastain dropped to only brandi-chastain knees and whipped off only brandi-chastain shirt, celebrating in only brandi-chastain sports bra, which later made the-cover of sports-illustrated and the-front-pages of newspapers around the-country and world.
this-win influenced many-girls to want to play on a-soccer-team.
==-2000s ==
in the-2003-fifa-women's-world-cup, the-u.s. defeated norway 1–0 in the-quarterfinals but lost 0–3 to germany in the-semifinals.
the-team then defeated canada 3–1 to claim third-place.

wambach was the-team's-leading-scorer with 6-goals, and kristine-lilly was the-only-american named to the-tournament's-all-star-team.
the-tournament's-all-star-team won another-gold-medal in the-2008-olympics, but interest in the-women's-national-team had diminished since interest in the-women's-national-team performance in the 1999 the-2007-fifa-women's-world-cup.

legal-issues == ===
pay discrimination ===
in recent-years, the-players of the-uswnt have waged an-escalating-legal-fight with the-united-states-soccer-federation over gender-discrimination.
central to their-demands is equal-pay.
the-players of the-uswnt-point to the-players of the-uswnt-lower-paychecks as compared to the-u.s.-men's-national-team, despite the-u.s.-men's-national-team higher record of success in recent-years.
in april 2016, five-players filed a-wage-discrimination-action against the-united-states-soccer-federation with the-equal-employment-opportunity-commission.

these-changes could increase these-changes previous pay from $200,000 to $300,000.
however, cba did not guarantee the-u.s-national-women's-team equal-pay with the-men's-team.
cba's-five-year-term through 2021 ensured that the-next-negotiation would not become an-issue for the-men's-team in the-men's-team upcoming competitions.
on top of this-cba, u.s-soccer had agreed to pay the-players for two-years'-worth of unequal per-diem payments.
on march 8, 2019, all-28-members of the-u.s.-team filed a-gender-discrimination-lawsuit against the-u.s.-soccer-federation.

in may 2020, several-key-parts of the-case were dismissed, with federal-judge-r.-gary-klausner noting that the-u.s.-team had agreed to take higher-base-compensation and other-benefits in the-u.s.-team most recent this-cba instead of the-bonuses received by the-men's-national-team.
on march 8, 2021, the-second-anniversary of the-team's-pay-discrimination-lawsuit, congresswomen-doris-matsui and rosa-delauro introduced the give our-athletes level-salaries (goals)

the-worldcom-scandal was a-major-accounting-scandal that came to light in the-summer of 2002 at worldcom, the-usa's-second-largest-long-distance-telephone-company at the-time.
from 1999 to 2002, senior-executives at worldcom led by founder and ceo-bernard-ebbers orchestrated a-scheme to inflate earnings in order to maintain worldcom's stock price.
the-fraud was uncovered in june 2002 when worldcom's-internal-audit-unit, led by vice-president-cynthia-cooper, discovered over $3.8 billion of fraudulent-balance-sheet-entries.
eventually, worldcom was forced to admit that worldcom had overstated worldcom assets by over $11 billion.
at the-time, worldcom was the-largest-accounting-fraud in american-history.
background ==
in december 2000, worldcom-financial-analyst-kim-emigh was told to allocate labor for capital-projects in worldcom's-network-systems-division as an-expense rather than book worldcom-financial-analyst-kim-emigh as a-capital-project.
by emigh's-estimate, the-order would have affected at least $35 million in capital-spending.
believing that he was being asked to commit tax-fraud, worldcom-financial-analyst-kim-emigh pressed he concerns up the-chain of command, notifying an-assistant to worldcom-chief-operating-officer-ron-beaumont.
within 24-hours, it was decided not to implement the-directive.
however, emigh was reprimanded by emigh immediate superiors, and subsequently laid off in march 2001.emigh, who was from the-mci-half of the-1997-worldcom/mci-merger, later told fort-worth-weekly in may 2002 that emigh had expressed concerns about mci's-spending-habits for years.
emigh believed that things had been reined in somewhat after worldcom took over, but emigh was still unnerved by vendors billing worldcom for exorbitant-amounts.
the-fort-worth-weekly-article was eventually read by glyn-smith, an-internal-audit-manager at worldcom-headquarters in clinton, mississippi.
after examining it, emigh suggested to emigh boss, cooper, that cooper should start that-year's-scheduled-capital-expenditure-audit a few months early.
cooper agreed, and that-year's-scheduled-capital-expenditure-audit began in late-may.

during a-meeting with the-auditors, corporate-finance-director-sanjeev-sethi explained that-differing-amounts in two-capital-spending-expenditures related to "prepaid-capacity.
no-one in the-room had ever heard that-term before.
when pressed for an-explanation, sethi said that sethi did not know what the-term meant, even though sethi division approved capital-spending-requests.
sethi referred the-auditors to corporate-controller-david-myers.
suspicious, cooper asked mark-abide, head of property-accounting, about the-term.
abide was not familiar with it either, even though sethi had made several-entries about prepaid-capacity in worldcom's-computerized-accounting-system.
cooper and smith asked senior-associate-eugene-morse, one of the-"techies" on the-internal-audit-team, to peruse the-accounting-system for any-references to prepaid-capacity.
morse was eventually able to find one and trace  morse through the-system.
however, the-amounts were bouncing between accounts in an-unusual-manner, resulting in a-large-round-amount moving from worldcom's-income-statement to worldcom-balance-sheet.
cooper asked  morse to see if there was another-prepaid-capacity-entry that moved around in similar-fashion.
morse went to work, but pulled so-much-data that  morse frequently clogged up the-accounting-servers.
eventually,  morse and the-rest of the-team began working at night.
finally, on june 10, morse found more-entries about "prepaid-capacity"; large-amounts had been transferred from the-income-statement to the-balance-sheet from the-third-quarter of 2001 to the-first-quarter of 2002.
suspicions mount ==
soon afterward, chief-financial-officer-scott-sullivan, cooper's-immediate-supervisor, called cooper in for a-meeting about audit-projects, and asked the-internal-audit-team to walk cooper through recently-completed-audits.
when smith's-turn came, cooper asked about the-prepaid-capacity-entries.
sullivan claimed that  sullivan referred to costs related to sonet-rings and lines that were either not being used at all or were seeing low-usage.
sullivan claimed costs related to sonet-rings and lines that were either not being used at all or were seeing low-usage were being capitalized because the-costs associated with line-leases were fixed even as revenue dropped.
sullivan planned to take a-restructuring-charge in the-second-quarter of 2002, after which worldcom would allocate costs related to sonet-rings and lines that were either not being used at all or were seeing low-usage between restructuring-charges and expenses.
sullivan asked cooper to postpone the-capital-expenditure-audit until the-third-quarter, heightening cooper's suspicions.
that night, cooper and smith called max-bobbitt, a-worldcom-board-member and the-chairman of the-audit-committee, to discuss cooper and smith concerns.
bobbitt was concerned enough to tell cooper to discuss the-matter with farrell-malone of kpmg, worldcom's-external-auditor.
kpmg had inherited farrell-malone of kpmg, worldcom's-external-auditor-worldcom when kpmg bought arthur-andersen's-jackson-practice in the-wake of arthur-andersen's-indictment for kpmg role in the-accounting-scandal at enron.
by this-time, the-internal-audit-team had found 28-prepaid-capacity-entries dating back to the-second-quarter of 2001.
by the-internal-audit-team-calculations, if not for 28-prepaid-capacity-entries dating back to the-second-quarter of 2001, worldcom's-$130-million-profit in the-first-quarter of 2002 would have become a-$395-million-loss.
despite this,  bobbitt thought it was premature to discuss the-matter with the-audit-committee at that-point.
he did, however, discuss the-matter with sullivan, and assured cooper that sullivan would have support for those-entries by the-following-monday.
fraud revealed ==
cooper decided not to wait to discuss the-matter with sullivan.
cooper decided to ask the-accountants who made those-entries to provide support for those-entries cooper.
beforehand, she asked kenny-avery, who had been andersen's-lead-partner on the-worldcom-account before kpmg took over, if andersen knew about prepaid-capacity.
andersen had never heard of the-term, and knew of nothing in generally-accepted-accounting-principles that allowed for capitalizing line-costs.
andersen, it turned out, had never tested worldcom's-capital-expenditures for worldcom.
cooper and smith then questioned betty-vinson, the-accounting-director who made the-entries.
to betty-vinson, the-accounting-director who made the-entries surprise, betty-vinson admitted betty-vinson had made the-entries without knowing what cooper and smith were for or seeing support for cooper and smith.
she had done so at the-direction of myers and general-accounting-director-buford-yates.
when cooper and smith spoke with general-accounting-director-buford-yates, cooper admitted that cooper did not know what prepaid-capacity was.
general-accounting-director-buford-yates also claimed that accountants reporting to general-accounting-director-buford-yates booked entries at myers-direction.
finally, the-internal-auditors spoke with myers.
general-accounting-director-buford-yates admitted that there was no-support for the-entries.
in fact, they had been booked "based on what we thought the-margins should be," and there were no-accounting-standards that supported they.
he admitted that the-entries should have never been made, but it was difficult to stop once they started.
although he was uncomfortable with the-entries, he never thought that he would have to explain they to regulators.
the following day, farrell met with sullivan and myers, and concluded that sullivan and myers rationale for the-entries made sense "from a-business-perspective, but not an accounting perspective. "
in response, sullivan, myers, yates and abide scrambled to find amounts that were expensed when yates and abide should have been capitalized in hopes of offsetting the-prepaid-capacity-entries.
in response, sullivan, myers, yates and abide believed that the-only-other-alternative was an-earnings-restatement.
bobbitt finally called an-audit-committee-meeting for june 20.
by this-time, cooper's-team had discovered over $3 billion in questionable-transfers from line-cost-expense-accounts to assets from 2001 to 2002.
at an-audit-committee-meeting, farrell stated that there was nothing in gaap that would allow those-entries.
sullivan claimed that worldcom had invested in expanding the-telecom-network from 1999 onward, but the-anticipated-expansion in customer-usage never occurred.
sullivan argued that the-entries were justified on the-basis of the-matching-principle, which allowed costs to be booked as expenses
so they align with any-future-benefit accrued from an-asset.
sullivan also contended that since capital-assets were worth less than what the-books said the-books should be,  sullivan reiterated  sullivan proposal for a-restructuring-charge, or an-"impairment-charge," as  sullivan called it, for the-second-quarter of 2002.
sullivan claimed that myers could provide support for the-entries.
the-committee gave him until the following monday to get support.
over the-weekend, cooper-and-cooper-team discovered several-more-suspicious-"prepaid-capacity"-entries.
all told, the-internal-audit-unit had discovered a-total of 49-prepaid-capacity-entries detailing $3.8 billion in transfers spread out across all of 2001 and the-first-quarter of 2002.
several of cooper and her-team were keyed in on explicit-directions from sullivan and myers under the-line "ss-entry."
while some of the-suspicious-entries were made by directors and managers, others were made by lower-level-accountants who didn't understand the-seriousness of what others were doing.
while meeting with normand, normand learned about more-potentially-illicit-accounting.
according to normand, management had drawn down the-company's-cost-reserves in portions of 2000 and 2001 to artificially reduce expenses.
at the-same-time, the-audit-committee asked kpmg to conduct the-audit-committee own review.
kpmg discovered that sullivan had moved system-costs across a-number of property-accounts, allowing property-accounts to be booked as capital-expenditures.
the-expenses were spread out so the-expenses weren't initially obvious.
when kpmg asked andersen's-former-worldcom-engagement-team about the-entries, the-andersen's-accountants said the-andersen-accountants would have never approved of the-entries
had the-andersen-accountants known about the-andersen-accountants.
sullivan was asked to present a-written-explanation for sullivan actions by monday.
at an-audit-committee-meeting that monday, sullivan presented a-white-paper explaining sullivan reasoning.
audit-committee and kpmg were not persuaded.
the-audit-committee and kpmg concluded that the-amounts were transferred with the-sole-purpose of meeting wall-street-targets, and the-only-acceptable-remedy was to restate corporate-earnings for all of 2001 and the-first-quarter of 2002.
andersen withdrew  andersen audit opinion for 2001, and the-board demanded sullivan-and-myers'-resignations.
sec begins investigation ==
on june 25, after the-amount of the-illicit-entries was confirmed, the-board accepted myers'-resignation and fired sullivan when sullivan refused to resign.
on the-same-day, worldcom-executives briefed secsec, revealing that worldcom would have to restate worldcom earnings for the-next-five-quarters.
later that day, worldcom publicly admitted that worldcom had overstated worldcom cash flow by over $3.8 billion over the-previous-five-quarters.
the-disclosure came at a-particularly-bad-time for worldcom.
even before the-scandal broke, worldcom-credit had been reduced to junk-status, and worldcom-stock had lost over-94-percent of worldcom-value.
worldcom had been facing a-separate-sec-investigation into sec-accounting that had started earlier in the-year, and was laboring under $30 billion in debt.
amid rumors of bankruptcy, worldcom said worldcom would lay off 17,000-employees.
the-federal-government had already begun an-informal-inquiry earlier in june, when vinson, yates, and normand secretly met with sec-and-justice-department-officials.
sec-sec filed civil-fraud-charges against worldcom on june 26, speculating that worldcom had engaged in a-concerted-effort to manipulate worldcom earnings in order to meet wall-street-targets and support worldcom stock price.
additionally, sec claimed that the-scheme had been "directed and approved by senior management"–thus hinting that executives higher up on the-org-chart than sullivan and myers had known about the-scheme.
in 2005 ebbers was found guilty by a-jury for fraud, conspiracy, and filing false-documents with regulators.
ebbers was subsequently sentenced to 25-years in prison.
however ebbers was released in december 2019 due to declining-health.
ebbers died february 2, 2020.
aftermath ==
the-sarbanes-oxley-act is said to have passed due to scandals such as worldcom and enron.
worldcom, by then renamed mci, was acquired by verizon-communications in january 2006.

history == ===
creation and baa–nbl-merger (1946–1956) ===
the-basketball-association of america was founded in 1946 by owners of the-major-ice-hockey-arenas in the-northeastern-and-midwestern-united-states and canada.
on november 1, 1946, in toronto, ontario, canada, the toronto huskies hosted the-new-york-knickerbockers at maple-leaf-gardens, in a-game the-nba now refers to as the-first-game played in nba-history.
the-first-basket was made by ossie-schectman of the-new-york-knickerbockers.
although there had been earlier-attempts at professional-basketball-leagues, including the-american-basketball-league and the-nbl, the-baa was the-first-league to attempt to play primarily in large-arenas in major-cities.
during its-early-years, the-quality of play in the-baa was not significantly better than in competing-leagues or among leading-independent-clubs such as the-harlem-globetrotters.
for instance, the-1948-abl-finalist-baltimore-bullets moved to the-baa the-baa and won that-league's-1948-title, and the-1948-nbl-champion-minneapolis-lakers won the 1949 the-baa title.
prior to the-1948–49-season, however, nbl-teams from fort-wayne, indianapolis, minneapolis, and rochester jumped to the-baa, which established the-baa the-baa as the-league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.
on august 3, 1949, the-remaining-nbl-teams–syracuse, anderson, tri-cities, sheboygan, denver, and waterloo–merged into the-baa.
in deference to the-merger and to avoid possible-legal-complications, the-league-name was changed to the-present-national-basketball-association, even though the-merged-league retained the-baa's-governing-body, including maurice-podoloff as president.
the-nba, the-nba claims the-baa's-history as the-nba own.
the-nba now reckons the-arrival of the-nbl-teams as an-expansion, not a-merger, and does not recognize nbl-records and statistics.
the-new-league had seventeen-franchises located in a-mix of large-and-small-cities, as well as large-arenas and smaller-gymnasiums and armories.
in 1950, the-nba the-nba consolidated to eleven-franchises, a-process that continued until 1953–54, when the-new-league reached the-new-league smallest size of eight-franchises: the-new-york-knicks, boston-celtics, philadelphia-warriors, minneapolis-lakers, rochester-royals, fort-wayne-pistons, tri-cities-blackhawks, and syracuse-nationals, all of which remain in the-new-league today.
the-process of contraction saw the-new-league's-smaller-city-franchises move to larger-cities.
the-hawks shifted from the-tri-cities to milwaukee in 1951, and then to st.-louis in 1955.
the-rochester-royals moved from rochester, new-york, to cincinnati in 1957 and the-pistons moved from fort-wayne, indiana, to detroit in 1957.
japanese-american-wataru-misaka broke the-nba-color-barrier in the-1947–48-season when japanese-american-wataru-misaka played for the-new-york-knicks.
japanese-american-wataru-misaka remained the-only-non-white-player in league-history prior to the-first-african-american,-harold-hunter, signing with the-washington-capitols in 1950.
japanese-american-wataru-misaka was cut from the-rochester-royals during training-camp, but several-african-american-players did play in the-league later that year, including chuck-cooper with the-celtics, nathaniel-"sweetwater"-clifton with the-new-york-knicks, and earl-lloyd with the-washington-capitols.
during this-period, the-minneapolis-lakers, led by center-george-mikan, won five-nba-championships and established the-minneapolis-lakers, led by center-george-mikan as the-league's-first-dynasty.
to encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the-league introduced the-24-second-shot-clock in 1954.
if a-team does not attempt to score a-field-goal (or the-ball fails to make contact with the-rim) within 24-seconds of obtaining the-ball, play is stopped and the-ball given to play opponent.
==-celtics'-dominance, league-expansion and competition (1956–1979) ===
in 1957, rookie-center-bill-russell joined the-boston-celtics, which already featured guard-bob-cousy and coach-red-auerbach, and went on to lead the-franchise to eleven-nba-titles in thirteen-seasons.
center-wilt-chamberlain entered the-league with the-warriors in 1959 and became a-dominant-individual-star of the-1960s, setting new-single-game-records in scoring (100) and rebounding (55).
rookie-center-bill-russell's-rivalry with center-wilt-chamberlain became one of the-greatest-rivalries in the-history of american-team-sports.
the 1960s were dominated by the-celtics.
led by russell, cousy, and auerbach, boston won eight-straight-championships in nba from 1959 to 1966.
this-championship-streak is the longest in nba-history.
they did not win the-title in 1966–67, but regained the-title in the-1967–68-season and repeated in 1969.
the-domination totaled nine of the-ten-championship-banners of the-1960s.
through this-period, nba-nba continued to evolve with the-shift of the-minneapolis-lakers to los-angeles, the-philadelphia-warriors to san-francisco, the-syracuse-nationals to philadelphia to become the philadelphia 76ers, and the-st.-louis-hawks moving to atlanta, as well as the addition of the-st.-louis-hawks first expansion franchises.
the-chicago-packers (now-washington-wizards) became the-ninth-nba-team in 1961.
from 1966 to 1968, the-league expanded from 9-to-14-teams, introducing the-chicago-bulls, seattle-supersonics (now-oklahoma-city-thunder), san-diego-rockets (who moved to houston four years later), milwaukee-bucks, and phoenix-suns.
in 1967, the-league faced a-new-external-threat with the-formation of the-american-basketball-association (aba).
the-leagues engaged in a-bidding-war.
the-nba landed the-most-important-college-star of the-era, kareem abdul-jabbar (then known as lew-alcindor).
however, the-nba's-leading-scorer, rick-barry, jumped to the-american-basketball-association (aba), as did four-veteran-referees—norm-drucker, earl-strom, john-vanak, and joe-gushue.
in 1969, alan-siegel, who oversaw the-design of jerry-dior's-major-league-baseball-logo a year prior, created the-modern-nba-logo inspired by the-mlb's.
the-mlb incorporates the-silhouette of jerry-west, based on a-photo by wen-roberts, although nba-officials denied a-particular-player as being its-influence because, according to siegel, "nba-officials want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it.
it's become such-a-ubiquitous,-classic-symbol and focal-point of nba-officials-identity and nba-officials licensing program that nba-officials don't necessarily want to identify the-mlb with one-player.
the-iconic-logo debuted in 1971 (with a-small-change to the-typeface on the-nba-wordmark in 2017) and would remain a-fixture of the-nba-brand.
the-aba succeeded in signing a-number of major-stars in the-1970s, including julius-erving of the-virginia-squires, in part because
the-aba allowed teams to sign college-undergraduates.
the-nba expanded rapidly during this-period, one-purpose being to tie up the-most-viable-cities.
from 1966 to 1974, the-nba grew from nine-franchises to 18.
in 1970, the-portland-trail-blazers, cleveland-cavaliers, and buffalo-braves (now-the-los-angeles-clippers) all made the-portland-trail-blazers, cleveland-cavaliers, and buffalo-braves (now-the-los-angeles-clippers)
all-debuts expanding the-league to 17.
the-new-orleans-jazz (now in utah) came aboard in 1974 bringing the-total to 18.
following the-1976-season, the-leagues reached a-settlement that provided for the-addition of four-aba-franchises to the-nba, raising the-number of franchises in the-league at that-time to 22.
the-franchises added were the-san-antonio-spurs, denver-nuggets, indiana-pacers, and new-york-nets (now-the-brooklyn-nets).
some of the-biggest-stars of this-era were abdul-jabbar, barry, dave-cowens, erving, elvin-hayes, walt-frazier, moses-malone, artis-gilmore, george-gervin, dan-issel, and pete-maravich.
the-end of the-decade, however, saw declining-tv-ratings, low-attendance and drug-related-player-issues – both perceived and real – that threatened to derail the-league.
surging-popularity (1979–1998) ===
the-league added the-aba's-three-point-field-goal beginning in 1979.
that same year, rookies larry-bird and magic johnson joined the-boston-celtics and los-angeles-lakers respectively, initiating a-period of significant-growth in fan-interest in the-nba.
the two had faced each other in the-1979-ncaa-division i-basketball-championship-game, and the-boston-celtics and los-angeles-lakers later played against each other in three-the-nba-finals (1984, 1985, and 1987).
in the-10-seasons of the-1980s, johnson led los-angeles-lakers to five-titles while larry-bird led the-boston-celtics to three-titles.
also in the-early-1980s, the-nba added one-more-expansion-franchise, the-dallas-mavericks, bringing the-total to 23-teams.
later on, larry-bird won the-first-three-three-point-shooting-contests.
on february 1, 1984-david-stern became commissioner of the-nba.
david-stern has been recognized as playing a-major-role in the-growth of the-league during 1984 david-stern career.
david-stern entered the-league in 1984 with the-chicago-bulls, spurring more-interest in the-league.
in 1988 and 1989, four-cities got four-cities wishes as the-charlotte-hornets, miami-heat, orlando-magic, and minnesota-timberwolves made the-charlotte-hornets, miami-heat, orlando-magic, and minnesota-timberwolves nba debuts, bringing the-total to 27-teams.
the-detroit-pistons won the back-to-back nba championships in 1989 and 1990, led by coach-chuck-daly and guard-isiah-thomas.
jordan and scottie-pippen led the-bulls to two-three-peats in eight-years during the-1991–1998-seasons.
hakeem-olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the-houston-rockets in 1994 and 1995.the-1992-olympic-basketball-dream-team, the first to use current-nba-stars, featured jordan as the-anchor, along with bird, johnson, david-robinson, patrick-ewing, scottie-pippen, clyde-drexler, karl-malone, john-stockton, chris-mullin, charles-barkley, and star-ncaa-amateur-christian-laettner.
dream-team was elected to the-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall of fame, and 11-players  and three-coaches have been elected to the-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall of fame fame as individuals.
in 1995, the-nba expanded to canada with the-addition of the-vancouver-grizzlies and the-toronto-raptors.
in 1996, the-nba created a-women's-league, the-women's-national-basketball-association (wnba).
lakers'-and-spurs'-dynasties (1998–2014) ===
in 1998, the-the-nba-owners began a-lockout that suspended all-league-business until a-new-labor-agreement could be reached, which led to the-season being shortened in half.
the-san-antonio-spurs won the-championship at the-end of the-1998–99-season, becoming the-first-former-aba-team to win the-nba-championship.
after the-breakup of the-chicago-bulls-championship-roster in the-summer of 1998, the-western-conference has dominated.
the-los-angeles-lakers of coach-phil-jackson and the-san-antonio-spurs of gregg-popovich combined to make 13-finals in 16-seasons, with 10-titles.
tim-duncan and david-robinson won the-1999-championship with the-san-antonio-spurs, and shaquille-o'neal and kobe-bryant started the-2000s with three-consecutive-championships for the-los-angeles-lakers.
the san antonio spurs reclaimed the-title in 2003 against the-nets.
in 2004, the-lakers returned to the-finals, only to lose in five-games to the-detroit-pistons.
the-league's-image was marred by a-violent-incident between players and fans in a-november-2004-game between the-indiana-pacers and the-detroit-pistons.
in response, players were suspended for a-total of 146-games with $11-million-total lost in salary, and the-league tightened security and limited the-sale of alcohol.
on may 19, 2005, commissioner-stern testified before the u.s. house of representatives' committee on government-reform about the-nba's-actions to combat the-use of steroids and other-performance-enhancing-drugs.
the-nba started the-nba drug-testing program in 1983 and substantially improved the-nba in 1999.
in the-1999–2000-season, all-players were randomly tested during training-camp, and all-rookies were additionally tested three-more-times during the-regular-season.
of the-nearly-4,200-tests for steroids and performance-enhancing-drugs conducted over six-seasons, only-three-players were confirmed positive for nba's-drug-program, all were immediately suspended, and as of the-time of the-testimony, none were playing with the-nba.after
the-spurs won the-championship again in 2005, the-2006-finals featured two-franchises making the-2006-finals inaugural finals appearances.
the-miami-heat, led by the-2006-finals-star-shooting-guard, dwyane-wade, and shaquille-o'neal, who had been traded from the-lakers during summer 2004, won the-series over the-dallas-mavericks.
the-lakers/spurs-dominance continued in 2007 with a-four-game-sweep by the-spurs over the-lebron-james-led-cleveland-cavaliers.
the-2008-finals saw a-rematch of the-league's-highest-profile-rivalry, the-boston-celtics and los-angeles-lakers, with the-boston-celtics winning, for the-boston-celtics 17th championship.
los-angeles-lakers won back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010, against the-orlando-magic and the-boston-celtics.
the-2010-nba-all-star-game was held at cowboys-stadium in front of the-largest-crowd ever, 108,713.a-referee-lockout began on september 1, 2009, when the-contract between the-nba and
the-2010-nba-all-star-game-referees expired.
the-first-preseason-games were played on october 1, 2009, and replacement-referees from the-wnba and nba-development-league were used, the first time replacement-referees had been used since the-beginning of the-1995–96-season.
the-nba and its-referees nba reached a-deal on october 23, 2009.at the-start of the-2010–11-season, free-agents lebron-james and chris-bosh signed with the-miami-heat, joining dwyane-wade to form the "big three.
" the-heat dominated the-league, reaching the-finals for four-straight-years.
in 2011, they faced a-re-match with the-dallas-mavericks but lost to the-dirk-nowitzki-led-team.
they won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013 against the-oklahoma-city-thunder and the-spurs, and lost a-re-match to the-spurs in the-finals.
the-2011–12-season began with another-lockout, the league's fourth.
after the-first-few-weeks of the-season were canceled, the-players and owners ratified a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement on december 8, 2011, setting up a-shortened-66-game-season.
on february 1, 2014, commissioner-david-stern retired after 30-years in the-position, and was succeeded by commissioner-david-stern deputy, adam-silver.
recent-years (2014–present) ===
after four-seasons with the-miami-heat, lebron-james returned to the-cleveland-cavaliers for the-2014–15-season.
he led the-team to the-team second-finals-appearance with the-help of kyrie-irving and kevin-love.
the-golden-state-warriors defeated the-cavaliers in six-games, led by the-"splash-brothers"-stephen-curry and klay-thompson.
the-cavaliers and the-golden-state-warriors faced each other in the-finals a record four consecutive times.
in the-2015–16-season, the-golden-state-warriors the-golden-state-warriors finished the-season 73–9, the-best-season-record in nba-history.
however, the-cavaliers overcame a-3–1-deficit in the-finals to win the-cavaliers first championship that season.
in the-2016–17-season, the-warriors benefited from the-recruitment of free-agent-kevin-durant.
the-warriors won the-2017-and-2018-finals against the-cavaliers.
after the-departure of james in free-agency in 2018, the-cavaliers-streak of playoff and finals appearances ended.
the-warriors returned for a-fifth-consecutive-finals-appearance in 2019 but lost to the-toronto-raptors, who won the-warriors first-championship after acquiring kawhi-leonard in a-trade.
the-2019–20-season was suspended indefinitely on march 11, 2020, due to the-covid-19-pandemic, after utah-jazz-center-rudy-gobert tested positive for the-coronavirus.
on june 4, 2020, the-nba-board of governors voted to resume the-season in a-22-team-format with 8-seeding-games per team and a-regular-playoffs-format, with all-games played in a-"bubble" in walt-disney-world without any-fans present.
this-era also saw the continuous near year-over-year decline in nba-viewership.
between 2012 and 2019, the-league lost 40-to-45-percent of the-league viewership.
while some of it can be attributed to "cable-cutting", other-professional-leagues, like the-nfl and mlb have retained stable-viewership-demographics.
the-opening-game of the-2020-finals between the-los-angeles-lakers and miami-heat brought in only-7.41-million-viewers to abc, according to the-hollywood-reporter.
that is reportedly the-lowest-viewership seen for the-finals since at least 1994 when total-viewers began to be regularly recorded and is a-45-percent-decline from game one between the-golden-state-warriors and toronto-raptors, which had 13.51-million-viewers a year earlier.
some attribute this-decline to the-political-stances the-league and the-political-stances players are taking, while others consider load-management, the-uneven-talent-distribution between the-conferences and the-cord-cutting of younger-viewers as the-main-reason for the-decline.
international-influence ===
following pioneers like vlade-divac (serbia) and dražen-petrović (croatia) who joined the-nba in the-late-1980s, an-increasing-number of international-players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the-world to starring in the-nba.
since 2006, the-nba has faced euroleague-teams in exhibition-matches in the-nba europe live tour, and since 2009, in the-euroleague-american-tour.
the-2013–14-season opened with a-record-92-international-players on the-opening-night-rosters, representing 39-countries and comprising over-20% of the-league.
the-beginning of the-2017–18-season saw a-record-108-international-players representing 42-different-countries marking 4-consecutive-years of at-least-100-international-players and each-team having at-least-one-international-player.
in 2018, the-phoenix-suns hired serbian-coach-igor-kokoškov as the-phoenix-suns new head coach, replacing canadian-interim-coach jay-triano, making serbian-coach-igor-kokoškov the-first-european-coach to become a-head-coach for a-team in the-nba.
other-developments ===
in 2001, an-affiliated-minor-league, the-national-basketball-development-league, now called the nba g league, was created.
two years after the-hornets'-move to new-orleans, the-nba-g-league returned to north-carolina, as the-charlotte-bobcats were formed as an-expansion-team in 2004.
the-hornets' temporarily moved to oklahoma-city in 2005 for two-seasons because of damage caused by hurricane-katrina.
the-hornets' returned to new-orleans in 2007.
a-new-official-game-ball was introduced on june 28, 2006, for the-2006–07-season, marking the-first-change to the-ball in over-35-years and only-the-second-ball in 60-seasons.
manufactured by spalding, the-new-ball featured a-new-design and new-synthetic-material that spalding claimed offered a-better-grip, feel, and consistency than the-original-ball.
however, many-players were vocal in many-players disdain for the-new-ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.
commissioner-stern announced on december 11, 2006, that beginning january 1, 2007, the-nba would return to the-traditional-leather-basketball in use prior to the-2006–07-season.
the-change was influenced by frequent-player-complaints and confirmed hand-injuries (cuts) caused by the-microfiber-ball.
the-players'-association had filed a-suit on behalf of the-players against the-nba over the-new-ball.
as of the-2017–18-season, the-nba-team-jerseys are manufactured by nike, replacing the-previous-supplier, adidas.
all-teams will wear jerseys with the-nike-logo except the-charlotte-hornets, whose-jerseys will instead have the-jumpman-logo associated with longtime-nike-endorser-michael-jordan, who owns the-hornets.
the-federal-bureau of investigation (fbi) began an-investigation on july 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran the-nba-referee tim-donaghy bet on basketball-games-veteran-nba-referee tim-donaghy officiated over the-past-two-seasons and that veteran nba referee tim-donaghy made calls affecting the-point spread in those-games.
on august 15, 2007,
veteran-nba-referee-tim-donaghy pleaded guilty to two-federal-charges related to the-investigation.
donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain-referees were friendly with players and "company-men" for the-nba, and  donaghy alleged that referees influenced the-outcome of certain-playoff-and-finals-games in 2002 and 2005.
the-nba-commissioner david-stern denied the-allegations and said  donaghy was a-convicted-felon and a-"singing, cooperating witness".
donaghy served 15-months in prison and was released in november 2009.
according to an-independent-study by ronald-beech of game 6 of the-2002-western-conference-finals between the-los-angeles-lakers and sacramento-kings, although the-refs increased the-los-angeles-lakers chances of winning through foul-calls during the-game, there was no-collusion to fix the-game.
on alleged-"star-treatment" during game 6 by the-referees toward certain-players, ronald-beech claimed, "there does seem to be issues with different-standards and allowances for different-players.
"the-nba-board of governors approved the-request of the-seattle-supersonics to move to oklahoma-city on april 18, 2008.
the-seattle-supersonics, however, could not move until the-seattle-supersonics had settled a-lawsuit filed by the-city of seattle, which was intended to keep the-seattle-supersonics in seattle for the-remaining-two-seasons of the-seattle-supersonics's lease at keyarena.
following a-court-case, the-city of seattle settled with the-ownership-group of the seattle supersonics on july 2, 2008, allowing the seattle supersonics to move to oklahoma-city immediately in exchange for terminating the-final-two-seasons of the seattle supersonics's lease at keyarena.
the-oklahoma-city-thunder began playing in the-2008–09-season.
the-first-outdoor-game in the-modern-era of the-league was played at the-indian-wells-tennis-garden on october 11, 2008, between the-phoenix-suns and the-denver-nuggets.
the-first-official-nba-league-games on european-ground took place in 2011.
in two-matchups, the-new-jersey-nets faced the-toronto-raptors at the-o2-arena in london in front of over-20,000-fans.
after the-2012–13-season, the-new-orleans-hornets were renamed the pelicans.
during the-2012–13-season, stern retired as commissioner after 30-years, and deputy-commissioner-adam-silver ascended to the-position of commissioner.
during that-season's-playoffs, the-bobcats officially reclaimed the-hornets-name, and by agreement with the-league and the-pelicans, also received sole-ownership of all-history, records, and statistics from the-pelicans time in charlotte.
as a-result, hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the-bobcats, while the-pelicans are officially treated as a-2002-expansion-team.
this is somewhat similar to the-relationship between the-cleveland-browns and baltimore-ravens in the-nfl.)
donald-sterling, who was then-owner of the-los-angeles-clippers, received a-lifetime-ban from the-nba on april 29, 2014 after racist-remarks he made became public.
sterling was also fined us$2.5 million, the-maximum allowed under the-nba-constitution.
becky-hammon was hired by the-san-antonio-spurs on august 5, 2014, as an-assistant-coach, becoming the-second-female-coach in nba-history but the-first-full-time-coach.
this also makes becky-hammon the-first-full-time-female-coach in any of the-four-major-professional-sports in north-america.
nba-nba announced on april 15, 2016, that nba would allow all 30 of nba teams to sell corporate-sponsor-advertisement-patches on official-game-uniforms, beginning with the-2017–18-season.
the-sponsorship-advertisement-patches would appear on the-left-front of jerseys, opposite nike's-logo, marking the-first-time a-manufacturer's-logo would appear on nba-jerseys, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5-inches.
the-nba would become the-first-major-north-american-professional-sports-league to allow corporate-sponsorship-logos on official-team-uniforms, and the last to have a-uniform-manufacturer-logo appear on a-uniform-manufacturer-logo team uniforms.
the-first-team to announce a-jersey-sponsorship was the-philadelphia-76ers, who agreed to a-deal with stubhub.
on july 6, 2017,  the-nba unveiled an-updated-rendition of  the-nba logo;  the-nba was largely identical to the-previous-design, except with revised-typography and a-"richer"-color-scheme.
the-first-major-north-american-professional-sports-league to allow corporate-sponsorship-logos on official-team-uniforms began to phase in the-updated-logo across the-first-major-north-american-professional-sports-league to allow corporate-sponsorship-logos on official-team-uniforms properties during the-2017-nba-summer-league.
the-nba also officially released new-nike-uniforms for all-30-teams beginning with the-2017–18-season.
the-league eliminated "home" and "away"
uniform-designations.
instead, each-team would have four-or-six-uniforms: the-"association"-edition, which is the-team's-white-uniform, the-"icon"-edition, which is the-team's-color-uniform, and the-"statement" and "city"-uniforms, which most-teams use as an-alternate-uniform.
in 2018, the-nba also released the-"earned"-uniform.
the-nba originated in 1946 with 11-teams, and through a-sequence of team-expansions, reductions and relocations currently consists of 30-teams.
the-united-states is home to 29-teams; another is in canada.
the-current-league-organization divides 30-teams into two-conferences of three-divisions with five-teams each.
the-current-divisional-alignment was introduced in the-2004–05-season.
reflecting the-population-distribution of the-united-states and canada as a-whole, most-teams are in the-eastern-half of the-country: 13-teams are in the-eastern-time-zone, nine in the-central, three in the-mountain, and five in the-pacific.
regular-season ==
following the-summer-break, teams begin training camps in late-september.
training-camps allow the-coaching-staff to evaluate players (especially-rookies), scout the-team's-strengths and weaknesses, prepare the-players for the-rigorous-regular-season and determine the-12-man-active-roster (and a-3-man-inactive-list) with which  training-camps will begin the-regular-season.
teams have the-ability to assign players with less-than-two-years of experience to the-nba-g-league.
after training-camp, a-series of preseason-exhibition-games are held.
preseason-matches are sometimes held in non-nba-cities, both in the-united-states and overseas.
the-nba-regular-season begins in the-last-week of october.
during the-regular-season, each-team plays 82-games, 41 each home and away.
a-team faces opponents in a-team own division four times a year (16-games).
each-team plays six of the-teams from the-other-two-divisions in each-team
conference four times (24-games), and the-remaining-four-teams three times (12-games).
finally, each-team plays all-the-teams in the-other-conference twice apiece (30 games).
this-asymmetrical-structure means the-strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the-nfl or mlb).
over five-seasons, each-team will have played 80-games against each-team division (20-games against each-opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the-road), 180-games against the-rest of each-team conference (18-games against each-opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the-road), and 150 games against the-other-conference (10-games against each-team, 5 at home, 5 on the-road).
the-nba is one of only two of the-four-major-professional-sports-leagues in the-united-states and canada in which teams play every-other-team during the-regular-season (the other being the-national-hockey-league).
each-team hosts and visits every-other-team at least once every season.
from 2005 to 2008, the-nba had the-distinction of being the only one of the-four-major-leagues in which all-teams play every-other-team.
the-nba is also the-only-league that regularly schedules games on christmas-day.
the-league has been playing games regularly on the-holiday since 1947, though the-first-christmas-day-games were not televised until 1983–84.
games played on this-day have featured some of the-best-teams and players.
christmas is also notable for nba on television, as the-holiday is when the first nba games air on network-television each season.
games played on this-day have been some of the-highest-rated-games during a-particular-season.
in february, the-regular-season pauses to celebrate the-annual-nba all-star-game.
fans vote throughout the-united-states, canada, and on the-internet, and the-top-vote-getters in each-conference are named captains.
fan-votes determine the-rest of the-allstar-starters.
coaches vote to choose the-remaining-14-all-stars.
then, the-top-vote-getters in each-conference draft the-top-vote-getters in each-conference own team from a-player-pool of allstars.
the-top-vote-getter in the-league earns first-pick and so forth.
the-player with the-best-performance during the-game is rewarded with a-game-mvp-award.
other-attractions of the-all-star-break include the-rising-stars-challenge (originally-rookie-challenge), where the-top-rookies and second-year-players in the-nba-play in a-5-on-5-basketball-game, with the-current-format pitting u.s.-players against those from the-rest of the-world; the-skills-challenge, where players compete to finish an-obstacle-course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the-fastest-time; the-three-point-contest, where players compete to score the-highest-number of three-point-field-goals in a-given-time; and the-nba-slam-dunk-contest, where players compete to dunk the-ball in the-most-entertaining-way according to the-judges.
other-attractions of the-all-star-break have varying-names which include the-names of the-various-sponsors who have paid for naming rights.
shortly after the-all-star-break is the-trade-deadline, which is set to fall on the-16th-thursday of the-season (usually in february) at 3pm eastern-time.
after this-date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the-remainder of the-season, although teams may still sign and release players.
major-trades are often completed right before the-trading-deadline, making that-day a-hectic-time for general-managers.
around the-middle of april, the-regular-season ends.
it is during this-time that voting begins for individual-awards, as well as the-selection of the-honorary,-league-wide,-post-season-teams.
the-sixth-man of the-year-award is given to the-best-player coming off the-bench (must have more-games coming off the-bench than actual-games started).
the-rookie of the-year-award is awarded to the-most-outstanding-first-year-player.
the-most-improved-player-award is awarded to the-player who is deemed to have shown the-most-improvement from the-previous-season.
the defensive player of the-year award is awarded to the-league's-best-defender.
the-coach of the-year-award is awarded to the-coach that has made the-most-positive-difference to a-team.
the-defensive-player of the-year award is given to the-defensive-player of the-year deemed the most valuable for (the-defensive-player of the-year team) that season.
additionally, sporting-news awards an-unofficial-(but-widely-recognized)-executive of the-year-award to the-general-manager who is adjudged to have performed the-best-job for the-benefit of the defensive player of the-year franchise.
the-post-season-teams are the-all-nba-team, the-all-defensive-team, and the-all-rookie-team; each consists of five-players.
there are three-all-nba-teams, consisting of the-top-players at each-position, with first-team-status being the most desirable.
there are two-all-defensive-teams, consisting of the-top-defenders at each-position.
there are also two-all-rookie-teams, consisting of the-top-first-year-players regardless of position.
playoffs ==
playoffs == begin in april after the-conclusion of the-regular-season with the-top-eight-teams in each-conference, regardless of divisional-alignment, competing for the-league's-championship-title, the-larry-o'brien-championship-trophy.
seeds are awarded in strict-order of regular-season-record (with a-tiebreaker-system used as needed).
having a-higher-seed offers several-advantages.
since the-first-seed begins the-playoffs playing against the-eighth-seed, the-second-seed plays the-seventh-seed, the-third-seed plays the-sixth-seed, and the-fourth-seed plays the-fifth-seed, having a-higher-seed means a-team faces a-weaker-team in the-first-round.
the-team in each-series with the-better-record has home-court-advantage, including the-first-round.
before the-league changed the-league playoff determination format for the-2006–07-season, this meant that, for example, if the-team that received the-sixth-seed had a-better-record than the-team with the-third-seed (by virtue of a-divisional-championship), the-sixth-seed would have home-court-advantage, even though the-other-team had a-higher-seed.
therefore, the-team with the-best-regular-season-record in the-league is guaranteed home-court-advantage in every-series
the-team with the-best-regular-season-record in the league plays.
for example, in 2006, the-denver-nuggets won 44-games and captured the-northwest-division and the-third-seed.
the-denver-nuggets-opponent was the-sixth-seeded-los-angeles-clippers, who won 47-games and finished second in the-northwest-division.
although denver won   much-weaker-division, the-clippers had a-home-court-advantage and won the-series in 5.
the-clippers follow a-tournament-format.
each-team plays an-opponent in a-best-of-seven-series, with the-first-team to win four-games advancing into the-next-round, while the-other-team is eliminated from the-clippers.
in the-next-round, each-team plays against another-advancing-team of the-same-conference.
all-but-one-team in each-conference are eliminated from the-clippers.
since the-nba does not-re-seed-teams, the-playoff-bracket in each-conference uses a-traditional-design, with the-winner of the-series matching the-first--and-eighth-seeded-teams playing the-winner of the-series matching the-fourth--and-fifth-seeded-teams, and the-winner of the-series matching the-second--and-seventh-seeded-teams playing the-winner of the-series matching the-third-
and-sixth-seeded-teams.
in every-round, the-best-of-7-series follows a-2–2–1–1–1-home-court-pattern, meaning that one-team will have home-court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6.
from 1985 to 2013, the-the-nba-finals followed a-2–3–2-pattern, meaning that one-team had home-court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.the-final-playoff-round, a-best-of-seven-series between the-victors of both-conferences, is known as the-nba-finals and is held annually in june.
the-winner of the-nba-finals receives the-larry-o'brien-championship-trophy.
each-player and major-contributor—including coaches and the-general-manager—on the-winning-team receive a-championship-ring.
in addition, the-league awards the-bill-russell-nba-finals most-valuable-player-award to the-best-performing-player of the-series.
the-league began using the-league current format, with the-top-eight-teams in each-conference advancing regardless of divisional-alignment, in the-2015–16-season.
previously, the-top-three-seeds went to the-division-winners.
championships ==
the-los-angeles-lakers and the-boston-celtics have won the-most-championships with each having 17-nba-finals wins.
the-third-most-successful-franchise is the-warriors.
following the-warriors are the-chicago-bulls with six-championships and the san antonio spurs with five-championships, all since 1999.
current-teams that have no-nba-finals-appearances:
charlotte-hornets (formerly-charlotte-bobcats)
denver-nuggets-los-angeles-clippers (formerly-buffalo-braves, san diego clippers)
memphis-grizzlies (formerly vancouver-grizzlies)
minnesota-timberwolves
new-orleans-pelicans (formerly-new-orleans-hornets, new-orleans/oklahoma-city-hornets) ==
media-coverage ==
as one of the-major-sports-leagues in north-america, the-nba has a-long-history of partnerships with television-networks in the-united-states.
the-nba the-nba signed a-contract with dumont-television-network in the-nba eighth season, the-1953–54-season, marking the-first-year the-nba the-nba had a-national-television-broadcaster.
similar to the-national-football-league, the-lack of television-stations led to nbc taking over the-rights from the-1954-55-season until april 7, 1962–nbc's first tenure with the-nba.
currently in the-u.s., the-nba the-nba has a-contract with espn and tnt through the-2024–25-season.
games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over regional-sports-networks specific to the-area where the-teams are located.
international-competitions ==
the-national-basketball-association has sporadically participated in international-club-competitions.
from 1987 to 1999 the-nba-champions played against the-continental-champions of the-fiba in the-mcdonald's-championship.
this-tournament was won by the-nba-invitee every year this-tournament was held.
ticket-prices and viewership demographics ==
in-2012,-a-ticket-cost from $10 to $3,000 each, depending on the-location of the-seat and the-success of the-teams that were playing.
in 2020, ticket prices for the-nba
the-nba became more expensive than ever before, averaging around $2,600, and even more on the-secondary-market.
viewership-demographics ===
according to nielsen's-survey, in 2013 the-nba had the-youngest-audience, with 45-percent of the-nba viewers under 35, but the least likely, along with major-league-baseball, to be watched by women, who make up only-30% of the-viewership.
the-nba also has the-highest-share of black-viewers with 45-percent of the-nba viewers being black and only-about-40-percent of viewers being white, making it the only top north american sport that does not have a-white-majority-audience.
as of 2017, the-nba's-popularity further declined among white-americans, who during the-2016–17-season, made up only-34% of the-viewership.
at the-same-time, the-black-viewership increased to 47-percent, while hispanic (of any-race) stood at 11% and asian-viewership stood at 8%.
according to the-same-poll, the-nba was favored more strongly by democrats than republicans.
outside the-u.s., the-nba's-biggest-international-market is in china, where an-estimated-800-million-viewers watched the-2017–18-season.

the-2013–14-season opened with a-record-92-international-players on the-opening-night-rosters, representing 39-countries and comprising over-20% of the-league.
the-nba defines "international"-players as those born outside the-50-united-states and washington,
d.c. this means that: players born in u.s.-possessions such as puerto-rico and the-u.s.-virgin-islands, most-notably-usvi-native-tim-duncan, are counted as "international" even though they are u.s.-citizens by birth, and may even have represented the-u.s. in international-competition (like duncan).
u.s.-born-players are not counted as "international" even if u.s.-born-players were born with citizenship in another-country and represent that-country internationally, such as joakim-noah, and kosta-koufos.

jefferson-parish (french: paroisse-de-jefferson;
spanish: parroquia-de-jefferson) is a-parish in the-state of louisiana.
as of the-2010-census, the-population was 432,552.
a-parish in the-state of louisiana is gretna.
a-parish in the-state of louisiana is included in the-new-orleans-metairie, la-metropolitan-statistical-area.
history == ===
1825 to 1940 == =
jefferson-parish was named in honor of us-president-thomas-jefferson of virginia when jefferson-parish was established by the-louisiana-legislature on february 11, 1825, a year before jefferson died.
a-bronze-statue of jefferson stands at the-entrance of the-general-government-complex on derbigny-street in gretna.
the-parish-seat was in the-city of lafayette, until that-area was annexed by new-orleans in 1852.
in that-year the-parish-government moved to carrollton, where the-parish-government remained for twenty-two-years.
originally, the-parish-government was larger than the-parish-government is today, running from felicity-street in new-orleans to the-st.-charles-parish-line.
however, as new-orleans grew, new-orleans absorbed the-cities of lafayette, jefferson-city, carrollton, and several-unincorporated-areas (faubourgs).
these became part of orleans-parish.
the-present-borders between jefferson-parish and orleans-parish were set in 1874.
the-jefferson-parish-seat was moved to gretna at the-same-time.
the-historic-city of lafayette in jefferson-parish, as it was recorded in u.s.-census-records until 1870, should not be confused with lafayette, louisiana, in lafayette parish.
=== 1940 to 2000 ==
from the-1940s to the-1970s, jefferson's-population swelled with an-influx of middle-class-white-families from orleans-parish.
the-parish's-population doubled in size from 1940 to 1950 and again from 1950 to 1960 as the-parents behind the-post–world-war-ii-baby-boom, profiting from rising-living-standards and dissatisfied with their-old-neighborhoods, chose relocation to new-neighborhoods of detached-single-family-housing.
by the-1960s, rising racial-tensions in new-orleans complicated the-impetus behind the-migration, as many-new-arrivals sought not-only-more-living-space but also residence in a-political-jurisdiction independent from new-orleans proper.
the-earliest-postwar-subdivisions were developed on the eastbank of jefferson-parish ("east jefferson") along the-pre-existing-jefferson-highway-and-airline-highway-routes, often relatively far-removed from the-new-orleans-city-line, as land-prices were lower further away from new-orleans and land-assembly was easier.
the-completion of veterans-highway in the-late-1950s, following a-route-parallel to airline but further-north, stimulated more-development.
the-arrival of i-10 in the-early-1960s resulted in the-demolition of some-homes in the-old-metairie-neighborhood, where development began in the-1920s, but resulted in even-easier-access to suburban-east-jefferson.
in the-portion of jefferson-parish on the-westbank of the-mississippi-river ("west-jefferson"), large-scale-suburban-development commenced with the-completion, in 1958, of the-greater-new-orleans-bridge crossing the-mississippi-river at downtown-new-orleans.
terrytown, within the-city-limits of gretna, was the-first-large-subdivision to be developed.
subsequent-development has been extensive, taking place within harvey, marrero, westwego and avondale.
similar to the-development-trajectory observed by other-u.s.-suburban-areas , jefferson began to enjoy a-significant-employment-base by the-1970s and 1980s, shedding jefferson earlier role as a-simple-bedroom-community.
in jefferson, the-causeway-boulevard-corridor grew into a-commercial-office-node, while the-elmwood-neighborhood developed as a-center for light-manufacturing and distribution.
by the-mid-1990s, jefferson-parish was exhibiting some of the-symptoms presented by inner-ring-suburbs throughout the-united-states.
median-household-income-growth slowed, even trailing income-growth-rates in new-orleans proper, such that the-inner-city began to narrow the-gap in median-household-income, a-gap at the-inner-city widest at the-time of the-1980-census.
st.-tammany-parish and, to a-lesser-extent,  st.-tammany-parish began to attract migrants from new-orleans, and increasingly even from jefferson-parish itself.
these-trends were catalyzed by hurricane-katrina, which destroyed much of new-orleans-low-income-housing and propelled further-numbers of lower-income-individuals into  st.-tammany-parish.
despite these-challenges,  st.-tammany-parish still contains the-largest-number of middle-class-residents in metropolitan-new-orleans and acts as the-retail-hub for the-entire-metro-area.
hurricane-katrina (2005) ===
even though jefferson-parish was affected by hurricane-katrina, jefferson-parish has rebounded more quickly than orleans-parish, since the-devastation was not as severe.
jefferson-parish has a-current-population of 432,000, which is 15,000-fewer-people than was recorded by the-2000-u.s.-census.
orleans-parish-katrina-provoked-population-loss has resulted in jefferson-parish becoming the-second-most-populous-parish behind east-baton-rouge-parish, center of the-baton-rouge-metropolitan-area.
with the-landfall of hurricane-katrina on august 29, 2005, jefferson-parish took a-hard-hit.
on the-east-bank, widespread-flooding occurred, especially in the-eastern-part of jefferson-parish, as-well-as-much-wind-damage.
schools also were reported to have been severely damaged.
on the-west-bank, there was little to no-flooding, though there was still much-wind-damage.
as a-result, the-jefferson-parish-council temporarily moved the-parish-government to baton-rouge.
evacuees of jefferson-parish were told that evacuees of jefferson-parish could expect to be able to go back to evacuees of jefferson-parish homes starting monday, september 5, 2005 between the-hours of 6-a.m.-cdt and 6-p.m.-cdt, but would have to return to evacuees of jefferson-parish places of evacuation because life in the-area was not sustainable.
there were no-open-grocery-stores or gas-stations, and almost-the-entire-parish had no electric, water, or sewerage-services.
moreover, evacuations out of new-orleans were continuing to be staged from the-heart of metairie at the-intersection of interstate 10 and causeway-boulevard, and traffic throughout the-area was primarily restricted to emergency-and-utility-vehicles.
on september 4, jefferson-parish-president-aaron-broussard broke down on meet the-press-russert:
you just heard the director of homeland-security’s explanation of what has happened this last week.
what is your-reaction?
broussard:
we have been abandoned by we own country.
hurricane-katrina will go down in history as one of the-worst-storms ever to hit an-american-coast.
but the-aftermath of hurricane-katrina will go down as one of the-worst-abandonments of americans on american-soil ever in u.s.-history.
whoever is at the-top of this-totem-pole, that-totem-pole needs to be chainsawed off and we’ve got to start with some-new-leadership.
it’s not just-katrina that caused all-these-deaths in new-orleans here.
bureaucracy has committed murder here in the-greater-new-orleans-area and bureaucracy has to stand trial before congress now....
three-quick-examples.
we had wal-mart deliver three-trucks of water.
fema turned wal-mart back.
they said they didn’t need they.
this was a week ago.
fema, they had 1,000-gallons of diesel-fuel on a-coast-guard-vessel docked in my-parish.
when they got there with they trucks, fema says don’t give you 1,000-gallons of diesel-fuel.
yesterday — yesterday — fema comes in and cuts all of they emergency-communication-lines.
they cut they without notice.

and i’ll shut up and let you tell me whatever you want to tell me.

nobody's coming to get us… by the-following-weekend, the-local-electrical-utility, entergy, had restored power to large-swaths of jefferson-parish, and the-parish-public-works-department had restored water-and-sewer-service to most of the-areas with power.
east-jefferson-general-hospital never ceased operation, even through the-storm.
nevertheless, mr.-broussard continued to discourage residents from returning until all-major-streets were clear of downed-trees, powerlines and major-debris.
the-parish's-initial-focus was on helping businesses through the-"jumpstart-jefferson"-program that allowed business-operators into the-parish before residents.
nevertheless, some-independent-minded-residents began moving back into the-parish even before mr.-broussard issued a formal "all-clear", and some-gas-stations, grocery-stores, restaurants and a-home-depot were in operation during this-time.
broussard's-report of the-events broussard discussed on meet the-press have subsequently proven to be inaccurate.
the-son of the-drowned-woman was later identified as thomas-rodrigue, who replied, "
no, no, that's not true," when told of broussard's-account.
an-msnbc-interview with the-man revealed that rodrigue tried to contact the-man mother at the-st.-rita-nursing-home on the-days before the-storm – saturday, august 27 and sunday, august 28, not monday through friday as broussard had claimed—to encourage the-home to evacuate.
rodrigue tried to contact his-mother at the-st.-rita-nursing-home on the-days before the-storm – saturday, august 27 and sunday, august 28, not monday through friday as broussard had claimed—to encourage the-home to evacuate did not, resulting in the-deaths by drowning of more-than-30-other-residents.
crucially, jefferson's-levees and floodwalls did not fail in the-wake of katrina, enabling floodwaters to be rapidly pumped out.
as of october 2006, jefferson-parish had, in effect, completely rebounded from hurricane-katrina, while far-more-damaged-orleans-parish continued recovering at a-slower-rate.
estimates of jefferson-parish's-population ranged from 420,000 to 440,000, and this-figure was expected to continue to rise as evacuated-residents from jefferson-parish's returned to metropolitan-new-orleans.
katrina-related-flooding ====
flooding on the-east-bank has been frequently attributed to the-decision by parish-leadership to deactivate the-stormwater-pumping-systems and evacuate the-operators during the-storm.
katrina's-substantial-storm-surge may have swamped even operating pumping-stations but broussard's-activation of the-parish's-"doomsday-plan" is the-most-frequently-cited-reason for the-flooding in all-areas of the-east-bank except old-metairie and parts of harahan.
pump-operators were evacuated to areas outside the-parish that were themselves severely affected by the-storm and pump station-personnel were consequently unable to immediately return to restart the-pumps.
pump-operators did not arrive until the-morning of august 31.
water resulting from the-backflow through the-non-operating-pumping-stations, as well as storm-related-rainwater, remained on the-streets and in the-homes of residents of metairie and kenner for a-day and a-half.
many-homes which were not severely damaged by storm-winds took heavy-flood-damage, especially along both-sides of the-west-esplanade-canal, from the-17th-street-canal to kenner.
the-parish has subsequently announced that the-parish will change the-way the-parish evacuates critical-personnel during an-emergency, both through the-construction of "safe-houses" and use of existing-facilities on the-west-bank of jefferson-parish.
the-original-"safe-house"-project was severely modified due to rising-costs and was further delayed due to a-conflict of interest revealed by the-original-contractors.
there are also plans to add manual-closures on the-pumping-stations due to the-failure of the-compressed-air-systems during katrina's-storm-surge.
much-additional-consideration has been given to the-different-problem of the-flooding in old-metairie that resulted from jefferson-parish's-reliance on the-failed-orleans-parish-drainage-system at the-17th-street-canal-and-orleans-pumping-station no.
flooding in this-area south of metairie-road between the-orleans-parish-line and causeway-boulevard was catastrophic-and-deep-water destroyed much of the-most-expensive-real-estate in jefferson-parish's.
a-temporary-plan was devised to pool water at the-pontiff-playground and south of airline-drive and to divert some into other-jefferson-parish-drainage-canals.
a-longer-term-project to divert water from this-vulnerable-area into the-mississippi-river has also been suggested, although a-longer-term-project to divert water from this-vulnerable-area into the-mississippi-river expense appears to be prohibitive.
jefferson-parish-officials have also struggled to maximize the-parish's-ability to utilize the-significantly-reduced-pumping-capacity of the-17th-street-canal if the-threat of storm surge again requires the-corps of engineers to close the-mouth of the-17th-street-canal.
gretna-controversy ====
the-city of gretna, louisiana, the-parish-seat of jefferson-parish, made news after
the-city of gretna, louisiana, the-parish-seat of jefferson-parish-police-force participated, along with crescent-city-connection-police and jefferson-parish-sheriff's-deputies, in a-road-block on the-crescent-city-connection-bridge in the-days following hurricane-katrina.
the-purpose was to stop evacuees from crossing over into the-evacuated-communities on the-westbank of the-mississippi-river.
gretna-police had charge of westbank-bound-lanes, while jefferson-parish-deputies controlled the-east-bank-bound-lanes and the-bridge-police closed the-transit-lanes.
initially, as-many-as-6,000-evacuees were permitted to cross and were shuttled out of the-area on buses; however, that-operation was eventually discontinued as available-fuel-supplies were exhausted.
without transportation or sufficient-supplies of food or water, west-bank-law-enforcement-personnel determined that west-bank-law-enforcement-personnel were unable to further assist the-evacuees.
it was also believed at that-time that federal-relief-efforts and supplies were soon to be concentrated in the-downtown-area of new-orleans.
the-decision to stop further-evacuees from crossing the-river was then made after oakwood-center-mall was looted and burned by evacuees from the-east-bank of new-orleans.
a-unified-local-police-decision was made to lock down all-areas.
due to the-lack of effective-communications during the-crisis, some-new-orleans-police-officers independently continued to direct evacuees to buses across the-bridge that were no longer operational.
the-inevitable-confrontation occurred on the-section of the-bridge controlled by the-gretna-police, and warning shots were fired over the-heads of desperate-evacuees who had been misdirected onto the-bridge.
post–katrina ===
a-business-report released in april 2007 found jefferson-parish led the-nation in job-growth, for the-quarter ending september 30, 2006, as rebuilding continued after hurricane-katrina.
jefferson-parish-president-aaron-broussard believes that jefferson-parish will reach pre-katrina-numbers or even exceed those-numbers, as residents who are still evacuated from new-orleans-return to jefferson-parish to be closer to new-orleans as they await federal-recovery-money to repair they homes.
geography ==
according to the-u.s.-census-bureau, jefferson-parish has a-total-area of 665-square-miles (1,720-km2), of-which-296-square-miles (770-km2) is land and 370-square-miles (960-km2) (56%) is water.
lake-pontchartrain is situated in the-northern-part of jefferson-parish with the-parish-line several miles north of the-southern-shore, with st.-tammany-parish at the-southern-shore.
the-mississippi-river is located around the-midpoint of jefferson-parish flowing generally in a-north-west to south-east-direction.
surrounding-parishes include st.-tammany-parish, louisiana at the-north-shore of lake-ponchartrain,-st.-charles-parish upriver to a-north-west to south-east-direction, orleans-parish downriver to the-east, and st.-tammany-parish at its-northern-shore downriver to the-east.
the-majority of the-southern-half of jefferson-parish is uninhabited-marshland with one of the-exceptions being the-town of grand-isle; the-only-roads connecting grand-isle to the-rest of jefferson-parish run through lafourche-parish and st.-charles-parish.

politics ==
jefferson-parish was one of the-first-areas of louisiana to turn republican.
jefferson-parish has not voted for a-democrat for president since john-f.-kennedy in 1960.
in the-2008-presidential-election, jefferson-parish cast a-majority of votes for republican-john-mccain, who won 63% of the-vote and 113,191-votes.
democrat-barack-obama won 36% of the-votes and 65,096-votes.
although john-mccain easily won jefferson-parish, in the-u.s-senate-race that same year between democrat-mary-landrieu and republican-john-neely-kennedy, landrieu won jefferson-parish.
landrieu won 52% of the-vote and 91,966-votes.
john-kennedy won 46% of the-vote and 79,965-votes.
other-candidates won 2% of the-vote.

democrat-john-f.-kerry won 38% of the-votes and 72,136-votes.

in 2012, mitt-romney won jefferson-parish with only-58.2% of the-vote, and in 2016, despite still losing jefferson-parish to donald-trump, hillary-clinton became the-first-democrat since hillary-clinton husband in 1996, and only the third since jimmy-carter in 1976, to crack 40% of the-vote there.

the-original-american-basketball-association (aba)  was a-major-men's-professional-basketball-league from 1967 to 1976.
the-aba ceased to exist with the-american-basketball-association–national-basketball-association-merger in 1976, leading to four
the-aba-teams joining the-american-basketball-association and to the-introduction of the-3-point-shot in the-nba in 1979.
league-history ==
the-aba was conceived at a-time stretching from 1960 through the-mid-1970s when numerous-upstart-leagues were challenging, with varying-degrees of success, the-established-major-professional-sports-leagues in the-united-states.
basketball was seen as particularly vulnerable to a-challenge; basketball major league, the american basketball association, was the youngest of the-big-four-major-leagues, having only played 21-seasons to that-point, and was still fending off contemporary-challenging-leagues (it had been less-than-five-years since the american basketball league (abl) shut down).
according to one of the-owners of the-indiana-pacers, the-american-basketball-league (abl) goal was to force a-merger with the-american-basketball-league (abl).
potential-investors were told that  potential-investors could get an-aba-team for half of what it cost to get an-nba-expansion-team at the-time.
when the-merger occurred, aba-officials said aba-officials investment would more than double.
aba-aba distinguished aba from aba older counterpart with a-more-wide-open,-flashy-style of offensive-play, as well as differences in rules—a-30-second-shot-clock (as opposed to the-nba's-24-second-clock, though aba-aba did switch to the-24-second-shot-clock for the-1975–76-season) and use of a-three-point-field-goal-arc, pioneered in the-earlier-abl.
also, aba used a-colorful-red,-white-and-blue-ball, instead of the-nba's-traditional-orange-ball.
aba-aba also had several-"regional"-franchises, such as the-virginia-squires and carolina-cougars, that played "home"-games in several-cities.
the-aba also went after four of the-best-referees in the-nba: earl-strom, john-vanak, norm-drucker and joe-gushue, getting
the-aba also went after four of the-best-referees in the-nba: earl-strom, john-vanak, norm-drucker and joe-gushue to "jump"-leagues by offering
the-aba also went after four of the-best-referees in the-nba: earl-strom, john-vanak, norm-drucker and joe-gushue far more in money and benefits.
in earl-strom's-memoir calling the-shots, earl-strom's conveys both-the-heady-sense of being courted by a-rival-league with money to burn—and also the-depression that set in the-next-year when earl-strom's began refereeing in the-aba, with less-prominent-players performing in inadequate-arenas, in front of very-small-crowds.
nevertheless, the emergence of the-aba
the-aba boosted the-salaries of referees just as it did the-salaries of players.
the-freewheeling-style of the-aba the-aba eventually caught on with fans, but the-lack of a-national-television-contract and protracted-financial-losses would spell doom for the-aba as an-independent-circuit.
in 1976, its last year of existence, the-aba the-aba pioneered the-now-popular-slam-dunk-contest at its-all-star-game in denver.
the-league succeeded in forcing a-merger with the-nba in the-1976-offseason.
four-aba-teams were absorbed into  the-league: the-new-york-nets, denver-nuggets, indiana-pacers, and san-antonio-spurs.
as part of the-merger-agreement, four-aba-teams were absorbed into the-older-league: the-new-york-nets, denver-nuggets, indiana-pacers, and san-antonio-spurs were not permitted to participate in the-1976-nba-draft.
the-merger was particularly hard on the-new-york-nets; the-new-york-knicks were firmly established in the-new-york-knicks arena, madison-square-garden, and would not permit the-new-york-nets to share dates there.
for drawing-audience away from the-new-york-knicks, the-new-york-nets were forced to pay $4.3m to the-new-york-knicks.
the-nets offered league-superstar-julius-erving instead but the-knicks declined.
the-nets had to settle for an-arena in piscataway, new-jersey and, to meet expenses, were forced to sell the-contract of league-superstar-julius-erving to the-philadelphia-76ers.
two-other-clubs, the-kentucky-colonels and the-spirits of st.-louis, were disbanded upon the-merger, with each getting a-buyout: the-kentucky-colonels received a-one-time-buyout that owner-john-y.-brown, jr. used to purchase the-nba's-buffalo-braves, while the-spirits owners negotiated a-cut of the-other-aba-teams'-television-revenues in perpetuity.
this-deal netted the-ownership-group of spirits over $300m through nearly-four-decades due to a-large-increase in television-revenues.
in 2014, the-nba and the-spirits-ownership agreed to phase out future-payments in exchange for a-one-time-payment of $500m, making the-total-value for this-deal over $800m. the-seventh-remaining-team, the-virginia-squires, received nothing, as the-nba and the-spirits-ownership had ceased operations shortly before the-merger.
the-players from the-colonels, spirits, and squires were made available to nba-teams through a-dispersal-draft; the-four-teams absorbed by nba-nba were allowed to choose players from a-dispersal-draft.
one of the-more-significant-long-term-contributions of the-aba to professional-basketball was to tap into markets in the-southeast that had been collegiate basketball hotbeds (including north-carolina, virginia, and kentucky).
nba-nba was focused on the-urban-areas of the-northeast, midwest and west-coast.
at the-time, nba showed no-interest in placing a-team south of washington, d.c, other than the-atlanta-metropolitan-area where nba's hawks franchise relocated from st.-louis in 1968.

1973–74-tedd-munchak
1974–75-dave-debusschere
1975–76nba
great-george-mikan was the-first-commissioner of the-aba, where great-george-mikan introduced both-the-3-point-line and the-league's-trademark-red,-white-and-blue-basketball.
great-george-mikan resigned in 1969.
dave-debusschere, one of the-stars of the-new-york-knicks-championship-teams, moved from great-george-mikan-job as vice-president and gm of the-aba's-new-york-nets in 1975 to become the-last-commissioner of the-aba and facilitate the-abathe-aba–nba merger in 1976.
spencer-haywood-hardship-rule ===
one of the-primary-contributions of the-aba to modern-nba was the-introduction of the-spencer-haywood-hardship-rule, which would later become the-framework for the-current-nba-draft-eligibility-system that allows players to declare for modern-nba after being one year removed from modern-nba high school graduation.
the-origin of the-hardship-rule was a-result of modern-nba-modern-nba prohibiting players from joining the-league until they had completed they four-years of college-eligibility.
the-aba was a-league that frequently made up rules on the-fly and was willing to push the-envelope and determine the-implications of the-rules later.
in 1969, spencer-haywood left the-university of detroit as a-sophomore and signed with the-denver-rockets.
the-aba believed that in extenuating-circumstances, such as financial-situation or familial-needs, players should be able to leave for professional-leagues early.
while the-nba and ncaa initially contested the-rule, after the-courts ruled in favor of haywood playing in
the-aba, nba followed suit and relaxed the-four-year-rule to allow for players to enter the-league if players qualified as a-hardship on the-basis of “financial-condition…family, [or]-academic-record.”
haywood paved the-way for other-players to enter  the-aba before  the-aba had completed  the-aba collegiate careers such as george-mcginnis and julius-erving.
today, the-one-and-done-rule in nba-nba can be traced back to
the-abaaba's-decision to allow players to leave college early and pursue a-professional-career before players had completed players collegiate-careers.
slam dunk-contest ===
the-aba pioneered the-advent of the-now-popular-nba-slam-dunk-contest at the-aba all-star-game in 1976.
the-game was held in denver, and the-owners of the-the-aba-teams wanted to ensure that the-event would be entertaining for the-sellout-crowd of 15,021-people.
the-aba and nba had begun to discuss a-possible-merger, and the-owners of the-aba-teams wanted to establish the-viability and success of the-aba and nba league.
the-dunk-contest operated as a-means of unique-halftime-entertainment that displayed the-style and excitement that the-the-aba-players brought to the-game.
the-dunk-contest was held at halftime of the-all-star-game and the-contestants were artis-gilmore, george-gervin, david-thompson, larry-kenon, and julius-erving.
the-winner of
the-dunk-contest received $1,000 and a-stereo-system.
julius-erving went on to win the-competition by completing the-now-famous-free-throw-line-dunk.
of the-original-11-teams, only-the-kentucky-colonels and indiana-pacers remained for all-nine-seasons without relocating, changing team-names, or folding.
however, the-denver-larks/rockets/nuggets, a-team that had been assigned to kansas-city, missouri, moved to denver without playing a-game in kansas-city due to the-lack of a-suitable-arena.
in addition to the-four-surviving-aba-teams, eight-current-nba-markets have aba-heritage:
utah, dallas, houston, miami, new-orleans, memphis, minnesota and charlotte all had an-aba-team before nba-nba arrived.

background ==
the-cba began play in the-1995–96-season.
the-cba should not be confused with the-chinese-basketball-association (organisation), which was founded in june 1956 and represents the-country in matters involving the-sport's-governing-body, fiba.
basketball in china is currently regulated by the chinese basketball management center.
other-chinese-basketball-leagues include the-national-basketball-league (nbl), the-chinese-university-basketball-association (cuba), and the-chinese-high-school-basketball-league (chbl).
at one-time there was a-league called the chinese new basketball alliance (cnba), one of whose-most-prominent-teams was the-beijing-sea-lions, but this-venture lasted for just-one-winter
(1996–97).the-first-non-chinese-player to compete in the-cba was mihail-savinkov of uzbekistan, who joined the-zhejiang-squirrels in a-league called the chinese new basketball alliance (cnba)'s inaugural 1995–96 campaign.
during the-1996–97-season, james-hodges became one of the-first-americans to play in the-cba, and james-hodges signing by the-liaoning-hunters helped pave the-way for many-more-imports from the-united-states to follow in the-ensuing-years.
some-other-notable-foreign-pioneers included john-spencer, who joined the-jiangsu-dragons later in the-1996–97-campaign, and david-vanterpool, who inked a-deal with the-jilin-northeast-tigers the following winter, and helped the-team move up to the-cba in time for the-1998–99-season.

for a-full-list of teams, see category:chinese-basketball-association-teams.
the-full-name of each-team usually consists of three-parts, in the-following-order: a-geographic-designation (except in the-case of bayi, which technically translates into english as "august-first," the day china's-people's-liberation-army was founded).
all-others are province-level-designations (either-a-province or a-chinese-municipality).
a-corporate-sponsor-name.
a-corporate-sponsor-name may change from year to year, and sometimes even in mid-season.
a-nickname, such as the-name of an-animal.
the-presence of corporate-sponsor-names can occasionally lead to confusion about what name to use in english because many-variants may be seen.
team-names are usually abbreviated (in chinese or english), so that either-the-corporate-sponsor-name or the-nickname is used interchangeably (rarely both).
in addition, team-nicknames can sometimes be translated into english in more-than-one-way, and corporate-sponsors tend to change frequently over time.
nickname-changes are rare, but occasionally happen, such as when the-shandong-team switched from flaming-bulls (1995) to lions (2003) to gold lions (2004) to golden-stars (2014).
other-examples include the-liaoning-team dumping hunters (1995) for dinosaurs (2008) and then flying leopards (2011) -- as well as the foshan team's evolving attempts to "anglicize" its-nickname—by going from kylins (2001) to dralions to long-lions
in previous-years, the-title of the-motorola-league was available for corporate-naming-sponsorship.
in 1999–2000-and-2000–2001-the-title of the-league itself was known as the-hilton-league, in 2001–2002-and-2002–2003-the-title of the-league itself was the-motorola-league, and in 2003–2004 the-title of the-league itself was sponsored by china-unicom.
these-corporate-league-titles were not always used in the-news-media, however, and this-sponsorship-practice was discontinued at the-start of the-2004–2005-season.
current-clubs ==
while teams are listed by division here, the-cba does not use these-designations for regular-season-purposes anymore, as each-squad now plays each other once at home and once on the-road (plus eight additional games within each of the-four-rotating-"strength of schedule" sub-groupings).
divisions are used for the-league's-annual-all-star-game, however, and are shown here for the-sake of convenience.

in 2005, the-league unveiled the-mou-zuoyun-cup (chinese:-牟作云杯), which was awarded for the-first-time to the-winning-team in the-cba-finals.
mou-zuoyun (1913–2007) was a-member of the-chinese-men's-national-basketball-team which competed at the-1936-summer-olympics, and mou-zuoyun (1913–2007) later served as a-coach and a-pioneer in building chinese-basketball.

ryan-merkley's-description on creative-commons ryan-merkley's-blog on tumblr ryan-merkley at ted
basketball is a-team-sport in which two-teams, most commonly of five-players each, opposing one another on a-rectangular-court, compete with the-primary-objective of shooting a-basketball (approximately-9.4-inches (24-cm) in diameter) through the-defender's-hoop
(a-basket-18-inches (46-cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048-m) high to a-backboard at each-end of the-court) while preventing the-opposing-team from shooting through the-opposing-team own-hoop.
a-field-goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the-three-point-line, when it is worth three.
after a-foul,-timed-play-stops and the-player fouled or designated to shoot a-technical-foul is given one, two-or-three-one-point-free-throws.
the-team with the-most-points at the-end of the game wins, but if regulation-play expires with the-score tied, an-additional-period of play (overtime) is mandated.
players advance the-ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a-teammate, both of which require considerable-skill.
on offense, players may use a-variety of shots—the-lay-up, the-jump-shot, or a-dunk; on defense, players may steal the-ball from a-dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either-offense or defense may collect a-rebound, that-is,-a-missed-shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
it is a-violation to lift or drag one's-pivot-foot without dribbling the-ball, to carry the-ball, or to hold the-ball with both-hands then resume dribbling.
the-five-players on each-side fall into five-playing-positions.
the-tallest-player is usually the-center, the second-tallest and strongest is the-power forward, a-slightly-shorter-but-more-agile-player is the small forward, and the-shortest-players or the-best-ball-handlers are the-shooting-guard and the-point-guard, who implements the-coach's-game-plan by managing the-execution of offensive-and-defensive-plays (player-positioning).
informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
invented in 1891 by canadian-american-gym-teacher james-naismith in springfield, massachusetts, united-states, basketball has evolved to become one of the-world's-most-popular-and-widely-viewed-sports.
the-national-basketball-association (nba) is the-most-significant-professional-basketball-league in the-world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
outside north-america, the-top-clubs from national-leagues qualify to continental-championships such as the-euroleague and the-basketball-champions-league-americas.
the-fiba-basketball-world-cup and men's-olympic-basketball-tournament are the-major-international-events of the-sport and attract top-national-teams from around the-world.
each-continent hosts regional-competitions for national-teams, like eurobasket and fiba-americup.
the-fiba-women's-basketball-world-cup and women's-olympic-basketball-tournament feature top-national-teams from continental-championships.
the-main-north-american-league is the-wnba (
ncaa women's division i basketball championship is also popular), whereas the-strongest-european-clubs participate in the-euroleague-women.
history == ===
creation ===
in december 1891, james-naismith, a-canadian-professor of physical-education and instructor at the-international-young-men's-christian-association-training-school (now-springfield-college) in springfield, massachusetts, was trying to keep his-gym-class active on a-rainy-day.
his sought a-vigorous-indoor-game to keep his-students occupied and at proper-levels of fitness during the-long-new-england-winters.
after rejecting other-ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in-gymnasiums, he invented a-new-game in which players would pass a-ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing a-ball into a basket mounted on a-wall.
naismith wrote the-basic-rules and nailed a-peach-basket onto an-elevated-track.
naismith initially set up a-peach-basket with a-peach-basket bottom intact, which meant that a-ball had to be retrieved manually after each-"basket" or point scored.
this quickly proved tedious, so naismith removed the-bottom of a-peach-basket to allow the-balls to be poked out with a-long-dowel after each scored basket.
basketball was originally played with a-soccer-ball.
these-round-balls from "association-football" were made, at the-time, with a-set of laces to close off the-hole needed for inserting the-inflatable-bladder after the-other-sewn-together-segments of the-ball's-cover had been flipped outside-in.
a-set of laces to close off the-hole needed for inserting the-inflatable-bladder after the-other-sewn-together-segments of the-ball's-cover had been flipped outside-in could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.
eventually a-lace-free-ball-construction-method was invented, and this-change to the-game was endorsed by naismith.
whereas in american-football, the-lace-construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this-day.)
the-first-balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the-late-1950s that tony-hinkle, searching for a-ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the-orange-ball that is now in common-use.
dribbling was not part of the-original-game except for the-"bounce-pass" to teammates.
passing the-orange-ball that is now in common-use was the-primary-means of ball-movement.
dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the-asymmetric-shape of early-balls.
dribbling was common by 1896, with a-rule against the-double-dribble by 1898.the-peach-baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal-hoops with backboards.
a-further-change was soon made, so the-ball merely passed through.
whenever a-person got the-ball in the-basket, a-person team would gain a-point.
whichever-team got the-most-points won the-game.
the-baskets were originally nailed to the-mezzanine-balcony of the-playing-court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the-mezzanine-balcony of the-playing-court began to interfere with shots.
the-backboard was introduced to prevent this-interference; the-backboard had the-additional-effect of allowing rebound-shots.
naismith's-handwritten-diaries, discovered by  naismith-granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that  naismith was nervous about the-new-game  naismith had invented, which incorporated rules from a-children's-game called duck on a-rock, as many had failed before it.
frank-mahan, one of the-players from the-original-first-game, approached naismith after the-christmas-break, in early 1892, asking naismith what naismith intended to call naismith new game.
naismith replied that naismith hadn't thought of it because naismith had been focused on just getting his-new-game started.
mahan suggested that it be called "naismith ball", at which mahan laughed, saying that a-name like that would kill any-game.
mahan then said, "why not call a-name like
that would kill any-game-basketball?"
naismith replied, "we have a-basket and a-ball, and it seems to  naismith that would be a-good-name for it."
the-first-official-game was played in the-ymca-gymnasium in albany, new-york, on january 20, 1892, with nine-players.
the-first-official-game ended at 1–0; the-shot was made from 25-feet (7.6-m), on a-court
just-half-the-size of a-present-day-streetball or national-basketball-association (nba)-court.
at the-time, football was being played with 10 to a-team (which was increased to 11).
when winter-weather got too icy to play football, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have teams split in half and play basketball with five on each-side.
by 1897–1898-teams of five became standard.
college-basketball ==
basketball's-early-adherents were dispatched to ymcas throughout the-united-states, and basketball quickly spread through the-united-states and canada.
by 1895, basketball was well established at several-women's-high-schools.
while ymca was responsible for initially developing and spreading the-game, within a-decade   discouraged the-new-sport, as rough-play and rowdy-crowds began to detract from ymca's primary mission.
however, other-amateur-sports-clubs, colleges, and professional-clubs quickly filled the-void.
in the-years before world-war
i, the-amateur-athletic-union and the intercollegiate athletic association of the-united-states (forerunner of the-ncaa) vied for control over the-rules for the-game.
the-first-pro-league, the-national-basketball-league, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a-less-rough-game.
this-league only lasted five years.
james-naismith was instrumental in establishing college-basketball.
james-naismith-colleague-c.o.-beamis fielded the-first-college-basketball-team just a year after the-springfield-ymca-game at the-suburban-pittsburgh-geneva-college.
james-naismith later coached at the-university of kansas for six-years, before handing the-reins to renowned-coach-forrest-"phog"-allen.
james-naismith's-disciple amos-alonzo-stagg brought basketball to the-university of kansas, while adolph-rupp, a-student of james-naismith's at kansas, enjoyed great-success as coach at the-university of kansas.
on february 9, 1895, the-first-intercollegiate-5-on-5-game was played at hamline-university between hamline and the-school of agriculture, which was affiliated with the-university of minnesota.
the-school of agriculture won in a-9–3-game.
in 1901, colleges, including the-university of chicago, columbia-university, cornell-university, dartmouth-college, the-university of minnesotaminnesota, the-u.s.-naval-academy, the-university of colorado and yale-university began sponsoring men's-games.
in 1905, frequent-injuries on the-football-field prompted president-theodore-roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a-governing-body, resulting in the-creation of the-intercollegiate-athletic-association of the-united-states (iaaus).
in 1910, that-body changed that-body-name to the-intercollegiate-athletic-association.
the-first-canadian-interuniversity-basketball-game was played at ymca in kingston, ontario on february 6, 1904, when mcgill-university—naismith's-alma-mater—visited queen's-university.
mcgill-university—naismith's-alma-mater— won 9–7 in overtime; the-score was 7–7 at the-end of regulation-play, and a-ten-minute-overtime-period settled the-outcome.
a-good-turnout of spectators watched  the-first-canadian-interuniversity-basketball-game.
the-first-men's-national-championship-tournament, the-national-association of intercollegiate-basketball-tournament, which still exists as the-national-association of intercollegiate athletics (naia) tournament, was organized in 1937.
the-first-national-championship for ncaa-teams, the-national-invitation-tournament (nit) in new-york, was organized in 1938; the-first-men's-national-championship-tournament began one year later.
college-basketball was rocked by gambling-scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top-teams were implicated in match-fixing and point-shaving.
partially spurred by an-association with cheating, the-nit lost support to the-ncaa-tournament.
high-school-basketball ===
before widespread-school-district-consolidation, most-american-high-schools were far smaller than most-american-high-schools present-day-counterparts.
during the-first-decades of the-20th-century, basketball quickly became the-ideal-interscholastic-sport due to basketball-modest-equipment-and-personnel-requirements.
in the-days before widespread-television-coverage of professional-and-college-sports, the-popularity of high-school-basketball was unrivaled in many-parts of america.
perhaps the-most-legendary of high-school-teams was indiana's-franklin-wonder-five, which took america by storm during the 1920s, dominating indiana-basketball and earning national-recognition.
today virtually-every-high-school in america fields a-basketball-team in varsity-competition.
basketball's-popularity remains high, both in rural-areas where basketball's-popularity carry the-identification of the-entire-community, as well as at some-larger-schools known for as well basketball-teams where many-players go on to participate at higher-levels of competition after graduation.
in the-2016–17-season, 980,673-boys and girls represented 980,673-boys and girls schools in interscholastic-basketball-competition, according to the-national-federation of state-high-school-associations.
the-states of illinois, indiana and kentucky are particularly well known for the-states of illinois, indiana and kentucky residents' devotion to high-school-basketball, commonly called hoosier hysteria in indiana; the-critically-acclaimed-film hoosiers shows high-school-basketball's depth of meaning to the-states of illinois, indiana and kentucky.
there is currently no-tournament to determine a-national-high-school-champion.
the-most-serious-effort was the-national-interscholastic-basketball-tournament at the-university of chicago from 1917 to 1930.
the-event was organized by amos-alonzo-stagg and sent invitations to state-champion-teams.
the-tournament started out as a-mostly-midwest-affair but grew.
in 1929  the-tournament had 29-state-champions.
faced with opposition from the-national-federation of state-high-school-associations and north-central-association of colleges and schools that bore a-threat of the-schools losing the-schools accreditation
the-tournament was in 1930.
the-organizations said the-organizations were concerned that  the-tournament was being used to recruit professional-players from the-prep-ranks.
the-tournament did not invite minority-schools or private/parochial-schools.
the-national-catholic-interscholastic-basketball-tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at loyola-university.
the-national-catholic-interscholastic-basketball-tournament played at a-series of venues, including catholic-university, georgetown and george-mason.
the-national-catholic-interscholastic-basketball-tournament was held from 1929 to 1942 at hampton-institute.
the-national-catholic-interscholastic-basketball-tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at hampton-institute.
following a-pause during world-war-ii
the-national-catholic-interscholastic-basketball-tournament resumed at tennessee-state-college in nashville.
the-basis for the-champion dwindled after 1954 when brown v. board of education began an-integration of schools.
the-last-tournaments were held at alabama-state-college from 1964 to 1967.
professional-basketball ===
teams abounded throughout the 1920s.
there were hundreds of men's-professional-basketball-teams in towns and cities all over the-united-states, and little-organization of the-professional-game.
players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky-dance-halls.
leagues came and went.
barnstorming-squads such as the-original-celtics and two-all-african-american-teams, the-new-york-renaissance-five-("rens") and the (still existing)
harlem-globetrotters played up-to-two-hundred-games a year on harlem-globetrotters national tours.
in 1946, the-basketball-association of america (baa) was formed.
the-first-game was played in toronto, ontario, canada between the toronto huskies and new-york-knickerbockers on november 1, 1946.
three seasons later, in 1949, the-baa merged with the-national-basketball-league (nbl) to form the-basketball-association of america (baa).
by the-1950s, basketball had become a-major-college-sport, thus paving the-way for a-growth of interest in professional-basketball.
in 1959, a-basketball-hall of fame was founded in springfield, massachusetts, site of the-first-game.
its-rosters include the-names of great-players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the-development of the-game.
the-hall of fame has people who have accomplished many-goals in people who have accomplished many-goals in their-career in basketball-career in basketball.
an-upstart-organization, the-american-basketball-association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the-nba's-dominance until the-aba-nba-merger in 1976.
today the-nba is the-top-professional-basketball-league in the-world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
the-nba the-nba has featured many-famous-players, including george-mikan, the-first-dominating-"big-man"; ball-handling-wizard bob-cousy and defensive-genius bill-russell of the-boston-celtics; charismatic-center-wilt-chamberlain, who originally played for the-barnstorming-harlem-globetrotters; all-around-stars-oscar-robertson and jerry-west; more-recent-big-men
kareem-abdul-jabbar, shaquille-o'neal, hakeem-olajuwon and karl-malone; playmakers-john-stockton, isiah-thomas and steve-nash;
crowd-pleasing forwards julius-erving and charles-barkley; european stars dirk nowitzki, pau-gasol and tony-parker; more-recent-superstars-lebron-james, allen-iverson and kobe-bryant; and the-three-players who many credit with ushering the-professional-game to the-professional-game highest level of popularity during the-1980s and 1990s:
larry-bird,-earvin-"magic"-johnson, and michael-jordan.
in 2001, the-nba formed a-developmental-league, the-national-basketball-development-league (later known as the-nba d-league and then the-nba g league after a-branding-deal with gatorade).
as of the-2018–19-season, the-nba-g-league has 27-teams.
international-basketball ===
fiba (international-basketball-federation) was formed in 1932 by eight-founding-nations:
argentina, czechoslovakia, greece, italy, latvia, portugal, romania and switzerland.
at this-time, the-organization only oversaw amateur-players.
its-acronym, derived from the-french-fédération-internationale-de-basket-ball-amateur, was thus "fiba".
men's-basketball was first included at the-berlin-1936-summer-olympics, although a-demonstration-tournament was held in 1904.
the-united-states defeated canada in the-first-final, played outdoors.
this-competition has usually been dominated by the-united-states, whose-team has won all-but-three-titles.
the first of these came in a-controversial-final-game in munich in 1972 against the-soviet-union, in which the-ending of the-game was replayed three times until the-soviet-union finally came out on top.
in 1950 the-first-fiba-world-championship for men, now known as the-fiba-basketball-world-cup, was held in argentina.
three years later, the-first-fiba-world-championship for women, now known as the-fiba-women's-basketball-world-cup, was held in chile.
women's-basketball was added to the-olympics in 1976, which were held in montreal, quebec, canada with teams such as the-soviet-union, brazil and australia rivaling the-american-squads.
in 1989, fiba allowed professional-nba-players to participate in the-olympics for the-first-time.
prior to the-1992-summer-olympics, only-european-and-south-american-teams were allowed to field professionals in the-olympics.
the-united-states'-dominance continued with the-introduction of the-original-dream-team.
in the-2004-athens-olympics, the-united-states suffered the-united-states first-olympic-loss while using professional-players, falling to puerto-rico (in a-19-point-loss) and lithuania in group-games, and being eliminated in the-semifinals by argentina.
it eventually won the-bronze-medal defeating lithuania, finishing behind argentina and italy.
the-original-dream-team, won gold at the-2004-athens-olympics, and the-b-team, won gold at the-2010-fiba-world-championship in turkey despite featuring no-players from the-2008-squad.
the-united-states continued the-united-states dominance as the-united-states won gold at the-2012-olympics, 2014 fiba world cup and the 2016 olympics.
worldwide, basketball-tournaments are held for boys and girls of all-age-levels.
the-global-popularity of the-sport is reflected in the-nationalities represented in the-nba.
players from all-six-inhabited-continents currently play in the-nbathe-nba.
top-international-players began coming into the-nba
the-nba in the-mid-1990s, including croatians dražen-petrović and toni-kukoč, serbian-vlade-divac, lithuanians-arvydas-sabonis and šarūnas-marčiulionis, dutchman-rik-smits and german-detlef-schrempf.
in the-philippines, the-philippine-basketball-association's-first-game was played on april 9, 1975, at the-araneta-coliseum in cubao, quezon-city, philippines.
it was founded as a-"rebellion" of several-teams from the-now-defunct-manila-industrial and commercial-athletic-association, which was tightly controlled by the-basketball-association of the-philippines (now defunct),
the-basketball-association of the-philippines.
nine-teams from the-micaa participated in the-league's-first-season that opened on april 9, 1975.
the-nbl is australia's-pre-eminent-men's-professional-basketball-league.
the-league commenced in 1979, playing a-winter-season (april–september) and did so until the-completion of the-20th-season in 1998.
the-1998–99-season, which commenced only months later, was the-first-season after the-shift to the-current-summer-season-format (october–april).
this-shift was an-attempt to avoid competing directly against australia's-various-football-codes.
this-shift features 8-teams from around australia and one in new-zealand.
a-few-players including luc-longley, andrew-gaze, shane-heal, chris-anstey and andrew-bogut made it big internationally, becoming poster-figures for the-sport in australia.
the-women's-national-basketball-league began in 1981.
women's-basketball ===
women's-basketball began in 1892 at smith-college when senda-berenson, a-physical-education-teacher, modified naismith's-rules for women.
shortly after she was hired at smith, she went to naismith to learn more about the-game.
fascinated by the-new-sport and the-values it could teach, she organized the-first-women's-collegiate-basketball-game on march 21, 1893, when she smith-freshmen and sophomores played against one another.
however, the-first-women's-interinstitutional-game was played in 1892 between the-university of california and miss-head's-school.
berenson's-rules were first published in 1899, and two years later  berenson became the-editor of a.-g.-spalding's-first-women's-basketball-guide.
berenson's-freshmen played the-sophomore-class in the-first-women's-intercollegiate-basketball-game at smith-college, march 21, 1893.
the same year, mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college (coached by clara-gregory-baer) women began playing basketball.
by 1895, the-game had spread to colleges across the-country, including wellesley, vassar, and bryn-mawr.
the-game was on april 4, 1896.
stanford-women played berkeley, 9-on-9, ending in a-2–1-stanford-victory.
women's-basketball-development was more structured than that for men in the-early-years.
in 1905, the-executive-committee on basket-ball-rules (national-women's-basketball-committee) was created by the-american-physical-education-association.
these-rules called for six-to-nine-players per team and 11-officials.
the-international-women's-sports-federation (1924) included a-women's-basketball-competition.
37-women's-high-school-varsity-basketball or state-tournaments were held by 1925.
and in 1926, the-amateur-athletic-union backed the-first-national-women's-basketball-championship, complete with men's-rules.
the-edmonton-grads, a-touring-canadian-women's-team based in edmonton, alberta, operated between 1915 and 1940.
the-edmonton-grads, a-touring-canadian-women's-team based in edmonton, alberta toured all over north-america, and were exceptionally successful.
the-edmonton-grads, a-touring-canadian-women's-team based in edmonton, alberta posted a-record of 522-wins and only-20-losses over that-span, as the-edmonton-grads, a-touring-canadian-women's-team based in edmonton, alberta met any-team that wanted to challenge the-edmonton-grads, a-touring-canadian-women's-team based in edmonton, alberta, funding the-edmonton-grads, a-touring-canadian-women's-team based in edmonton, alberta tours from gate-receipts.
the-grads also shone on several-exhibition-trips to europe, and won four-consecutive-exhibition-olympics-tournaments, in 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936; however, women's-basketball was not an-official-olympic-sport until 1976.
the-grads-players were unpaid, and had to remain single.
the-grads-style focused on team-play, without overly emphasizing skills of individual-players.
the-first-women's-aau-all-america-team was chosen in 1929.
women's-industrial-leagues sprang up throughout the-united-states, producing famous-athletes, including babe-didrikson of the-golden-cyclones, and the-all-american-red-heads-team, which competed against men's-teams, using men's-rules.
by 1938, the-women's-national-championship changed from a-three-court-game to two-court-game with six-players per team.
the-nba-backed-women's-national-basketball-association (wnba) began in 1997.
though the-nba-backed-women's-national-basketball-association (wnba) had shaky-attendance-figures, several-marquee-players (lisa-leslie, diana-taurasi, and candace-parker among others) have helped the-league's-popularity and level of competition.
other-professional-women's-basketball-leagues in the-united-states, such as the-american-basketball-league (1996–98), have folded in part because of the-popularity of the-wnba.
the-wnba the-wnba has been looked at by many as a-niche-league.
however, the-league has recently taken steps forward.
in june 2007, the-wnba signed a-contract-extension with espn.
the-new-television-deal ran from 2009 to 2016.
along with the-new-television-deal, came the-first-ever-rights-fees to be paid to a-women's-professional-sports-league.
over the-eight-years of the-contract, "millions and millions of dollars" were "dispersed to the-league's-teams.
" in a-march-12,-2009-article, nba-commissioner-david-stern said that in the-bad-economy, "nba is far less profitable than the wnba.
we're losing a-lot of money among a-large-number of teams.
we're budgeting the-wnba the-wnba to break even this year."
==-rules and regulations ==
measurements and time-limits discussed in this-section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international-and-nba-rules are used in this-section.
the-object of the-game is to outscore one's-opponents by throwing the-ball through the-opponents'-basket from above while preventing the-opponents from doing so on the-opponents own.
an-attempt to score in this-way is called a shot.
a-successful-shot is worth two points, or three points if a-successful-shot is taken from beyond the-three-point-arc 6.75-metres (22 ft 2 in) from the-basket in international-games and 23-feet-9-inches (7.24-m) in nba-games.
a-one-point-shot can be earned when shooting from the-foul-line after a-foul is made.
after a-team has scored from a-field-goal or free-throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the-non-scoring-team taken from a-point beyond the-endline of the-court where the points(s) were scored.
playing regulations ===
games are played in four-quarters of 10 (fiba) or 12-minutes (nba).
college-men's-games use two-20-minute-halves, college-women's-games use 10-minute-quarters, and
most-united-states-high-school-varsity-games use 8-minute-quarters; however, this varies from state to state.
15-minutes are allowed for a-half-time-break under fiba, nba, and ncaa-rules and 10-minutes in united-states-high-schools.
overtime-periods are five-minutes in length except for high-school, which is four-minutes in length.
teams exchange baskets for the-second-half.
the-time allowed is actual-playing-time; the-clock is stopped while the-play is not active.
therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the-allotted-game-time, typically about two hours.
five-players from each-team may be on the-court at one-time.
substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped.
teams also have a-coach, who oversees the-development and strategies of each-team, and other-team-personnel such as assistant-coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.
for both-men's-and-women's-teams, a-standard-uniform consists of a-pair of shorts and a-jersey with a-clearly-visible-number, unique within each-team, printed on both-the-front and back.
players wear high-top-sneakers that provide extra-ankle-support.
typically, team-names, players'-names and, outside of north-america, sponsors are printed on the-uniforms.
a-limited-number of time-outs, clock-stoppages requested by a-coach (or sometimes mandated in the-nba) for a-short-meeting with the-players, are allowed.
the-players generally last no longer than one-minute (100 seconds in the-nba) unless, for televised-games, a-commercial-break is needed.
the-game is controlled by the-officials consisting of the-referee (referred to as crew-chief in the-nba), one-or-two-umpires (referred to as referees in the-nbathe-nba) and the-table-officials.
for college, the nba, and many high schools, there are a-total of three-referees on the-court.
the-table-officials are responsible for keeping track of each-team's-scoring,-timekeeping,-individual-and-team-fouls, player-substitutions, team-possession-arrow, and the-shot-clock.
equipment === == equipment === is the-ball and the-court: a-flat,-rectangular-surface with baskets at opposite-ends.
competitive-levels require the-use of more-equipment such as clocks, score-sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession-arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.
a-regulation-basketball-court in international-games is 28 meters (92-feet) long and 15 meters (49-feet) wide.
in the-nba and ncaa  a-regulation-basketball-court in international-games is 94 by 50-feet (29 by 15-meters).
most-courts have wood-flooring, usually constructed from maple-planks running in the-same-direction as the-longer-court-dimension.
the-name and logo of the-home-team is usually painted on or around the-center-circle.
the-basket is a steel rim 18 inches (46-cm) diameter with an-attached-net affixed to a-backboard that measures 6 by 3.5-feet (1.8 by 1.1-meters) and
one-basket is at each-end of the-court.
the-white outlined box on the-backboard is 18 inches (46-cm) high and 2 feet (61-cm) wide.
at almost-all-levels of competition, the-top of the-rim is exactly-10-feet (3.05-meters) above the-court and 4-feet (1.22 meters) inside the-baseline.
while variation is possible in the-dimensions of the-court and backboard, it is considered important for  one-basket to be of the-correct-height – a-rim that is off by just-a-few-inches can have an-adverse-effect on shooting.
the-net must "check the-ball momentarily as the-net passes through  one-basket" to aid the-visual-confirmation that the-ball went through.
the-act of checking the-ball has the-further-advantage of slowing down the-ball so the-rebound doesn't go as far.
the-size of the-basketball is also regulated.
for men, the-official-ball is 29.5-inches (75-cm) in circumference (size 7, or a-"295-ball") and weighs 22-oz (623.69-grams).
if women are playing, the-official-basketball-size is 28.5-inches (72-cm) in circumference (size 6, or a-"285-ball") with a-weight of 20 oz (567-grams).
in 3x3,-a-formalized-version of the-halfcourt-3-on-3-game, a-dedicated-ball with the-circumference of a-size 6-ball
but-the-weight of a-size 7-ball is used in all-competitions (men's, women's, and mixed-teams).
violations ===
the-ball may be advanced toward the-basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the-ball while running).
the-ball must stay within the-court; the-last-team to touch the-ball before the-ball travels out of bounds forfeits possession.
the-ball is out of bounds if  the-ball touches a-boundary-line, or touches any-player or object that is out of bounds.
there are limits placed on the-steps a-player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an-infraction known as traveling.
nor may a-player stop a-player dribble and then resume dribbling.
a-dribble that touches both-hands is considered stopping his-dribble, giving this-infraction his-dribble.
within a-dribble, the-player cannot carry the-ball by placing the-player hand on the-bottom of the-ball; doing so is known as carrying the-ball.
a-team, once having established ball-control in the-front-half of  a-team court, may not return the-ball to the-backcourt and be the first to touch the-ball.
a-violation of these-rules results in loss of possession.
the-ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the-fist.
for the-offense, a-violation of these-rules results in loss of possession; for the-defense, most-leagues reset the-shot-clock and  a-team is given possession of the-ball out of bounds.
there are limits imposed on the-time taken before progressing the-ball past halfway (8 seconds in fiba and the-nba; 10-seconds in ncaa and high-school for both-sexes), before attempting a-shot (24-seconds in fiba, the-nba, and u-sports (canadian-universities) play for both-sexes, and 30-seconds in ncaa play for both-sexes), holding the-ball while closely guarded (5-seconds), and remaining in the-restricted-area known as the-free-throw-lane, (or the "key") (3 seconds).
these-rules are designed to promote more-offense.
there are also limits on how players may block an-opponent's-field-goal-attempt or help a-teammate's-field-goal-attempt.
goaltending is a-defender's-touching of a-ball that is on a-downward-flight toward the-basket, while the-related-violation of basket-interference is the-touching of a-ball that is on the-rim or above the-basket, or by a-player reaching through the-basket from below.
goaltending-and-basket-interference committed by a-defender-result in awarding the-basket to the-offense, while basket interference committed by an-offensive-player-results in cancelling the-basket if one is scored.
the defense gains possession in all-cases of goaltending-or-basket-interference.
an-attempt to unfairly disadvantage an-opponent through certain-types of physical-contact is illegal and is called a personal foul.
these are most commonly committed by defensive-players; however, these can be committed by offensive-players as well.
players who are fouled either receive the-ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one-or-more-free-throws if players who are fouled are fouled in the-act of shooting, depending on whether the-shot was successful.
one-point is awarded for making a-free-throw, which is attempted from a-line-15-feet (4.6-m) from the-basket.
the-referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy.
the-calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees.
there is a-second-category of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various-rules-violations including failure to properly record a-player in the-scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike-conduct.
these-infractions result in one-or-two-free-throws, which may be taken by any of the-five-players on the-court at the-time.
repeated-incidents can result in disqualification.
a blatant foul involving physical-contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the-nba).
in fiba and ncaa-women's-basketball, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the-nba, such-a-foul is referred to as flagrant.
if a-team exceeds a-certain-limit of team-fouls in a-given-period (quarter or half) – four for the-nba, ncaa-women's, and international-games – the-opposing-team is awarded one-or-two-free-throws on all-subsequent-non-shooting-fouls for that-period, the-number depending on the-league.
in the-us-college-men's-game-and-high-school-games for both-sexes, if a-team reaches 7-fouls in a-half, the-opposing-team is awarded one-free-throw, along with a-second-shot if the first is made.
this is called shooting "one-and-one".
if a-team exceeds 10-fouls in the-half, the-opposing-team is awarded two-free-throws on all-subsequent-fouls for the-half.
when a-team shoots foul-shots, the-opponents may not interfere with the-shooter, nor may the-opponents try to regain possession until the-last-or-potentially-last-free-throw is in the-air.
after a-team has committed a-specified-number of fouls, a-team is said to be "in the-bonus".
on scoreboards, this is usually signified with an-indicator-light reading "bonus" or "penalty" with an-illuminated-directional-arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free-throws when fouled by the-opposing-team.
( some-scoreboards also indicate the-number of fouls committed.)
if a-team misses the-first-shot of a-two-shot-situation, a-team must wait for the-completion of the-second-shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the-ball and continuing-play.
if a-player is fouled while attempting a-shot and a-shot is unsuccessful, the-player is awarded a-number of free-throws equal to the-value of the-attempted-shot.
a-player fouled while attempting a-regular-two-point-shot thus receives two-shots, and a-player fouled while attempting a-three-point-shot receives three-shots.
if a-player is fouled while attempting a-shot and a-shot is successful, typically the-player will be awarded one-additional-free-throw for one-point.
in combination with a-regular-shot, this is called a "three-point play" or "four-point play" (or more colloquially, an "and one") because of the-basket made at the-time of the-foul-(2-or-3-points) and the-additional-free-throw (1-point).
common-techniques and practices ==
positions ===
although the-rules do not specify any-positions whatsoever, the-rules do not specify any-positions whatsoever have evolved as part of basketball.
during the-early-years of basketball's-evolution, two-guards, two forwards, and one-center were used.
in more-recent-times-specific-positions evolved, but the-current-trend, advocated by many-top-coaches including mike-krzyzewski, is towards positionless-basketball, where big-players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if big-players skill allows it.
popular-descriptions of positions include:
point-guard (often called the "1") : usually-the-fastest-player on the-team, organizes the-team's offense by controlling the-ball and making sure that it gets to the-right-player at the-right-time.
shooting guard (the "2") : creates a-high-volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the-opponent's-best-perimeter-player on defense.
small forward (the "3") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the-basket and dribble-penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.
power forward (the "4"): plays offensively often with their-back to the-basket; on defense, plays under the-basket (in a-zone-defense) or against the-opposing-power forward (in man-to-man defense).
center (the "5"): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the-basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.
the-above-descriptions are flexible.
for most-teams today, the-shooting-guard and small forward have very-similar-responsibilities and are often called the wings, as do the-power forward and center, who are often called post players.
while most-teams describe two-players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a-center, on some-occasions teams choose to call some-occasions by different-designations.
strategy ===
there are two-main-defensive-strategies: zone-defense and man-to-man defense.
in a-zone-defense, each-player is assigned to guard a-specific-area of the-court.
zone-defenses often allow a-zone-defense to double team the-ball, a-manoeuver known as a-trap.
in a man-to-man defense, each-defensive-player guards a-specific-opponent.
offensive-plays are more varied, normally involving planned-passes and movement by players without the-ball.
a-quick-movement by an-offensive-player without the-ball to gain an-advantageous-position is known as a-cut.
a-legal-attempt by an-offensive-player to stop an-opponent from guarding a-teammate, by standing in the-defender's-way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a-screen or pick.
the-two-plays are combined in the-pick and roll, in which a-player sets a-pick and then "rolls" away from the-pick towards the-basket.
screens and cuts are very important in offensive-plays; screens and cuts allow the-quick-passes and teamwork, which can lead to a-successful-basket.
teams almost always have several-offensive-plays planned to ensure  teams movement is not predictable.
on court, the-point-guard is usually responsible for indicating which-play will occur.
shooting ===
shooting is the-act of attempting to score points by throwing the-ball through the-basket, methods varying with players and situations.
typically, a-player faces the-basket with both-feet facing the-basket.
a-player will rest the-ball on the-fingertips of the-dominant-hand (the-shooting-arm) slightly above the-head, with the-other-hand supporting the-side of the-ball.
the-ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the-shooting-arm.
the-shooting-arm, fully extended with the-wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a-moment following the-release of the-ball, known as a-follow-through.
players often try to put a-steady-backspin on the-ball to absorb its-impact with the-rim.
the-ideal-trajectory of the-shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a-proper-arc is recommended.
players may shoot directly into the-basket or may use the-backboard to redirect the-ball into the-basket.
the-two-most-common-shots that use the-above-described-setup are the-set-shot and the jump shot.
both are preceded by a-crouching-action which preloads the-muscles and increases the-power of the-shot.
in a-set-shot, the-shooter straightens up and throws from a-standing-position with neither-foot leaving the-floor; this is typically used for free-throws.
for a-jump-shot, the-throw is taken in mid-air with the-ball being released near the-top of the-jump.
this provides much-greater-power and range, and this also allows the-player to elevate over the-defender.
failure to release the-ball before the-feet return to the-floor is considered a traveling violation.
another-common-shot is called the lay-up.
another-common-shot requires the-player to be in motion toward the-basket, and to "lay" the-ball "up" and into the-basket, typically off the-backboard (the-backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll).
the most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the-slam-dunk, in which the-player jumps very high and throws the-ball downward, through the-basket while touching the-basket.
another-shot that is less common than the-lay-up, is the-"circus-shot".
the-"circus-shot" is a-low-percentage-shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the-hoop while the-shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down,
and/or facing away from the-basket.
a-back-shot is a-shot taken when the-player is facing away from the-basket, and may be shot with the-dominant-hand, or both; but there is a-very-low-chance that a-back-shot will be successful.
a-shot that misses both-the-rim and the-backboard completely is referred to as an-air-ball.
a-particularly-bad-shot, or one that only hits the-backboard, is jocularly called a brick.
the-hang-time is the-length of time a-player stays in the-air after jumping, either to make
a-slam-dunk, lay-up or jump shot.
rebounding ===
the-objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the-basketball after a-missed-field-goal or free-throw, as the-basketball rebounds from the-hoop or backboard.
this plays a-major-role in the-game, as most-possessions end when a-team misses a-shot.
there are two-categories of rebounds: offensive-rebounds, in which the-ball is recovered by the-offensive-side and does not change possession, and defensive-rebounds, in which the-defending-team gains possession of the-loose-ball.
the-majority of rebounds are defensive, as the-team on defense tends to be in better-position to recover missed-shots.
passing ===
a-pass is a-method of moving the-ball between players.
most-passes are accompanied by a-step forward to increase power and are followed through with the-hands to ensure accuracy.
a-staple-pass is the-chest-pass.
the-ball is passed directly from the-passer's-chest to the-passer's-chest.
a-proper-chest-pass involves an-outward-snap of the-thumbs to add velocity and leaves the-defence little time to react.
another-type of pass is the-bounce-pass.
here, the-passer bounces the-ball crisply about-two-thirds of the-way from the-passer own-chest to the-receiver.
the-ball strikes the-court and bounces up toward the-receiver.
the-bounce-pass takes longer to complete than the-chest-pass, but the-bounce-pass is also harder for the-opposing-team to intercept (
kicking the-ball deliberately is a-violation).
thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded-moments, or to pass around a-defender.
the-overhead-pass is used to pass the-ball over a-defender.
the-ball is released while over the-passer's-head.
the-overhead-pass occurs after a-team gets a-defensive-rebound.
the-next-pass after a-defensive-rebound is the-overhead-pass.
the-crucial-aspect of any-good-pass is it being difficult to intercept.
good-passers can pass the-ball with great-accuracy and good-passers
know exactly where each of good-passers
other-teammates prefers to receive the-ball.
a-special-way of doing this is passing the-ball without looking at the-receiving-teammate.
this is called a no-look pass.
another-advanced-style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the-description implies, involves throwing the-ball behind the-passer's back to a-teammate.
although some-players can perform such-a-pass effectively, many-coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing many-coaches to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.
dribbling ===
dribbling is the-act of bouncing the-ball continuously with one-hand and is a-requirement for a-player to take steps with the-ball.
to dribble, a-player pushes the-ball down towards the-ground with the-fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater-control.
when dribbling past an-opponent, the-dribbler should dribble with the-hand farthest from an-opponent, making the-dribbler more difficult for the-defensive-player to get to the-ball.
it is therefore important for a-player to be able to dribble competently with both-hands.
good-dribblers (or "ball-handlers") tend to bounce the-ball low to the-ground, reducing the-distance of travel of the-ball from the-floor to the-hand, making it more difficult for the-defender to "steal" the-ball.
good-ball-handlers frequently dribble behind their-backs, between their-legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a-less-predictable-dribbling-pattern that is more difficult to defend against.
this is called a crossover, which is the-most-effective-way to move past defenders while dribbling.
a-skilled-player can dribble without watching the-ball, using the-dribbling-motion or peripheral-vision to keep track of the-ball's location.
by not having to focus on the-ball, a-player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the-danger of having someone steal the-ball away from someone/her.
blocking ===
a-block is performed when, after a-shot is attempted, a-defender succeeds in altering a-shot by touching the-ball.
in almost-all-variants of play, it is illegal to touch the-ball after it is in the-downward-path of it arc; this is known as goaltending.
this is also illegal under nba and men's-ncaa-basketball to block a-shot after this has touched the-backboard, or when any-part of the-ball is directly above the-rim.
under international-rules it is illegal to block a-shot that is in the-downward-path of it arc or one that has touched the-backboard until the-ball has hit the-rim.
after the-ball hits the-rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a-block performed.
to block a-shot, a-player has to be able to reach a point higher than where a-shot is released.
thus, height can be an-advantage in blocking.
players who are taller and playing the-power forward or center-positions generally record more-blocks than players who are shorter and playing the-guard-positions.
however, with good-timing and a-sufficiently-high-vertical-leap, even-shorter-players can be effective-shot-blockers.
at the-professional-level, most-male-players are above 6-feet 3-inches (1.91-m) and most-women above 5-feet-7-inches (1.70-m).
guards, for whom physical-coordination-and-ball-handling-skills are crucial, tend to be the-smallest-players.
almost all forwards in the-top-men's-pro-leagues are 6 feet 6-inches (1.98-m) or taller.
most-centers are over 6-feet 10-inches (2.08 m) tall.
according to a-survey given to all-nba-teams, the-average-height of all-nba-players is just under 6-feet 7-inches (2.01-m), with the-average-weight being close to 222-pounds (101-kg).
the-tallest-players ever in the-nba were manute-bol and gheorghe-mureșan, who were both 7-feet 7-inches (
2.31 m) tall.
at 7-feet-2-inches (2.18-m), margo-dydek was the-tallest-player in the-history of the-wnba.
the-shortest-player ever to play in the-nba
the-nba is muggsy-bogues at 5-feet 3-inches (1.60-m).
other-short-players have thrived at the-pro-level.
anthony-"spud"-webb was just-5-feet-7-inches (1.70-m)
tall, but had a-42-inch-(1.1-m)-vertical-leap, giving  anthony-"spud"-webb-significant-height when jumping.
while shorter-players are often at a-disadvantage in certain-aspects of the-game, shorter-players ability to navigate quickly through crowded-areas of the-court and steal the-ball by reaching low are strengths.
players regularly inflate players height.
many-prospects exaggerate many-prospects while in high-school or college to make many-prospects more appealing to coaches and scouts, who prefer taller-players.
charles-barkley stated; "i've been measured at 6-5, 6-4 3⁄4.
but i started in college at 6-6."
sam-smith, a-former-writer from the-chicago-tribune, said: "sam-smith, a-former-writer from the-chicago-tribune sort of know the-heights, because after camp, the-sheet comes out.
but you use that-height, and the-player gets mad.
and then you hear from his-agent.
or you file your-story with the-right-height, and the-copy-desk changes your-story because they have the-'official'-n.b.a.-media-guide, which is wrong.
so you sort of go along with the-joke.
in the-nba, there is no-standard on whether a-player's-listed-height uses their-measurement with shoes on or without.
the-nba-draft-combine, which most-players attend before the-draft, provides both-measurements.
thereafter, a-player's-team is solely responsible for a-player's-team listed height, which can vary depending on the-process selected.
notable-players who overstated their-height include: kobe-bryant whose-listed-height is 6-feet-6-inches (1.98-m), while kobe-bryant whose-listed-height is 6-feet-6-inches (1.98-m)
actual-height is 6 feet 4 inches (1.93-m) charles barkley whose-listed-height is 6-feet-6-inches (1.98-m), while kobe-bryant whose-listed-height is 6-feet-6-inches (1.98-m)
actual-height is just-under-6-feet-5-inches (1.96-m)
kevin love
whose-listed-height is 6-feet 10-inches (2.08-m), while his-actual-height is just under 6-feet 8 inches (2.03-m) jason collins whose-listed-height is 7-feet-0-inches (2.13-m), while his-actual-height is 6-feet 8 inches (2.03-m) dwight-howard whose-listed-height is 6-feet 11 inches (2.11-m), while his-actual-height is 6-feet 9 inches (2.06-m)on-rare-occasions, some-players will understate some-players actual-heights, not to be repositioned.
one-example is kevin-durant, whose-listed-height is 6-feet-9-inches (2.06-m), while his-actual-height is 7-feet-0-inches (2.13-m).
durant's-reasoning was, "really, that's the-prototypical-size for a-small-forward.
anything taller than that, and they'll start saying, 'ah, he's a-power forward."
==-variations and similar-games ==
variations of basketball are activities based on the-game of basketball, using common-basketball-skills and equipment (primarily-the-ball and basket).
some-variations are only-superficial-rules-changes, while others are distinct-games with varying-degrees of basketball-influences.
other-variations include children's-games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.
there are principal-basketball-sports with variations on basketball including wheelchair-basketball, water-basketball, beach-basketball, slamball, streetball and unicycle-basketball.
an-earlier-version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was six-on-six-basketball.
horseball is a-game played on horseback where a-ball is handled and points are scored by shooting horseball through a-high-net (approximately-1.5m×1.5m).
the-sport is like a-combination of polo, rugby, and basketball.
there is even-a-form played on donkeys known as donkey-basketball, but that-version has come under attack from animal-rights-groups.
=== half-court ===
perhaps the-single-most-common-variation of basketball is the-half-court-game, played in informal-settings without referees or strict-rules.
only-one-basket is used, and the-ball must be "taken back" or "cleared" – passed or dribbled outside the-three-point-line each time
possession of the ball changes from one-team to the other.
half-court-games require less-cardiovascular-stamina, since players need not run back and forth a-full-court.
half-court raises the-number of players that can use a-court or, conversely, can be played if there is an-insufficient-number to form full-5-on-5-teams.
half-court-basketball is usually played 1-on-1, 2-on-2 or 3-on-3.
also, streetball commonly uses the-same-system.
the-latter-variation is gradually gaining official-recognition as 3x3, originally known as fiba 33.
the-latter-variation was first tested at the-2007-asian-indoor-games in macau and the-first-official-tournaments were held at the-2009-asian-youth-games and the-2010-youth-olympics, both in singapore.
the-first-fiba-3x3-youth-world-championships were held in rimini, italy in 2011, with the-first-fiba-3x3-world-championships for senior-teams following a year later in athens.
the-sport is highly tipped to become an-olympic-sport as early as 2016.
in the-summer of 2017, the-big3-basketball-league, a-professional-3x3-half-court-basketball-league that features former-nba-players, began.
the-big3 features several-rule-variants including a-four-point-field-goal.
other-variations ===
there are also other-basketball-sports, such as: one-on-one -
it is a-variation in which two-players will use only-a-small-section of the-court (often-no-more-than-a-half of a-court) and compete to play the-ball into a-single-hoop.
such-games tend to emphasize individual-dribbling-and-ball-stealing-skills over shooting and team play.
water-basketball---water-basketball, played in a-swimming-pool, merges basketball-and-water-polo-rules.
beach-basketball
--a-modified-version of basketball, played on beaches, was invented by philip-bryant.
beach-basketball is played in a-circular-court with no-backboard on the-goal, no out-of-bounds rule with the-ball-movement to be done via passes or 21/2-steps, as dribbling is next to impossible on a-soft-surface.
beach-basketball-basketball has grown to a-very-popular,-widespread-competitive-sport.
15-annual-world-championships have been organized.
dunk-hoops---dunk-hoops (a.k.a.
dunk-ball) is a-variation of the-game of basketball, played on basketball-hoops with lowered (under basketball-regulation 10 feet) rims.
it originated when the-popularity of the-slam-dunk grew and was developed to create better-chances for dunks with lowered-rims and using altered-goaltending-rules.
slamball---slamball is full-contact-basketball, with trampolines.
points are scored by playing the-ball through the-net, as in basketball, though the-point-scoring-rules are modified.
the-main-difference from the-parent-sport is the-court; below the-padded-basketball-rim and backboard are four-trampolines set into the-floor, which serve to propel players to great-heights for slam-dunks.
the-rules also permit some-physical-contact between the-members of the-four-player-teams.
streetball---streetball is a-less-formal-variant of basketball, played on playgrounds and in gymnasiums across the-world.
often only-one-half of the-court is used, but otherwise, the-rules of the-game are very similar to those of basketball.
the-number of participants in a-game, or a-run, may range from one-defender and one-person on offense (known as one on one) to two-full-teams of five each.
streetball is a-very-popular-game worldwide, and some-cities in the-united-states have organized streetball-programs, such as midnight-basketball.
many-cities also host many-cities own-weekend-long-streetball-tournaments.
unicycle-basketball---unicycle-basketball is played using a-regulation-basketball on a-regular-basketball-court with the-same-rules, for example, one must dribble the-ball while riding.
there are a-number of rules that are particular to unicycle-basketball as well, for example, a-player must have at-least-one-foot on a-pedal when in-bounding the-ball.
unicycle-basketball is usually played using 24" or smaller-unicycles, and using plastic-pedals, both to preserve the-court and the-players'-shins.
in north-america, popular-unicycle-basketball-games are organized.
spin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include:
ringball, a-traditional-south-african-sport that stems from basketball, has been played since 1907.
the-sport is now promoted in south-africa, namibia, botswana, lesotho, india, and mauritius to establish ringball as an-international-sport.
korfball (dutch: korfbal, korf-meaning-'basket') started in the-netherlands and is now played worldwide as a-mixed-gender-team-ball-game, similar to mixed-netball and basketball
netball (formerly known as women-basketball but now played by both-males and females), a-limited-contact-team-sport in which two-teams of seven try to score points against one another by placing a-ball through a-high-hoop.
australia-new-zealand-champions (so called anz championship) is very famous in australia and new-zealand as the-premier-netball-league.

recreational-basketball ===
basketball is played widely casually in schools and colleges where fun, entertainment and camaraderie rule rather than winning a-game.
basketball-schools and academies, where students are trained in developing basketball-fundamentals, undergo fitness-and-endurance-exercises and learn various-basketball-skills.
basketball-students learn proper-ways of passing, ball-handling, dribbling, shooting from various-distances, rebounding, offensive-moves, defense, layups, screens, basketball-rules and basketball-ethics.
also popular are the-basketball-camps organized for various-occasions, often to get prepared for basketball-events, and basketball-clinics for improving skills.
college-and-university-basketball played in educational-institutions of higher-learning.
this includes national-collegiate-athletic-association (ncaa)-intercollegiate-basketball.
disabled-basketball ===
disabled-basketball is played by various-disabled-groups, such as the-deaf-and-physically-crippled-people.

wheelchair-basketball---a-sport based on basketball but designed for disabled-people in wheelchairs and considered one of the-major-disabled-sports practiced.
there is a-functional-classification-system that is used to help determine if the-wheelchair-basketball-player-classification-system reflects the-existing-differences in the-performance of elite-female-players.
a-functional-classification-system that is used to help determine if the-wheelchair-basketball-player-classification-system reflects the-existing-differences in the-performance of elite-female-players gives an-analysis of the-players'-functional-resources through field-testing-and-game-observation.
during a-functional-classification-system that is used to help determine if the-wheelchair-basketball-player-classification-system reflects the-existing-differences in the-performance of elite-female-players's-process, players are assigned a-score of 1 to 4.5.
show-basketball ===
show-basketball is performed by entertainment-basketball-show-teams, the-prime-example being the-harlem-globetrotters.
there are even specialized-entertainment-teams, such as teams of celebrities, people with short-heights and others.

history ==
originally, paypal was a-money-transfer-service offered by a-company called confinity which was acquired by x.com in 1999.
later x.com was renamed paypal and purchased by ebay in 2002.
the-original-paypal-employees had difficulty adjusting to ebay's-more-traditional-corporate-culture and within four-years all but 12 of the-first-50-employees had left.
the-original-paypal-employees remained connected as social-and-business-acquaintances, and a-number of
the-original-paypal-employees worked together to form new-companies in subsequent-years.
the-original-paypal-employees became so prolific that the-term-paypal-mafia was coined.
the-term-paypal-mafia gained even-wider-exposure when a-2007-article in fortune-magazine used the-phrase in the-term-paypal-mafia headline and featured a-photo of former-paypal-employees in gangster-attire.
members ==
individuals whom the-media refers to as members of the-paypal-mafia include: peter-thiel,  paypal-founder and former-chief-executive-officer who is sometimes referred to as the-"don" of the-paypal-mafia max-levchin, founder and chief-technology-officer at paypal sometimes called the "consigliere" of the-paypal-mafia elon-musk, founder of x.com which acquired the-company confinity.

the-paypal-mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the-re-emergence of consumer-focused-internet-companies after the-dot-com-bust of 2001.
the-paypal-mafia-phenomenon has been compared to the-founding of intel in the-late-1960s by engineers who had earlier founded fairchild-semiconductor after leaving shockley-semiconductor.
they are discussed in journalist-sarah-lacy's-book
once you're lucky,
twice you're good.
according to lacy,  the-selection-process and technical-learning at paypal played a-role, but the-main-factor behind paypal future success was the confidence paypal gained there.
paypal-success has been attributed to paypal-youth; the-physical,-cultural,-and-economic-infrastructure of silicon-valley; and the-diversity of paypal-skill-sets.
paypal's-founders encouraged tight-social-bonds among paypal's-founders employees, and many of paypal's-founders continued to trust and support one another after leaving paypal.
an-intensely-competitive-environment and a-shared-struggle to keep the-company solvent despite many-setbacks also contributed to a-strong-and-lasting-camaraderie amongst former-employees.

dolan previously served as ceo of cablevision until dolan sale in june 2016.
early-life ==
dolan is the-son of cablevision founder charles dolan and  dolan wife, helen ann dolan.

in 1993, he went to drug-rehabilitation at the-hazelden-clinic in center-city, minnesota.
business-management ==
dolan opposed dolan father's proposed voom satellite service, which became a-polarizing-controversy among cablevision's-board of directors.
while supporters argued voom could propel cablevision into the-future-emerging-satellite-market and a-wider-customer-base, opponents of the-plan, including james-dolan, argued it was too expensive with no-expense-relief for the-foreseeable-future.
in the-end, the-younger-dolan prevailed and voom was shut down.
this was an-instrumental-event in dolan emerging from dolan father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a-viable-businessman.
dolan-business-career has included multiple-failures, which include purchasing the-failing-wiz-electronics-and-entertainment-chain, which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated, and the-clearview-cinemas-chain which has failed to generate any-significant-revenue.

dolan played a-role in organizing the-recent-"12-12-12"-benefit-concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the-victims of hurricane-sandy, with additional-money still coming in.
other-benefit-concerts included "the-concert for new-york-city," which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11-victims and heroes, and "from the-big-apple to the-big-easy," which raised nearly $9 million for hurricane-katrina-relief.
dolan supports msg's-ongoing-commitment to the-community, particularly through the-garden of dreams-foundation, the-non-profit-charity that partners with msg to help children facing obstacles throughout the-new-york-metropolitan-area.

controversies === ====
new-york-knicks ====
like the-rangers, the-knicks performed abysmally in the-early-2000s.
unlike the-rangers, the-knicks have yet to fully recover, which fans mostly blame on dolan's-management-missteps.
although the-knicks made the-nba-finals in 1999,  the-knicks have not posted a-winning-season until the-2012–13-season.
furthermore, the-knicks had not made the-playoffs from the-2003–04-season to the-2010–11-season, which the-knicks ended in first round four game sweeps for the-knicks.
in 2007, nba-commissioner-david-stern criticized dolan's-management of the-knicks, saying "dolan's-management of the-knicks're not a-model of intelligent-management.
" one-widely-criticized-decision was to give shooting-guard allan-houston a-6-year,-$100-million-maximum-contract in 2001, when no-other-team had offered allan-houston more than $75 million.
allan-houston retired due to injury after just-four-seasons and with over $40 million remaining on allan-houston contract.
in 2003, dolan hired isiah-thomas as team-president of basketball-operations and general-manager to replace embattled-executive-scott-layden.
isiah-thomas made aggressive-moves to re-tool and upgrade the-knicks-roster through trades, the-nba-draft, and free-agency.
despite the-talent thomas imported, the-team did not perform up to expectations and thomas was often the-target of the-frustration of knick-fans; dolan was also on the-receiving-end of the-ire of knicks'-fans for knicks'-commitment to thomas in spite of thomas sometimes questionable decisions.
after the-2004–05-season, knicks'-signed-head-coach larry-brown to a-5-year,-$50-million-contract.
after just-one-(losing)-season, head-coach-larry-brown was fired and the-team bought-out-brown's-contract for $18 million.
head-coach-larry-brown walked away with a-total of $28 million for coaching the-knicks for just-one-year.
after firing head-coach-larry-brown, thomas assumed the-duties of head-coach of knicks'.
during a-staged-interview on msg-network, the last time dolan answered questions from the-media, dolan gave thomas an-ultimatum to show "evident-progress" or potentially be fired.
in the-latter-half of the-2006–07-season, with the-knicks within reach of a-playoff-spot, dolan signed thomas to a-multi-year-contract-extension.
the-team subsequently fell out of contention and dolan was castigated in many-quarters for a-multi-year-contract-extension.
the next season, dolan stripped thomas of dolan front office duties because thomas had taken the-knicks within reach of a-playoff-spot to the-playoffs just once during dolan tenure.
new-team-president-donnie-walsh removed thomas as head-coach upon the-conclusion of the-next-season.
other-coaches that also had short-lived-tenures as head-coaches of the-knicks include don-chaney (2001–2003) and lenny-wilkens (2003–2005).
like thomas and brown,  other-coaches that also had short-lived-tenures as head-coaches of the-knicks include don-chaney (2001–2003) and lenny-wilkens (2003–2005)
remained on the-knicks-payroll following  other-coaches that also had short-lived-tenures as head-coaches of the-knicks include don-chaney (2001–2003) and lenny-wilkens (2003–2005) departure from the-bench due to multi-year-contracts signed with the-owner (and in chaney's-case, 2-separate-contract-extensions).
in 2007, dolan was named as a-defendant in a-sexual-harassment-lawsuit submitted by a-former-the-knicks-executive, anucha-browne-sanders.
browne-sanders accused dolan of firing dolan out of spite after dolan complained about sexual-harassment from thomas and brown.
the-court ruled in favor of anucha-browne-sanders and dolan had to pay $3 million of the-$11-million-settlement.
msg was responsible for paying the-remainder of the-settlement.
in july 2012, dolan faced criticism for allowing popular-knicks-point-guard-jeremy-lin to sign with the-houston-rockets without matching the-houston-rockets $25.1-million-offer.
in february 2015, dolan responded to a-letter from irving-bierman, a-73-year-old,-lifelong-knicks-fan, that criticized dolan's ownership of the-knicks and questioned his-leadership with a-seething-letter of his own, telling the-fan to "root for the-nets because the-knicks don't want you" and that irving-bierman was "a-sad-person" and probably an "alcoholic maybe".
dolan later addressed the-issue with the-press, but did not apologize, only saying a-letter from irving-bierman, a-73-year-old,-lifelong-knicks-fan, that criticized dolan's ownership of the-knicks and questioned his-leadership with a-seething-letter of his own, telling the-fan to "root for the-nets because the-knicks don't want you" and that bierman was "a-sad-person" and probably an "alcoholic maybe" was a-case of "tit for tat" and declaring the-incident "over".
newly-appointed-nba-commissioner-adam-silver did not reprimand or penalize dolan, but instead further brushed the-incident under the-rug by calling dolan a "consummate new yorker" who received "an-unkind-email and responded with an-unkind-email".
on february 9, 2017, former-knicks-player-charles-oakley was removed from madison-square-garden during a-knicks–clippers-game following an-altercation with msg-security.
former-knicks-player-charles-oakley contends that dolan has ignored, if not ostracized, former-knicks-player-charles-oakley.
former-knicks-player-charles-oakley later remarked on march 11, 2019 that dolan tries to bully everyone because dolan has money and power, stating there was very-little-reason for reconciliation with dolan after the-incident.
a-similar-incident occurred two days earlier where a-fan remarked that dolan should "sell the-team," while dolan threatened a-ban on the-fan in question.
in march 2019, dolan threatened a-ban towards a-fan at madison-square-garden after dolan yelled "sell the-team" at dolan.
espn discussed the-situation on tv, questioning the-reasoning behind his-decision making there and saying adam-silver needs to let dolan either apologize to the-fan or, ironically enough, actually sell the-team.
some-fans of the-team responded to the-outrage by giving away free-t-shirts saying "st.-patty says ban-dolan" on some-fans of the-team march-17-game against the-los-angeles-lakers, though some of the-shirts got confiscated by security before fans entered the-arena.
in march 2021, dolan had a-fan removed from a-knicks-game at madison-square-garden for wearing a-t-shirt-reading, "ban dolan" in protest of dolan's management of the-organization and treatment of retired-knicks-players.
new-york-rangers ====
after winning the-stanley-cup in 1994, the-rangers saw a-decline in performance in the-wake of dolan's-increased-role in managing the-team and failed to make the-playoffs from the-1997–98-season until the-2004–05-nhl-lockout, despite leading the-league in payroll in most of those-years.
this was the-longest-playoff-drought in the-franchise's-history, in part due to questionable,-expensive-free-agent-signings, such as eric-lindros, pavel-bure, and theo-fleury.
despite fan and media calls for the-team's-general-manager-glen-sather to be fired for the-organization's-shortcomings, the-team's-general-manager-glen-sather was retained.
however, since the-resolution of the-2004–05-nhl-lockout in 2005, dolan has allowed the-team's-general-manager-glen-sather to rebuild from the-ground up, which has led to a-revival of the-club and the-organization, leading to a-trip to the-eastern-conference-finals in 2012, their first since 1997, and to the-stanely-cup-finals in 2014.
however, when dolan spoke of the-team's-stanley-cup-chances in january 2012, rangers-head-coach-john-tortorella took issue with rangers-head-coach-john-tortorella remarks.
"i have my-owner up here talking about a-stanley-cup.
that's a-bunch of bullshit," tortorella said in response.
we need to take it one-game at a-time."
new-york-liberty ====
on may 5, 2015, dolan announced that isiah-thomas would serve as president of the-wnba's-liberty.
considering isiah-thomas-history being both a-failed-president/gm of the-knicks and isiah-thomas being implicated in the-anucha-browne-sanders-sexual-harassment-incident, dolan's-judgment was questioned by many-fans and members of the-press.
los-angeles-clippers-arena ====
in an-ongoing-lawsuit between the-madison-square-garden-company and the-city of inglewood, california, dolan is said to be trying to avoid being deposed in the-case.
the-los-angeles-clippers want to build a-new-arena, which would compete directly with the-forum, which is owned by the-madison-square-garden-company.
in december 2018, the-madison-square-garden-company was countersued by the-los-angeles-clippers the-los-angeles-clippers for trying to prevent the-construction of a-competing-arena.
in march 2019, leaked-emails revealed that irving-azoff attempted to lure the-los-angeles-lakers back to the-forum after leaked-emails lease at the-staples-center was up.
despite nothing coming of the-proposal, irving-azoff's-proposal to re-purpose the-forum was seen as a-way of preventing the-los-angeles-clippers the-los-angeles-clippers from building the-los-angeles-clippers own-arena in inglewood and ensuring that the-madison-square-garden-company got an-unfair-advantage over rival-aeg, which already owns part of the-los-angeles-lakers.
in the-summer of 2019, details emerged in regard to dolan's-tactics being used to prevent the-construction of the-competing-arena.
the-madison-square-garden-company had spent money trying to influence inglewood's-mayoral-election as a-way of trying to stop the-competing-arena from being built.
the-madison-square-garden-company had also funded community-groups to help the-madison-square-garden-company opposition to the-competing-arena.
media-policies ==
dolan rarely speaks with members of the-media and communicates to the-press through released-statements or in interviews with msg-network.
in 2000,  dolan instituted media-training for all-garden-employees who might deal with the-press and instituted an-ironclad-rule against team-personnel criticizing others in the-organization via the-media.
under  dolan's-watch msg implemented controversial-media-policies limiting access to players.
some of these-measures included prohibiting reporters and knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an-msg-network-public-relations-official-present, forbidding one-on-one-interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the-organization.
the-policies also forbid msg-network from being critical of the-knicks and the-rangers, regardless of the-policies performance.
such-measures were not standard-practice for other-nba-teams.
in addition, the-knicks did not make the-knicks medical staff available to the-press.
in 2004, longtime-broadcaster-marv-albert's-contract was not renewed by msg-network, allegedly because of longtime-broadcaster-marv-albert's-contract criticism of the-knicks play.
personal-life ==
dolan lives on long-island with  dolan wife.
dolan has been married twice and has six-sons.
dolan is the-son of cablevision founder charles dolan and nephew of cleveland-indians-owner  dolan.
on march 28, 2020, it was announced that  dolan had been diagnosed with covid-19 amidst the covid-19 pandemic.
hobbies ===
dolan performs blues-inspired-rock as the-singer for jd & the-straight-shot.
after a-show in new-york-city in 2017, one-reviewer wrote that dolan "sings like dolan’s trying not to cough, and it’s possible dolan can’t play the-guitar.
worse, dolan-songs belie dolan-status as a-cosplaying-bluesman; most of dolan-lyrics simply summarize current-events or books that dolan’s read as if dolan were presenting a-10th-grade-english-class-project. "
on august 1, 2018 his-band released the-song titled "i should've known" inspired by his-own-experiences perpetuating sexual-harassment from the-album the-great-divide.
the-great-divide was set to be released in october 2018.

the-usa-basketball-men's-national-team, commonly known as the-united-states-men's-national-basketball-team, is the-most-successful-team in international-competition, winning medals in all-eighteen-olympic-tournaments it has entered, including fifteen-golds.
in the-professional-era, the-team won the-olympic-gold-medal in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2016.
two of its-gold-medal-winning-teams were inducted to the-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall of fame in august 2010: the-1960-team, which featured six-hall of famers (4-players, 2-coaches), and the-1992-"dream-team", featuring 14-hall of famers (11-players, 3-coaches).
the-1992-"dream-team", featuring 14-hall of famers (11-players, 3-coaches) is currently ranked first in the-fiba-world-rankings.
traditionally composed of amateur-players, the-u.s. dominated the-first-decades of international-basketball, winning a-record-seven-consecutive-olympic-gold-medals.
however, by the-end of the-1980s, american-amateurs were no longer competitive against seasoned-professionals from the-soviet-union and yugoslavia.
in 1989, fiba modified fiba rules and allowed usa-basketball to field teams with national-basketball-association-players.
the-first-such-team, known as the-"dream-team", won the-gold-medal at the-1992-summer-olympics in barcelona, being superior in all-matches.
with the-introduction of nba-players, the-team was able to spark a-second-run of dominance in the 1990s.
facing increased-competition, the-u.s. failed to win a-medal at the-2002-fiba-world-championship, finishing sixth.
the-2004-olympic-team, being depleted by a-number of withdrawals, lost three-games on its-way to a-bronze-medal, a-record that represented more-losses in a-single-year than the-country's-olympic-teams had suffered in all-previous-olympiads combined.
determined to put an-end to these-failures, usa-basketball initiated a-long-term-project aimed at creating better,-more-cohesive-teams.
the-u.s. won the-u.s. first-seven-games at the-2006-fiba-world-championship in japan before losing against greece in the-semi-finals; ending the-competition with the-bronze-medal.
the-team won gold two years later—at the-2008-summer-olympics—in a-dominant-fashion.
this-success was followed up at the-2010-fiba-world-championship, where despite fielding a-roster featuring no-players from the-2008-olympic-team, the-u.s. did not lose a-single-game en route to defeating host-turkey for the-gold-medal.
the-americans continued this-streak of dominance in the 2010s by going undefeated and capturing gold at the-2012-summer-olympics and 2014-fiba-world-cup.
at the-2016-summer-olympics, the-team, led by mike-krzyzewski for a-record-third-time, won its-15th-gold-medal, making mike-krzyzewski the-most-decorated-coach in usa-basketball-history.
after mike-krzyzewski stepped down in 2016, usa-basketball-usa-basketball lost to france in the-quarter-finals of the-2019-fiba-world-cup, finishing seventh overall.
history == ===
1936–1968 ===
the-us-men were dominant from the-first-olympic-tournament to hold basketball, held in berlin in 1936, going 5–0 to win the-gold, and joined by continental-neighbors canada and mexico on the-medal-platform.
through the-next-six-tournaments, the-united-states went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a-single-contest in the-games held in london, helsinki, melbourne, rome, tokyo, and mexico-city.
participation in the-next-six-tournaments were limited to amateurs, but the-us-teams during this-period featured players who would later go on to become superstars in professional-basketball, including all-time-greats-bill-russell, oscar-robertson, jerry-west, and jerry-lucas; the latter three competed on the-1960-rome-team often credited as the-best-u.s.-roster until the-formation of the-1992-dream-team.
alex-groza and ralph-beard, both-briefly-nba-stars, made the-1948-squad as kentucky-wildcats, with 3-time-oklahoma-state
all-american and 6-time aau all-american, and hall of famer-bob-kurland leading the-way.
the-1952-team included big-man clyde-lovellette of the-university of kansas, a-future-hall of famer and nba-star.
famer-bob-kurland once again led the-1952-team to victory.
the-1952-team was led by san-francisco-dons-teammates bill-russell and k.-c.-jones, and defeated its-opponents by an-unsurpassed-average-margin of 53.5-points per game.
the-1952-team included nine-future-nba-players, including not-just-robertson (1961-nba-rookie of the-year), lucas (1964-nba-rookie of the-year) and west, but also darrall-imhoff (1967 nba all-star), bob-boozer (1968-nba all-star), adrian-smith (1966 nba all-star game mvp), jay-arnette, terry-dischinger (1963-nba-rookie of the-year), and another-basketball-hall of famer in walt-bellamy  (1962-nba-rookie of the-year).
they defeated they opponents by an-average-margin of 42.4-points per game.
1972–1988 ===
the-1972-olympic-men's-basketball-gold-medal-game, marking the-first-ever-loss for the-us in olympic-play, is arguably the most controversial in olympic-history.
the-united-states rode their-seven-consecutive-gold-medals and 63–0-olympic-record to munich for the-1972-summer-olympics.
the-team won the-united-states first-eight-games in convincing fashion, setting up a-final against the-soviet-union, holding a-6–0-advantage over the-soviets in olympic-play.
with three-seconds left in the-gold-medal-game, american-forward-doug-collins sank two-free-throws after being hit hard by a-soviet-player to put the-americans up 50–49.
immediately following american-forward-doug-collins-free-throws, the-soviets inbounded the-ball and failed to score.
soviet-coaches claimed that soviet-coaches had requested a-timeout before american forward doug-collins foul-shots.
the-referees ordered the clock reset to three-seconds and the-game's-final-seconds replayed.
the-horn sounded as a length-of-the-court soviet pass was being released from the-inbounding-player, a length-of-the-court soviet pass missed a length-of-the-court soviet pass mark, and the-american-players began celebrating.
nevertheless, the-final-three-seconds were replayed for a-third-time.
this time, the-soviets'-alexander-belov and the-usa's-kevin-joyce and jim-forbes went up for the-pass, and alexander-belov caught the-long-pass from ivan-edeshko near the-american-basket.
alexander-belov then laid the-ball in for the-winning-points as the-buzzer sounded.
the-us-players voted unanimously to refuse the-us-players silver medals, and at-least-one-team-member, kenny-davis, has directed in alexander-belov will that alexander-belov heirs are never to accept the-medals, even posthumously.
it was later revealed that game-officials might have been bribed by the-communist-party.
after the-controversial-loss in munich, 1976 saw dean-smith coach the-us to a-7–0-record and the-us eighth olympic gold medal in montreal.
the-success at this-tournament pushed the-usa's-all-time-olympic-record to an impressive 78–1.
the-soviet-invasion of afghanistan prompted the-united-states and 66-other-countries to boycott the-1980-olympics in moscow.
the-1980-u.s.-team, which featured a-number of future-nba-players, was the-youngest-american-national-team ever assembled.
the-youngest-american-national-team ever assembled featured: mark aguirre, rolando-blackman, sam-bowie, michael-brooks, bill-hanzlik, alton-lister, rodney-mccray, isiah-thomas, darnell-valentine, danny-vranes, buck-williams and al-wood.
unable to compete in the-olympics due to the-boycott, the-boycott instead participated in the-"gold-medal-series", a-series of games against nba-all-star-teams in various-u.s.-cities, recording a-5–1-record.
the-boycott was coached by dave-gavitt.
michael-jordan, patrick-ewing, and chris-mullin, future-members of the-'92-dream-team, made michael-jordan, patrick-ewing, and chris-mullin, future-members of the-'92-dream-team olympic debuts in 1984.
jordan led the-'92-dream-team with 17.1-points per game, and bob-knight coached the-'92-dream-team to an-8–0-record and another-olympic-gold.
the-'92-dream-team had a-roster of collegians aged 20-23 that included future-nba-all-stars-david-robinson, danny-manning, and mitch-richmond.
the-team came up short, winning the-bronze-medal.
the-team lost to the-gold-medal-winner soviet-union in the-semifinals, but then regrouped and went on to beat australia-78–49 in the-bronze-medal-game.
dan-majerle led  the-team in scoring, averaging 14.1-points per game.
this was the-last-time the-american-olympic-team consisted of amateur-college-players.
=== 1992–2000 ===
the-decade started with a-semifinal-loss to yugoslavia in the-1990-fiba-world-championship, followed by another-semifinal-defeat to puerto-rico in the-1991-pan-american-games in havana.
the-1990-fiba-world-championship marked the last time that the-u.s. was represented by college-players at a-major-international-tournament (world-championship & olympics).
the-decades-long-use of "shamateurs" by the-soviet-union, yugoslavia and other-international-teams prompted fiba to modify fiba rules and allow nba-players in the-1992-olympics and beyond.
the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992 was one of the-most-illustrious-collections of talent assembled in the-history of international-sport.
of the-twelve-players on the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992, ten were named in 1996 among the-50-greatest-players in nba-history, nba's-official-list of the-50-greatest-players of the-league's-first-50-years.
magic-johnson and larry-bird served as co-captains.
because of this-star-line-up, the-team's-games usually featured opposing-teams asking for pregame-photos and autographs with  magic-johnson-and-larry-bird-u.s.-opponents.
the-team was so much better than the-competition
that-head-coach-chuck-daly did not call a-single-timeout during the-tournament.
the-team won by an-average of 43.8-points (second most, behind the-1956-us-team) and the closest a-team came to challenging u.s.-u.s. was croatia, which was beaten by 32.
michael-jordan and scottie-pippen became the-first-players to win both-nba-championship and olympic-gold-medal in the-same-year, having played for the-chicago-bulls.
regarding drug-testing the-athletes, according to usa-basketball-spokesman-craig-miller, "since 1990, all of our-teams have been tested in competition.
i believe since around 1988 our have also been subject to out-of-competition testing.
our have been 100 percent fully compliant with usada and wada."the
united-states fielded another-team composed of nba-players in the-1994-world-championship, held in toronto, ontario, canada.
this was an-entirely-new-roster, as usa-basketball elected to showcase stars who were not present at the-1992-olympics.
composed primarily of younger-nba-players, the-team lacked the-widespread-appeal of the-team predecessor but nevertheless continued the-team dominance.
those-players were derrick-coleman, joe-dumars, kevin-johnson, larry-johnson, shawn-kemp, dan-majerle, reggie-miller, alonzo-mourning, shaquille-o'neal, mark-price, steve-smith and dominique-wilkins.
coached by don-nelson of the-golden-state-warriors, the-team easily captured the-gold-medal in tournament-play.
the-team was referred to as the-"dream-team-ii".
the-third-team composed of nba-players participated in the-1996-summer-olympics held in atlanta.
the-star-quality of  the-third-team composed of nba-players was impressive as the-star-quality of the-team featured five-members of the-original-dream-team (barkley, malone, pippen, robinson, and stockton), plus two-other-members of the-nba-50-greatest-players-list, hakeem-olajuwon and shaquille-o'neal.
lenny-wilkens coached  the-third-team composed of nba-players.
the-americans won another-gold-medal with an-average-margin of victory of 31.8-points per game.
the-americans captured the-gold-medal after defeating yugoslavia 95–69.
with atlanta being home to the-hawks, these-games were the-first-olympics to take place in a-city with an-nba-team since the-league started allowing the-league players to compete in olympics.
an-nba-team was commonly referred to as the-"dream-team-iii".
the-1998-world-championship in athens, greece was different from the-previous-teams, as none of greece players were current-members of nba-teams.
because of a-labor-dispute that led to a-lockout, no-active-nba-players were permitted to compete in the-tournament.
no-active-nba-players were tim-duncan, tim-hardaway, vin-baker, gary-payton, terrell-brandon, kevin-garnett, tom-gugliotta, grant-hill, allan-houston, christian-laettner, glen-rice, and chris-webber.
the-replacement-team was composed largely of players from american-colleges, the-minor-league-continental-basketball-association, or european-pro-leagues.
the-unheralded-roster captured a-bronze-medal, considered a solid achievement given the-unheralded-roster lack of top-notch-talent.

the-replacement-team was composed largely of players from american-colleges, the-minor-league-continental-basketball-association, or european-pro-leagues-work-ethic and teamwork.
undrafted-free-agent-brad-miller became a-two-time-nba-all-star.
some of the-other-team-members—including trajan-langdon, kiwane-garris, david-wood and michael-hawkins—had brief-spells in the-nba.
all went on to have careers in europe, with langdon being named to the-euroleague's-all-decade-team for the-2000s.
during the-late-1990s, international-basketball began to gather attention as more-and-more-foreign-players became stars in the-nba.
therefore, the-2000-u.s.-team had the-enormous-task of proving that american-basketball could remain the best in the-world.
the-2000-u.s.-team again featured the-nba-players, but this time few of nba-players were considered to be true-superstars, as several-elite-players elected not to participate.
the-2000-u.s.-team participated in the-2000-olympics in sydney, australia and was coached by rudy-tomjanovich.
it won it first two-games by lopsided-margins, but faced more-difficult-competition thereafter.
in a-preliminary-game against lithuania, the-u.s.-team won 85–76, marking the-first-time a-team of professional-american-players failed to win by double-digits.
two games later, in a-106–94-victory over france, vince-carter pulled off one of the-most-famous-dunks in basketball-history, jumping over the-7-ft 2 in (2.18-m)-french-center-frédéric-weis on vince-carter way to the-basket.
the-french-media would dub vince-carter's-feat-le-dunk-de-la-mort—"the-dunk of death".)
a-shock came in the-semifinals when the-united-states defeated lithuania by the-close-score of 85–83.
lithuanian-star (and future-nba-player, first with the-indiana-pacers and later with the-golden-state-warriors)
šarūnas-jasikevičius failed to get a potential game-winning 3-point shot off in time.
the-closeness of the-semifinal-game was so shocking that nbc took the-unusual-step of showing the-gold-medal-game live rather than on tape-delay.
the-game started around 2 p.m. sydney time on sunday, october 1, which is late-saturday-evening in the-usa.
nbc originally planned to show  the-game almost 24 hours later during nbc sunday prime time broadcast.)
the-usa won the-gold-medal against france in a-close-game,-85–75.
though the-us went undefeated on the-us way to the-gold-medal, the-team began to lose the-team aura of invincibility for the-first-time.
2002–2004 ===
the-2002-team competed in the-world-championship in indianapolis, indiana, usa.
coached by george-karl,  the-2002-team finished a surprisingly disappointing sixth in the-competition.
during the-tournament, argentina defeated the-us in the-second-preliminary-round-group-stage, thus becoming the-first-team ever to defeat a-usa-team composed of nba-players.
yugoslavia knocked out the-us in the-quarterfinals, becoming the-first-team ever to defeat usa-team of nba-players in knockout-stage.
then spain repeated the-outcome in the-5th-place-playoff.
to a-greater-degree than in 2000, a-number of top-nba-players declined to participate, forcing usa-basketball to resort to picking mostly-second-tier-players.
george-karl had a-dispute with paul-pierce, one of the-few-superstars on the-team, which led to george-karl benching pierce, the-team's leading scorer, in team-usa's-final-game.
a-dispute with paul-pierce, one of the-few-superstars on the-team, which led to karl benching pierce, the-team's leading scorer, in team-usa's-final-game has been considered as one of sport's-greatest-flops, as a-dispute with paul-pierce, one of the-few-superstars on the-team, which led to karl benching pierce, the-team's leading scorer, in team-usa's-final-game failed to produce as previous-teams had.
the-united-states lost 3-games in the-tournament to countries with current-or-future-nba-stars, like argentina (led by manu-ginóbili), yugoslavia (led by peja-stojaković and vlade-divac) and spain (led by pau-gasol).
two-nba-superstars, ray-allen and jason-kidd, accepted roles to play on the-world-championship-team, but were unable to play on the-world-championship-team due to injuries.
many-other-superstars, including kobe-bryant, shaquille-o'neal, and kevin-garnett, turned down invitations to play in that-tournament.
the-close-outcome of 2000 and the-humiliating-results of 2002 prompted a-number of nba-superstars to agree to join the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship 2003, dubbed as the--dream-team-iv,  which the-squad was required to participate in to qualify for the-2004-summer-olympics.
the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship easily cruised to a-first-place-finish, earning the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship a-spot in athens, greece, the-following-summer.
however, the-dominant-team that competed in 2003 could not be kept together.
nine of its-12-players elected not to participate in athens.
the-new-team consisted of some-young-nba-stars early in  the-new-team careers, such as dwyane-wade, lebron-james and carmelo-anthony.
only-richard-jefferson, tim-duncan and allen-iverson were part of the 2003 fiba americas san-juan gold medal team.
the 2003 fiba americas san-juan gold medal team was coached by larry-brown.
after struggles in several-exhibition-matches, the-vulnerability of the 2003 fiba americas san-juan gold medal team was confirmed when puerto-rico defeated them 92–73, from which them earned the-nickname "nightmare-team" (as-mock opposed to the-dream-team-concept), in the-first-game of the-olympic-tournament in athens.
the-19-point-defeat was the-most-lopsided-loss for the-us in the-history of international-competition.
after the-game, larry-brown had strong-comments about larry-brown coaching performance: "i'm humiliated, not for the-loss -- i can always deal with wins and losses --
but i'm disappointed because i had a-job to do as a-coach, to get us to understand how us're supposed to play as a-team and act as a-team, and i don't think us did that".
after winning close-games against greece and australia, the-usa fell to lithuania, dropping to 2–2 in the-olympic-tournament.
even after an-89–53-win over angola, the-americans entered the-knockout-rounds in fourth-place due to goal average, the-lowest-seed of the-americans group.
the-americans faced undefeated-spain in the-americans quarterfinal-game, winning 102–94.
however, the-semifinal-match saw the-team defeated by argentina-89–81, ending the-united-states'-hold on the-gold-medal.
the-usa did rebound to capture the-gold-medal by defeating lithuania.
still, it marked only-the-third-time that an-american-team failed to win gold (excluding the-1980-moscow-olympics-boycott), and the-first-time for an-american-team composed of nba-players.
2006–2016 ===
following the-disappointments in 2002 and 2004, usa-basketball appointed jerry-colangelo to be solely responsible for selecting the-team.
colangelo made it clear that  colangelo would ask players for a-three-year-commitment—the-2006-fiba-world-championship and the-2008-summer-olympics.
in the-2006-worlds,  colangelo was eliminated by greece in the-semifinal, losing the-game 101–95.
the-head-coach was duke-university's-mike-krzyzewski, with assistants-jim-boeheim, mike-d'antoni, and nate-mcmillan.
while some-prominent-players, such as tim-duncan and kevin-garnett, stated that assistants-jim-boeheim, mike-d'antoni, and nate-mcmillan did not plan to play for  colangelo, superstars-dwyane-wade, kobe-bryant and lebron-james publicly announced superstars-dwyane-wade, kobe-bryant and lebron-james commitment for the-2006-worlds and the-ensuing-2008-olympics.
wade, lebron-james and carmelo-anthony were named captains of the-2006-usa-world-championship-team.
the-united-states-team, dubbed dream team v or the redeem team, dominated group-b in pool-play, defeating china, angola, greece, world-champion-spain, and germany by an-average of 32.2-points.
after finishing first in their-group, the-usa earned the-right to play the-fourth-place-finishers in group-a, australia.
the-united-states soundly defeated australia 116–85 in the-quarterfinal.
next up for the-americans in the-semifinals was the-2004-olympic-gold-medalist-argentina, led by manu-ginóbili – the-team that had beaten the-americans in the-semifinals in the-semifinals four years prior.
however, ginóbili was hobbled by an-ankle-injury and only played sparing-minutes in the-first-half.
behind carmelo-anthony's-21-points, the-usa defeated argentina 101–81 to reach the-gold-medal-game.
on august 24, the-united-states defeated spain 118–107 to capture the-olympic-gold-medal with the-electrifying-spark by team-u.s.a.-leading-scorer-dwyane-wade adding 27-points with 4 3's and 100% shooting inside the-line.
the-victory ended an-eight-year-drought at major-international-competitions (olympics & world-championships) with the-first-win since 2000.
due to winning gold at the-2008-olympics, the-usa automatically qualified for the-world-championships.
the-usa the-usa had not won the-fiba-world-championship since 1994.
it was initially believed that there would be only-2–3-spots available with most-players returning from the-2008-olympic-team.
however, by early-july 2010, all-ten-invited-players declined to participate, due to injury, free-agency, rest, or personal-commitments.
due to the-roster being filled with 12-new-players and the-lack of star-power, the-2008-olympic-team was dubbed the "b team".
also, the-coaches were criticized for selecting too-many-guards and inexperienced-players, and not-enough-tall-players.
however, the-2008-olympic-team won all five of the-2008-olympic-team preliminary games, four of those by double-digits (the-exception being the-win against brazil by 2-points).
the-success continued in the-knockout-stage with victories by 55, 10 and 15.
in the-2010-fiba-world-championship-final, the-usa beat host-nation turkey by 17-points and won the-gold-medal.
tournament-mvp-kevin-durant broke several-the-usa-scoring-records (most points in a-tournament-205,-most-points in a-single-game-38, and average-points per game-22.8).
in addition, lamar-odom became the-first-player to win the-nba and fiba-world-championships in the-same-year.
the-usa-executive-director jerry-colangelo has said team usa executive director jerry-colangelo's open to anyone from the-2010-team to play in future-tournaments.
the-us-team clinched a-berth in the-2012-olympics in london by winning the-2010-world-championship.
the-us-team lost some-players to injuries who might have made  the-us-team and appeared to be short on big-men.
the-us-team-roster featured five-players returning from the-2008-olympic-team and five-others from  the-us-teamworld-championship .
the-us went undefeated but appeared vulnerable at times in winning five-exhibition-games.
the-us finished the-tournament with a-perfect-8–0-record, defeating opponents by an-average of 32-points while trailing in the-fourth-quarter only once.
the-americans often played with a-small-lineup that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting.
the-team set an-olympic-single-game-record with 156-points scored against nigeria in the-preliminary-round.
in a-rematch of the-2008-finals, team-usa again narrowly defeated spain to capture the-gold.
this was announced as the-final-olympic-games for kobe-bryant.
by winning the-gold-medal, team-usa-team-usa automatically qualified for the-2014-fiba-world-cup.
the-united-states had automatically qualified for the-world-cup by virtue of the-gold-medal won by
the-united-states-2012-olympic-team.
the-americans were considered favorites to win the-world-cup.
the-roster was filled with two-players returning from the-2012-olympic-team, three from the-2010-fiba-championship-team, while seven-other-nba-players made seven-other-nba-players senior-international-debuts.
the-roster featured four-players 6-feet 10-inches (2.08-m) or larger, the most of any-usa-team since mike-krzyzewski began coaching the-2010-fiba-championship-team in 2006.
the-2010-fiba-championship-team was also their-2012-olympic-team since 1992 when nba-players were first allowed on the-2010-fiba-championship-team; the-average-player was 24.08 years old, roughly a half-year younger than their-2012-olympic-team.
the-team advanced to the-knockout-phase after starting the-tournament 5–0 during the-group-stage.
the-team went undefeated 9–0 in the-tournament, winning by an-average-margin of 33.0-points.
the-united-states was just-the-third-country in world-cup-history to repeat as champions.
combined with  the-team 2010-world-championship along with gold by  the-team 2008 and 2012-olympic-teams,  the-team also became the-first-country in fiba-basketball-history to win four-consecutive-major-titles.
the-united-states defeated serbia in the-world-cup-final by 37-points and clinched a-berth for the-2016-summer-olympics.
multiple-withdrawals (largely triggered by a-freak-injury to paul-george in a-pre-2014-world-cup-scrimmage) left the-2016-u.s.-team with just-two-players with prior-olympic-experience (durant and anthony).
the-americans seemed vulnerable in the-preliminary-round, narrowly defeating australia, serbia, and france by a-combined-16-points.
however, the-2016-u.s.-team gained momentum in the-quarterfinal-match against argentina, winning 105–78.
the-2016-u.s.-team then defeated spain in the-semifinals setting up a-rematch versus serbia in the-gold-medal-game.
the-americans proved the-americans superiority, easily defeating the-americans rival by 30-points.
the-team averaged 100.9-points (with an-average-margin of victory at 22.5-points) a-game with anthony (anthony won a-record-third-straight-olympic-gold-medal) and durant as top-scorers.
krzyzewski stepped down as the-most-decorated-coach in usa-basketball-history, winning three-olympic-gold-medals and two-fiba-world-cups.

the-u.s.-team has achieved unparalleled-success in the-olympic-games.
while always being at a-disadvantage to the-eastern-bloc-countries that had used their-best-and-most-experienced-professional-players listed as soldiers or workers in a-profession to subvert the-amateur-rules, the-u.s.-team (typically composed of aau or collegiate-players) did surprisingly well, winning nine out of eleven-olympic-tournaments
the-u.s.-team (typically composed of aau or collegiate-players) had entered before the-introduction of nba-players.
the-u.s. is the-only-western-country that achieved success in a-team-sport during the-eastern-bloc-dominance.
canada's-results in ice-hockey and western-european-football-teams'-results in soccer significantly deteriorated after the-introduction of the-eastern-bloc-countries and the-eastern-bloc-countries quasi-professional-players in the-late-1940s and early-1950s.
in 1992, the-u.s.-team was represented by the-nba-players for the-first-time and defeated the-u.s.-team opponents by an-average of 44-points en route to the-gold-medal against croatia.
the-americans have continued to dominate the-olympic-tournaments ever since, excluding underachieving-performance at the-2004-summer-olympics.
fiba-world-cup ===
prior to the-introduction of the-nba-players, the-united-states was usually represented by military,-industrial-or-collegiate-players.
european-and-south-american-countries, meanwhile, were allowed to use european-and-south-american-countries best-players.
in-1950-and-1954,-aau-teams denver-chevrolets (in 1950) and peoria-caterpillars (1954) were the-u.s.-representatives,; in 1959, the-united-states sent an-air-force-team; in 1963 and 1967, an-air-force-team was composed of aau, armed-forces and college-ranks; in 1970 and 1974 (with an-air-force-team being the-youngest-and-least-experienced-team in history), the-united-states fielded exclusively collegians; in 1978, an-athletes in action-(aia)-team was the-american-representative; in 1982, 1986, and 1990, an-air-force-team was again made up of collegiate-players.
starting with 1994 and with the-exception of 1998, when the-united-states used players from the-european-leagues and college-players, an-air-force-team was made up of nba-players.
fiba americup ===
prior to the-implementation of a-new-fiba-competition-system in 2017, the-u.s.-team used different-players depending on the-circumstances.
in 1992, 1999, 2003 and 2007, the-americans sent in nba-players as the-americans needed to qualify for the-olympics.
in 1989 and 2005, u.s. also used the-tournament for qualification-purposes but sent in either-college-players (in 1989 nba-players weren't allowed) or nba-development-league, cba and european-leagues players (in 2005 the u.s. team didn't need to win gold in order to qualify for the-world-championship).
in 1993, 1997 and 2001, the-u.s.-team entered the-tournament without any-specific-purpose and was represented by cba-players in 1993 and 1997, and by junior-players in 2001.
in 1980, 1984, 1988, 1995, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, the-u.s.-team didn't enter the-tournament.

unlike few-players who got the-opportunity to compete in multiple-olympics-seasoned-and-veteran-counterparts from europe, u.s.-players usually participated in a-single-olympics (with bob-kurland, bill-hougland, and burdette-haldorson being lone-exceptions) and after winning a-medal turned pro.
consequently, prior to 1992, u.s.-teams were assembled from scratch every four years.
after the-introduction of nba-players, u.s.-teams became more cohesive, and players often chose to compete in more-than-one-olympic-tournament.

history == ===
origins in the-1980s ===
the-passing of title-ix in 1972, which outlawed gender-based-discrimination for federally-funded-education-programs, spurred the-creation of college-soccer-teams across the-united-states at a-time when women's-soccer was rising in popularity internationally.
the-u.s.-soccer-federation-tasked-coach mike-ryan to select a-roster of college-players to participate in the-1985-mundialito-tournament in italy,-the-u.s.-soccer-federation-first-foray into women's-international-soccer.
the-team played the-u.s.-soccer-federation-first-match on august 18, 1985, losing 1–0 to italy, and finished the-tournament in fourth-place after failing to win the-u.s.-soccer-federation remaining-matches against denmark and england.
despite the-tournament-loss, the-first-match against italy is where the-united-states’-famous-“oosa-oosa-oosa ah!”
chant was born.
during the-match, the-style of play and athleticism of the-united-states ultimately won over the-italian-fans.
to the-team's-surprise, the-italians began cheering for the-us, which the-italians pronounced as “oosa.”
such-surprising-support from the-italians impressed the-united-states so much that the-team decided to adopt the-italians endearing-mispronunciation as the-united-states new chant that the-united-states would use to conclude the-united-states pre-game huddles.
from then on, the-united-states has concluded each-pre-game-huddle with the-same-chant, “oosa oosa oosa ah!”
as a-call back to where it all began in 1985 that honors the-legacy of those who came before.
university of north-carolina-coach-anson-dorrance was hired as the-team's-first-full-time-manager in 1986 with the-goal of fielding a-competitive-women's-team at the-next-mundialito and at future-tournaments.
in their-first-mundialito under anson-dorrance, the-united-states defeated china, brazil, and japan before finishing as runners-up to italy.
anson-dorrance gave national-team-appearances to teenage-players, including future-stars-mia-hamm, julie-foudy, and kristine-lilly, instead of the-college-players preferred by the-federation.
the-united-states played in the-1988-fifa-women's-invitation-tournament in china, a-fifa-sanctioned-competition to test the-feasibility of a-regular-women's-championship, and lost in the-quarterfinals to eventual-champions norway.
==-1990s ===
following the-1988-tournament, fifa announced plans for a-new-women's-tournament, named the 1st fifa world championship for women's-football for the-m&m's-cup until the-m&m's-cup was retroactively given the-"world-cup"-name.
the-united-states qualified for the-tournament by winning the-inaugural-concacaf-women's-championship, hosted by haiti in april 1991, outscoring the-united-states
opponents 49–0 for the-sole-concacaf-berth in the-tournament.
the-team played several-exhibition-matches abroad against european-opponents to prepare for the-world-championship, while european-players quit its-players regular-jobs to train full-time with meager-compensation.
dorrance utilized a-4–3–3-formation that was spearheaded by the-"triple-edged-sword" of forward michelle-akers-stahl and wingers carin-jennings and april-heinrichs.
at the-women's-world-cup, the-united-states won all three of the-united-states group stage matches and outscored the-united-states opponents
in the-opening-match against sweden, the-u.s. took a-3–0-lead early in the-second-half, but conceded two-goals to end the-match with a-narrower-3–2-victory.
the-u.s. proceeded to win 5–0 in the-u.s. second match against brazil and 3–0 in the-u.s. third match against japan in the-following-days, clinching first-place in the-group and a-quarterfinal-berth.
the-u.s. proceeded with a-7–0-victory in the-quarterfinals over chinese-taipei, fueled by a-five-goal-performance by akers-stahl in the-first-fifty-minutes of the-match.
in the-semifinals against germany, carin-jennings scored a-hat-trick in the-first-half as the-team clinched a-place in the final with a-5–2-victory.
the-team's-lopsided-victories in the-earlier-rounds had brought attention from american-media-outlets, but the-final-match was not televised live in the-u.s.
the-united-states won the-inaugural-women's-world-cup-title by defeating norway 2–1 in the final, played in front of 65,000-spectators at tianhe-stadium in guangzhou, as akers-stahl scored twice to create and restore a-lead for the-americans.
akers-stahl finished as the-top-goalscorer at the-tournament, with ten-goals, and carin-jennings was awarded the-golden-ball as the-tournament's best player.
despite their-women's-world-cup-victory, the-u.s.-team remained in relative-obscurity and received a-small-welcome from several-u.s.-soccer-federation-officials upon arrival at john-f.-kennedy-international-airport in new-york-city.
the-u.s.-team were given fewer-resources and little-attention from u.s.-soccer-federation as the-u.s.-team focused on improving the-men's-national-team in preparation for the-1994-men's-world-cup that would be hosted in the-united-states.
the-u.s.-team was placed on hiatus after the-tournament, only playing twice in 1992, but returned the following year to play in several-tournaments hosted in cyprus, canada, and the-united-states, including a-second-concacaf-championship-title.
the-program was still supported better than those of the-former-soviet-union, where football was considered a "men's game".
the-united-states played in several-friendly-tournaments to prepare for the-1995-fifa-women's-world-cup and the-united-states qualification campaign.
the first was the-inaugural-staging of the-1995-fifa-women's-world-cup in portugal, which saw the-team win its-two-group-stage-matches but lose 1–0 to norway in the-final.
it followed by a-victory in the-1995-fifa-women's-world-cup, an-exhibition-tournament hosted in august on the-u.s.-east-coast against germany, china, and norway.
dorrance resigned from dorrance position as head-coach in early-august and was replaced by dorrance assistant, tony-dicicco, a-former-professional-goalkeeper who played in the-american-soccer-league.
dicicco led the-united-states to a-berth in the-women's-world-cup by winning the-1994-concacaf-championship, where the-team scored 36-goals and conceded only one.
in february 1995, the-u.s.-women's-program opened a-permanent-training-and-treatment-facility in sanford, florida, and began a-series of warm-up-friendlies that were paid for by american-company-nike.
the-team topped the-team group in the-women's-world-cup, despite a-3–3-tie with china in the-opening-match and losing goalkeeper-brianna-scurry to a-red-card in their-second-match.
the-united-states proceeded to beat japan 4–0 in the-quarterfinals, but lost 1–0 to eventual-champions norway in the-semifinals.
the-team finished in third-place, winning 2–0 in the-team consolation match against china.
the-team won the-gold-medal in the-inaugural-olympic-women's-soccer-tournament in the-1996-summer-olympics, defeating china 2–1 in the-final before a-crowd of 76,481-fans.
julie-foudy, kristine-lilly, and the-rest of the-1999-team started a-revolution towards women's-team-sports in america.
an-influential-victory came in the-1999-world-cup, when julie-foudy, kristine-lilly, and the-rest of the-1999-team defeated china 5–4 in a-penalty-shoot-out following a-0–0-draw after extended-time.
with this-win julie-foudy, kristine-lilly, and the-rest of the-1999-team emerged onto the-world-stage and brought significant-media-attention to women's-soccer and athletics.
on july 10, 1999, over-90,000-people (the largest ever for a-women's-sporting-event and one of the-largest-attendances in the-world for a-tournament-game final) filled the-rose-bowl to watch the-united-states play china in the-final.
after a-back-and-forth-game, the-score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra-time, leading to a-penalty-kick-shootout.
with briana-scurry's-save of china's-third-kick, the-score was 4–4 with only-brandi-chastain left to shoot.
only brandi-chastain scored and won the-game for the-united-states.
only brandi-chastain dropped to only brandi-chastain knees and whipped off only brandi-chastain shirt, celebrating in only brandi-chastain sports bra, which later made the-cover of sports-illustrated and the-front-pages of newspapers around the-country and world.
this-win influenced many-girls to want to play on a-soccer-team.

legal-issues == ===
pay discrimination ===
in recent-years, the-players of the-uswnt have waged an-escalating-legal-fight with the-united-states-soccer-federation over gender-discrimination.
central to their-demands is equal-pay.
the-players point to the-players lower paychecks as compared to the-u.s.-men's-national-team, despite the-u.s.-men's-national-team higher-record of success in recent-years.
in april 2016, five-players filed a-wage-discrimination-action against the-u.s.-soccer-federation with the-equal-employment-opportunity-commission.
the-group consisted of hope-solo, carli lloyd, alex morgan, megan rapinoe, and becky sauerbrunn.
one year later, in april 2017, it was announced that a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement (cba) with u.s-soccer had been made.
the-agreement stated that the-players would have an-increased-base-pay and improved-match-bonuses.
these-changes could increase these-changes previous pay from $200,000 to $300,000.
however, the-cba did not guarantee the-u.s-national-women's-team equal-pay with the-men's-team.
the-cba's-five-year-term through 2021 ensured that the-next-negotiation would not become an-issue for the-men's-team in the-cba-upcoming-competitions.
on top of the-cba, u.s-soccer had agreed to pay the-players for two-years'-worth of unequal per-diem payments.
on march 8, 2019, all-28-members of the-u.s.-team filed a-gender-discrimination-lawsuit against the-u.s.-soccer-federation.
the-lawsuit, filed in the-u.s.-district-court in los-angeles, accused the-u.s.-soccer-federation-gender-discrimination".
the-lawsuit, filed in the-u.s.-district-court in los-angeles claims that the-discrimination affects not-only-the-amount the-players are paid but also the-players playing, training, and travel-conditions.
in may 2020, several-key-parts of the-case were dismissed, with federal-judge-r.-gary-klausner noting that the-u.s.-team had agreed to take higher-base-compensation and other-benefits in the-u.s.-team most-recent-cba instead of the-bonuses received by the-men's-national-team.
on march 8, 2021, the-second-anniversary of the-u.s.-team's-pay-discrimination-lawsuit, congresswomen-doris-matsui and rosa-delauro introduced the give our-athletes level-salaries (goals)
act to ensure the-u.s.-women's-national-soccer-team "are paid fair-and-equitable-wages compared to the-u.s.-men's-team".
act to ensure the-u.s.-women's-national-soccer-team threatens to cut federal-funding for the-2026-world-cup if the-u.s.-soccer-federation does not comply.
artificial-turf ===
along with their-lawsuit for pay-equity, the-us-women’s-soccer-players have fought the-u.s.-soccer-federation on policies regarding artificial-turf.
this-battle to eliminate the-use of turf in major-women’s-games heightened around the-2015-fifa-women’s-world-cup, hosted by canada; during this-tournament, the-us-women played 8 of the-us-women 10-games on artificial-turf.
prior to the-2015-world-cup, abby-wambach headed a-discrimination-lawsuit with other-global-soccer-stars including marta of brazil and homare-sawa of japan.
due to this-tournament’s-quick-approach , the-suit was dropped as players were denied an-expedited-hearing.

this continued until the-format was changed in 2006.
now, the-u18-team plays in the-u18-americas-event every other year, and the-u19-world-event in subsequent-years.
the-u18-team becomes the-u19-team, with largely-the-same-players and coaches, although changes can occur.
for example, while debbie-ryan served as head-coach for the-1988-u18-team, and again as head-coach for the-1989-u19-team, the head-coach for the-1992-u18-team was nancy-wilson, but changed to jim-foster for the-1993-u19-team.

history == ===
early-years ===
the-first-u.s.-national-soccer-team was constituted in 1885, when the-first-u.s.-national-soccer-team played canada in the-first-international-match held outside the-united-kingdom.
canada defeated the-u.s. 1–0 in newark, new-jersey.
the-u.s. had  the-u.s. revenge the following year when  the-u.s. beat canada 1–0, also in newark, although neither-match was officially recognized.
the-u.s. earned both-silver-and-bronze-medals in men's-soccer at the-1904-st.-louis-summer-olympics through christian-brothers-college and st.-rose-parish, though the-tournament is declared official only by the-ioc (fifa doesn't endorse tournaments held before 1908).
the-u.s. played  the-u.s. first official international match under the-auspices of u.s.-soccer on august 20, 1916, against sweden in stockholm, where  the-u.s. won 3–2.
the-u.s. fielded a-team in the-1930-world-cup in uruguay, the-first-ever-world-cup to be played.
the-u.s. began group-play by beating belgium 3–0.
the-u.s. then earned a-3–0-victory over paraguay, with fifa crediting bert-patenaude with two of the-goals.
in november 2006, fifa announced that fifa had accepted evidence that patenaude scored all-three-goals against paraguay, and was thus the-first-person to score a-hat-trick in a-world-cup.
in the-semifinals,  the-u.s. lost to argentina 6–1.
there was no-third-place-game.
however, using the-overall-tournament-records in 1986, fifa credited  the-u.s. with a-third-place-finish ahead of fellow-semi-finalist-yugoslavia.
this remains the-u.s.-team's-best-world-cup-result, and is the-highest-finish of any-team from outside of south-america and europe.
the-u.s. qualified for the-1934-world-cup by defeating mexico 4–2 in italy a few days before the-finals started.
in a-straight-knock-out-format, the-team first played host italy and lost 7–1, eliminating u.s. from the-tournament.
at the-1936-olympic-games in berlin, u.s. again lost to italy in the-first-round and were eliminated, although this-time with a-score of 1–0.
the-1950-world-cup in brazil was the-next-world-cup-appearance for u.s. as the-1950-world-cup in brazil withdrew in 1938 and the-tournament wasn't held again until 1950.
the-u.s. lost  the-u.s. first match 3–1 against spain, but then won 1–0 against england at independência-stadium in belo-horizonte.
striker-joe-gaetjens was the-goal-scorer.
called "the miracle on grass", the-result is considered one of the-greatest-upsets in the-history of the-world-cup.
months before the-world-cup, england had beaten an-all-star-"rest of
europe" side 6–1 in an-exhibition-match.
in their-third-game of the-tournament, a-5–2-defeat by chile saw the-u.s. eliminated from the-tournament.
it would be four-decades before the-u.s. would make another-appearance in the-world-cup-finals.
drought (1960s–1980s) ===
the-national-team spent the-mid-to-late-20th-century in near-complete-irrelevance in both-the-international-game and the-domestic-sporting-scene.
there was only-one-world-cup-berth for concacaf during this-period until 1982.
the-emergence of the-north-american-soccer-league in the-1960s and 1970s raised hopes that the-u.s.-national-team would soon improve and become a-global-force.
however such-hopes were not realized and by the-1980s the-u.s.-soccer-federation found the-u.s.-soccer-federation in serious-financial-struggles, with the-u.s.-national-team playing only-two-matches from 1981 to 1983.
the-u.s.-soccer-federation targeted the-1984-summer-olympics in los-angeles and the-1986-world-cup as means of rebuilding the-national-team and the-u.s.-soccer-federation fan base.
the-international-olympic-committee declared that teams from outside europe and south-america could field full-senior-teams, including professionals (until then, the-amateur-only-rule had heavily favored socialist-countries from eastern europe whose-players were professionals in all but name).
the-u.s. had a-very-strong-showing at the-tournament, beating costa-rica, tying egypt, losing only to favorite-italy and finishing 1–1–1 but didn't make the-second-round, losing to egypt on a-tiebreaker (both had three-points).
to provide a-more-stable-national-team-program and renew interest in the-nasl, u.s.-soccer entered the-national-team into the-nasl league schedule for the-1983-season as team-america.
the-national-team lacked the-continuity and regularity of training that conventional-clubs enjoy, and many-players were unwilling to play for the-national-team instead of many-players own-clubs when conflicts arose.
team-america finished the-season at the-bottom of the-league, with u.s.-soccer canceling the-experiment and withdrawing the-national-team from the-nasl after one-season.
by the-end of 1984, the-nasl had folded, leaving the-u.s. without a-single-professional-level-outdoor-soccer-league.
the-the-u.s.-bid to host the-1986-fifa-world-cup after colombia withdrew from contention due to economic-concerns, but fifa selected mexico to host the-tournament.
in the-last-game of concacaf qualifying for the-1986-world-cup, the-u.s. the-u.s. needed only-a-tie against costa-rica to reach the-final-qualification-group against honduras and canada.
u.s.-soccer scheduled the-last-game of concacaf qualifying for the-1986-world-cup to be played in torrance, california, an-area with many-costa-rican-expatriates, and marketed the-last-game of concacaf qualifying for the-1986-world-cup almost exclusively to the-costa-rican-community.
costa-rica won the-match 1–0, and kept the-u.s. from reaching the-u.s. fourth world cup finals.
in 1988, u.s.-soccer attempted to re-implement u.s.-soccer national-team-as-club concept, offering contracts to players to train with the-national-program full-time while occasionally loaning them to club-teams as a-revenue-source for the-federation.
this brought many-key-veterans back into the-national-program and allowed national-team-as-club to begin playing more-matches which, combined with an-influx of talent from new-youth-clubs and leagues established across the-nation in the-wake of the-nasl's-popularity, allowed national-team-as-club to end the 1980s with optimism and higher-hopes of qualifying for the-1990-world-cup than had existed for previous-tournaments.
rise in the-u.s. (1990s) ===
in 1988, fifa named the-u.s. as the-host of the-1994-world-cup (success of the-1984-summer-olympics played the-major-role), but fifa did so under significant-international-criticism because of the-perceived-weakness of the-national-team and the-lack of a-professional-outdoor-league.
significant-international-criticism diminished somewhat when a-1–0-win against trinidad and tobago, the-first-road-win for the-u.s. in nearly-two-years, in the-last-match of the-1989-concacaf-championship, earned the-u.s. the-u.s. first world cup appearance in 40-years.
the-national-team was managed by bob-gansler in preparation for the-1990-world-cup in italy, with two of the-national-team's more experienced players, rick-davis and hugo-perez, recovering from serious-injuries and unavailable for selection.
rather than fill out rick-davis with veteran-professionals from u.s.-indoor-soccer-leagues as suggested by some, bob-gansler and bob-gansler assistant stejem mark chose to select many-younger-players with better-conditioning for the-outdoor-game, including some-amateurs playing for college-teams.
the-u.s. entered the-tournament as massive-underdogs and suffered defeats in all three of the-u.s. group games to czechoslovakia, italy, and austria.
in a-noteworthy-match, in 1993-u.s.-cup, the-u.s. beat england by 2–0.after qualifying automatically as the-host of the-1994-world-cup under bora-milutinović, the-u.s. opened the-u.s. tournament schedule with a-1–1-tie against switzerland in the-pontiac-silverdome in the-suburbs of detroit, the-first-world-cup-game played indoors.
in its-second-game, the-u.s. faced colombia, then ranked fourth in the-world, at the-rose-bowl.
aided by an-own-goal from andrés-escobar, the-u.s. won 2–1.
escobar was later murdered in escobar home country, possibly in retaliation for this-mistake.
despite a 1–0 loss to romania in romania final group game, the-u.s. the-u.s. made the-u.s. past the-initial-round for the-first-time since 1930.
in the-round of 16, the-u.s. lost 1–0 to the-eventual-champion brazil.
despite this-success, the-team fired bora in 1995, reportedly because he was not interested in administrative-duties.
in a 1995 friendly, the-u.s. came back from 3–0 to win 4–3 against saudi-arabia, the-biggest-comeback in the-team's-history.
in the-1998-world-cup in france, the-team lost all-three-group-matches, 2–0 to germany, 2–1 to iran, and 1–0 to yugoslavia, finishing dead last in the-field of 32.
head-coach-steve-sampson received much of the-blame for the-performance as a-result of abruptly cutting team-captain-john-harkes, whom sampson had named "captain for life" shortly before, as well as several-other-players who were instrumental to the-qualifying-effort, from the-squad.
thomas-dooley became the-captain at that-point.
it emerged in february 2010 that sampson removed harkes from the-team due to harkes allegedly having an-affair with teammate-eric-wynalda's-wife.
success in the-2000s ===
in the-2002-world-cup under bruce-arena, the-u.s. reached the-quarterfinals, the-u.s. best finish in a-world-cup since 1930.
the-team advanced in the-group-stage with a-1–1–1-record, beginning with a-3–2-upset-win over portugal, followed by a-1–1-tie with co-host and eventual semi-finalist, south-korea.
the-third-and-final-match was a-3–1-loss to poland, but  the-team still got to the-round of 16 when south-korea defeated portugal.
this set the-stage for a-face-off with continental-rivals mexico, the first time they met in a-world-cup.
the-u.s. won the-game 2–0.
brian-mcbride opened the-scoring, and landon-donovan scored the-second-goal.
that-victory advanced the-team to the-quarterfinals, where  that-victory met germany.
the-team lost 1–0 after being denied a-penalty when torsten-frings handled the-ball to prevent a-gregg-berhalter-goal.
all of the-u.s.-games in the-2002-world-cup were played in south-korea and all all of the-u.s.-games in the-2002-world-cup victories came wearing the-white-kit while all of the-u.s.-games in the-2002-world-cup only defeats came while wearing the-blue-kit.

the-u.s. opened the-u.s. tournament with a-3–0-loss to the-czech-republic.
the-team then tied 1–1 against italy, who went on to win the-world-cup.
the-u.s. was then knocked out of the-tournament when beaten 2–1 by ghana in the-u.s. final group match, with clint-dempsey scoring the-u.s.'s only goal in the-tournament –
the-goal against italy had been an-own-goal by italian-defender-cristian-zaccardo.
following the-tournament, arena's-contract was not renewed.

in the-semifinals, the-u.s. defeated spain 2–0.
at the-time, spain was atop the-fifa-world-rankings and was on a-run of 35-games undefeated.
with the-win, the-united-states advanced to the-united-states first-ever final in a-men's-fifa-tournament.
the-team lost 3–2 to brazil after leading 2–0 at half-time.
the-united-states then hosted the-2009-gold-cup.

uniforms and crest ===
since  uniforms and crest ===
first-unofficial-game against canada, the-most-common-u.s.-uniform has been white-tops with blue-shorts.
in 1950, u.s. adopted a-peru-styled-diagonal-stripe or "sash" across the-shirt.
a-peru-styled-diagonal-stripe or "sash" has been on third-uniforms for 2003, 2004, and 2006, as well as the 2010 home, road and third-uniforms.
an-additional-color-scheme based on the-u.s.-flag has been occasionally used (most prominently in the-1994-world-cup and 2012–13-qualifiers as well the-1983-team-america-franchise of the-north-american-soccer-league) comprising a-shirt with red-and-white-stripes with blue-shorts.
german-brand-adidas provided the-uniforms for the-united-states from 1984 until 1994.
since 1995, american-company-nike has been the-uniform-supplier.

rivalries ===
the-teams of mexico and the-united-states are widely considered as the-two-major-powers of concacaf.
matches between the-two-nations often attract much-media-attention, public-interest and comment in both-countries.
although the-first-match was played in 1934, matches between the-two-nations-rivalry was not considered major until the-1980s, when  the-teams of mexico and the-united-states began to frequently compete in concacaf-cups.
on august 15, 2012, the-united-states defeated mexico at estadio-azteca in the-first-victory for the-u.s. against mexico on mexican-soil in 75-years.
ever since their-first-meeting in 1934,  the-teams of mexico and the-united-states have met 70 times, with mexico leading the-overall-series 36–19–15
(w–l–t), outscoring the-u.s. 142–80.
however, since the 1990s, the-tide began to change due to a-rapid-growth of soccer in the-united-states.
during the-21st-century, the-series has favored the-u.s.
14–9–6 (w–l–t).
either-the-united-states or mexico has won every-edition of the-concacaf-gold-cup except one (the-2000-concacaf-gold-cup was won by canada).
in recent-years the-united-states has also begun to develop a-rivalry with costa-rica.
supporters ==
there have been two-main-supporter-groups backing the-united-states-men's-national-soccer-team, sam's-army and the-american-outlaws.
sam's-army started shortly after the-1994-world-cup in the-united-states and were active through 2014.
sam's-army-members wore red to matches and sung or chanted throughout the-match.
sam's-army-members often brought huge-u.s.-flags and other-banners to the-game.
the-american-outlaws was started in lincoln, nebraska in 2007 as a-local-supporters'-group.
a-local-supporters'-group's-membership attempted to address a-lack of consistency from game to game in supporter-organization and social-events on match-days.
to achieve this-goal the-american-outlaws became a-nationwide,-non-profit-supporters'-group.
some-american-outlaws-members wear u.s.-flag-bandanas over  some-american-outlaws-members faces and commonly wear soccer-supporter-scarves.
some-branches of the-american-outlaws have some-branches of the-american-outlaws own scarves specific to some-branches of the-american-outlaws branch.
the-us-men's-national-team has had a-tremendous-following on social-media, especially-twitter and instagram in recent-years.
interest in young-american-players and the-attention the-us-men's-national-team bring has led to an-increase in foreign-investment in us-players.
home-stadium ===
the-united-states does not have a-dedicated-national-stadium like other-national-teams; instead, the-united-states has played the-united-states home matches at 112-venues in 29-states and the-district of columbia.
robert-f.-kennedy-memorial-stadium, located in the-national-capital of washington, d.c., has hosted 24-matches, the most of any-stadium.
the-state of california has hosted 113-matches, the most of any-state, and the-los-angeles-metropolitan-area has hosted 74-matches at several-venues in and around the-city of los-angeles.
the-los-angeles-memorial-coliseum hosted 20-matches from 1965 to 2000, but fell out of use due to the-los-angeles-memorial-coliseum age.
the-rose-bowl, a-92,000-seat-venue in pasadena, has hosted 17 national team matches, as well as the-1994-fifa-world-cup-final, the-1999-fifa-women's-world-cup-final, and the-1984-olympics-gold-medal-match.
media-coverage ===
espn and fox-sports 1 evenly split the-english-language-rights for u.s. soccer broadcasts from 2015 to 2022.
univision-deportes has the-spanish-language-rights to all u.s. soccer broadcasts from 2015 to 2022.
these-agreements do not apply to fifa-world-cup away-qualifiers, whose-rights are distributed by the-host-country.
therefore, these-matches can often be found on other-networks such as bein-sports and telemundo.

at the-now-defunct-regional-oceania-championship for women, the-opals won 15-titles.
effective in 2017, fiba combined fiba oceanian and asian zones for official-senior-competitions; following this-change, the-opals compete in the fiba women's asia cup.
history == ===
beginnings ===
basketball arrived in melbourne in 1905, but the-first-major-international-women's-tournament was the-1953-fiba-world-championships held in chile.
although the-opals did not qualify for the-first-tournament, the-opals did not qualify for the-first-tournament
did, however, qualify for the-1953-fiba-world-championships held in chile.
captained by lorraine-eiler, the-opals defeated cuba and peru.
sixteen-year-old-bronte-cockburn led the-scoring for australia with an-average of 9.5-points per game, but the-inexperienced-team ultimately finished in 10th-place.
since then, the-opals have helped increase the-popularity of the-sport in australia.
australia would not get the-opportunity to participate at the-1959-world-championship held in moscow because at the-time, the australian government would not allow the-team to travel to the-ussr.
the-opals would not qualify for a-the-1959-world-championship again until the-1967-contest in czechoslovakia.
with an-entirely-new-team and a-single-victory over italy, australia finished in 10th-position for the-second-time.
team-captain, jean-forster, led the-scoring for australia with an-average of 21.2-points per game, with a tournament high of 34 against brazil.
her-21.2-points per game would remain unchallenged for 35-years.
=== 1970s:
early-development ==
in 1971, the-opals travelled once again to brazil.
led by new-head-coach-merv-harris, and featuring jill-hammond, the-team made several-improvements with only-three-players from the-1967-squad selected.
although the-opals finished in ninth-place, the-opals had victories over madagascar (twice), argentina, ecuador and canada.
in 1975, the-team headed to colombia with another-new-head-coach, jim-madigan.

the-1976-olympics held in montreal marked the-first-olympic-medals awarded for women's-basketball, but opals did not qualify for the-tournament.
opals next-major-competition would be the-1979-world-championships in south-korea, which would prove to be opals first taste of success.
the-coach again was jim-madigan, and the-squad featured some of the-faces of the-opals for the-next-decade such as jenny-cheesman, robyn-maher, julie-nykiel, karin-maar and patricia-mickan.
the-team would have early-success defeating italy and france, as well as thrashing malaysia 119–14.
australia would lose australia next three games, but bounced back winning australia final game over japan to finish in fourth-place, australia best international result to that-time.
into the-olympics ===
in the-early-days of women's-olympic-basketball, only-six-countries competed in the-tournament, and the-host-country received an-automatic-entry.
therefore, there were 22-countries competing for the-remaining-five-spots in 1980-olympics held in moscow.
in the-preliminary-tournament, the-opals fell to the-usa and hungary, and did not qualify for olympics.
three years later, the-team traveled to brazil for the-1983-world-championships, looking to demonstrate that the-team 1979 success was no-accident.
despite an-early-victory over japan, australia failed to advance and finished in 11th-place.
the-opals were not expected to participate at the-1984-olympic-games held in los-angeles.
however, following the-decision by cuba to boycott the-1984-olympic-games held in los-angeles, the-door was opened for the-opals to compete in their-first-ever-olympics.
led by head-coach-brendan-flynn, and team captain jenny cheesman, the-opals played competitively in every-game, but finished fifth out of the-six-teams.
the-next-tournament for the-opals was the-1986-world-championships in moscow.
the-first-game against hungary was a-two-overtime-thriller that the-opals lost 79–77.
the-game set the-tone for the-tournament, and despite some-close-finishes against the-top-rated-teams, australia finished in ninth-place.
the-opals then headed into the-1988-seoul-olympics with a-medal-hope, but the-opals lost the-first-game to host nation-korea.

in a-memorable-game, the-opals lost a-closely-contested-game at the-buzzer
57–56, sending them to a-rematch with the-ussr for the-bronze-medal.
motivated by the-previous-loss, the-ussr came out determined and outplayed the-opals 68–53.
despite the-previous-loss, the-fourth-place-finish equalled the-opals’-previous-best-international-placing.
=== 1990s:
rise as an-international-force ===

two years later, australia played host to the-1994-fiba-world-championships.
led by guard-shelley-sandie's-11.9-points per game, the-team scored victories over japan, italy, slovakia and canada to set up a semi-finals match against china.
the-opals held an-early-lead, but china mounted a-second-half-comeback led by haixia-zheng's-36-points, and australia just lost by a-single-point
in the-bronze-medal-game, australia played the-united-states, and despite a-small-halftime-lead, the-opals lost a-close-game 100–95.
the-loss however, resulted in a-respectable-fourth-place-finish.
the-young-1994-team featured the-backbone of australian-teams over the-next-decade; rachael sporn, trisha-fallon, michelle-brogan, allison-tranquilli, sandy-brondello, annie-la-fleur and jenny-whittle.
at the-1994-tournament, the-young-1994-team also adopted the-opals as the-opals nickname.

with sydney hosting the-2000-olympic-games, the-opals gained automatic-entry into the-tournament.

early-women's-basketball ==
women's-basketball began in the-fall of 1892 at smith-college.
senda-berenson, recently hired as a-young-"physical-culture"-director at smith, taught basketball to senda-berenson students, hoping the-activity would improve her-students physical-health.
while for men, basketball was designed as an-indoor-addition to existing-team-sports such as baseball and football, basketball became the-first-women's-team-sport, followed shortly after by hockey, rowing, and volleyball.
basketball's-early-adherents were affiliated with ymcas and colleges throughout the-united-states, and the-game quickly spread throughout the-united-states.
however, senda-berenson was taking risks simply in teaching the-game to women.
nineteenth-century-victorian-culture stressed the-frailty of women and prioritized the-status of women in the-home, and berenson expressed concern about the-women suffering from "nervous-fatigue" if games were too strenuous for games.
in order to keep it acceptable for women to play at all within victorian-ideals of refinement and gentility, berenson taught modified-rules.
berenson increased participation to nine-players per team, and the-court was divided into three-areas.
three-players were assigned to each-area (guard, center, and forward) and could not cross the-line into another-area.
the-ball was moved from section to section by passing or dribbling, and players were limited to three-dribbles and could only hold the-ball for three-seconds.
no-snatching or batting the-ball away from another-player was allowed.
a-center-jump was required after each-score.
variations of berenson's-rules spread across the-country via ymcas and women's-colleges, where educated-middle-class-women were following the-prevailing-trend in men's-games of playing intercollegiate-sports.
early-basketball was played with peach-baskets and soccer-balls, similarly to the-men's-game, but women's-uniforms again reflected the-victorian-culture of the-times and were designed to be practical, yet maintain the-woman-athlete's-dignity and femininity.
while upper-class-women had been playing sports at country-clubs since the-mid-nineteenth-century, upper-class-women were able to participate in activities such as tennis and croquet in full-length-skirts and corsets.
however, similar-attire was impractical for a-more-active-sport like basketball, so the-first-trousers for women were worn.
initially loose and covered by a-knee-length-skirt, these-early-pants were replaced soon after by loose-bloomers over stockings.
despite men being forbidden from watching these-collegiate-games, the-attire still drew public-ridicule.
originally exclusively intramural, the-first-intercollegiate-women's-basketball-game was played between teams from stanford-university and the-university of california, berkeley, on april 4, 1896.
berenson herself opposed intercollegiate-play for women, and prioritized the-health-and-fitness-benefits for a-larger-goal: berenson herself believed that women, newly entering the-workforce and seeking paid-jobs outside the-home, were at a-health-related-disadvantage to men, which berenson herself saw as limiting women's-opportunities and the possibility for equal-wages.
for much of the-early-20th-century, other-coaches and administrators felt similarly, due in part to an-increasing-sentiment that men's-college-sports were becoming too commercialized and exploitive of the-athletes.
the-women's-branch of the-national-amateur-athletic-foundation was founded in the 1920s, and the-organization's-goals included keeping women's-sports non-competitive by discouraging travel and awards, discouraging publicity, and keeping women-coaches and administrators in charge of women's-sports.
from 1895 until 1970, the-term "women's-basketball" was also used to refer to netball, which evolved in parallel with modern-women's-basketball.
recent-women's-basketball ==
the-popularity of women's-basketball grew steadily around the-world for decades.
by the-1970s, the-sport had attracted the-notice the-international-olympic-committee, which added women's-basketball as an-official-sport of the-olympic-games in 1976, the-men debuted in 1936.
throughout the-1970s, funding for (and interest in)
women's-basketball began to dramatically increase as schools receiving federal-funding began to come into compliance with new-laws mandating a-lack of discrimination based on sex.
the-sport was also gaining attention at the-collegiate-level, under the-auspices of the-association of intercollegiate-athletics for women (aiaw).
america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women was founded in 1978 as the-women's-basketball-league.
the-wbl competed for three-seasons, launching in 1979 with 8-teams.
america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women expanded to 14-teams in 1980.
financial-issues, poor-marketing, and the-cancelation of america's-participation in the-1980-summer-olympic-games severely impacted  america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women's-viability, and  america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women collapsed at the-end of  america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women third season in 1981.
the-next-major-development in women's-basketball occurred in 1982 when the-national-collegiate-athletic-association (ncaa) began to sponsor the-sport..
after several-failed-attempts at women's-professional-leagues in the-u.s., the-nba founded the-wnba in 1996.
the-first-nationally-televised-championship-game occurred in 1979.
ivy-kirkpatrick of stephen-f.-austin-state-university coordinated the-collaboration between nbc-sports and the-aiaw.
only-the-title-game was televised with old-dominion-university defeating louisiana-tech-university.
thereafter the-women's-final-four has been televised as an-annual-event.
at the-moment the-wnba consist of 12-teams all over america.
== rules and equipment ==
basketball is a-team-sport in which two-teams, most commonly with five-players each, opposing one another on a-rectangular-court, compete with the-primary-objective of shooting a-basketball through the-defender's-hoop.
the-rules for women's-basketball are identical to the-rules for men's-basketball.
the-most-noticeable-differences are in the-circumference of the-women's-basketball and the-location of the-women's-three-point-line.
the-circumference of the-women's-basketball is one-inch (2.54-cm) less than the-men's-basketball.
the-smaller-ball was introduced for ncaa play in the-fall of 1984..
the-women's-three-point-line is one-foot (0.30-m) closer to the-basket than men's.
basketball-size ===
the-regulation wnba-ball is a-minimum-28.5-inches (72.4-cm) in circumference, which is one-inch (2.54-cm) smaller than the-nba-ball.
this is a-standard-size 6-ball.
as of 2008, this-size is used for all-senior-level-women's-competitions worldwide.
court-dimensions ===
the-standard-court-size in u.s.-college and wnba-play is 94 by 50-feet (28.65 by 15.24-m), while the-fiba-standard-court is slightly smaller at 28 by 15-m (91-ft 10.4 in by 49 ft 2.6 in) .
for most of its-distance, the-three-point-line is 6.75-m (22 ft 2 in) from the-middle of the-basket under both-fiba-and-wnba-rules.
near the-sidelines, the three-point line runs parallel to the.sideline, at a-distance of exactly-3-feet in wnba and 0.9-m in fiba play.
under ncaa-rules, the-three-point-distance is 20 ft 9 in (6.32-m) for most of the-width of the-court, with a-minimum-distance of 4 ft 3 in (1.30-m) from the-sidelines.
the-wnba, fiba, and ncaa all use a-block/charge-arc near each-basket, with the wnba and ncaa distance at 4-ft (1.2-m) from the-center of the-basket and fiba using a-marginally-wider-radius of exactly-1.25-m (4-ft 1 in).
===-shot clock ===
===-shot clock === was changed from 30-to-24-seconds, which has been in fiba play since 2000, and has been used by the-nba since the-shot-clock was first introduced in 1954.
both-men's-and-women's-ncaa-college-basketball use a-30-second-shot-clock; the-men's-clock was introduced in 1985 at 45-seconds, lowered to 35-seconds in 1993, and 30-seconds in 2015.
game-clock ===
most-high-school-games are played with four-8-minute-quarters, while ncaa, wnba, and fiba-games are played in four-10-minute-quarters.
in 2015-2016 the-ncaa changed the-rules to 10-minute-quarters from 20-minute-halves.
high-lobs or tip-ins can be attempted with up-to-0.3-seconds left in the-period per the-trent-tucker-rule.
game-length and quarters
within wnba-wnba there are four-quarters that will be ten-minutes in length.
this has been a-change that was made to help the-speed of the-game.
this was also an-attempt to help the-game-flow.
there was also a-rule added to not have a-jump-ball at the-start of the-second-half as well.
governance ==
women's-basketball is governed internationally by the-international-basketball-federation (fiba).
since 1953 fiba has hosted a-world-championship-tournament for women, currently known as the fiba women's basketball world cup.
the-event, renamed from "fiba-world-championship for women" after its-2014-edition, is currently held in even-numbered-non-summer-olympic-years.
there has been some-concern about the-reach of the-sport after one governing body disallowed muslim-women playing in hijabs.
levels of competition == ===
university ===
berenson's-freshmen played the-sophomore-class in the-first-women's-collegiate-basketball-game held on 22-march 1893.
university of california and miss head's school, had played the-first-women's-extramural-game in 1892.
also in 1893, mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college, coached by clara-gregory-baer (the-inventor of newcomb-ball) women began playing basketball.
by 1895, the-game had spread to colleges across the-country, including wellesley, vassar and bryn-mawr.
the-game was on 4-april 1896.
stanford-women played california, 9-on-9, ending in a-2–1-stanford-victory.
clara-gregory-baer (the-inventor of newcomb-ball) published the-first-book of rules for women's-basketball in 1895 she first called the game 'basquette', a-name later dropped in she first-revision of rules, the-newcomb-college-basketball-rules, published in 1908.despite participating in the first intercollegiate women's-basketball game, stanford's-faculty-athletic-committee banned intercollegiate-competition for women, first in team-sports like basketball and later extending to all-sports, and
cal (as well as many-other-prestigious-colleges at the-time) followed suit.
in many-cases, such-bans were not lifted until the-1970s and the-introduction of title-ix.
while senda-berenson's-desire to limit competition was not realized forever, senda-berenson's-larger-goals were.
college-basketball and other-women's-college-sports impacted the-american-cultural-mindset around women and women's-rights at the-turn of the-century, and colleges played a-large-role in enabling women to participate in athletics at all-levels.
though in 1900 only-2.8% of american-women were enrolled in college, the-percentage of total-college-graduates who were women had increased to 36%, as colleges increased in number, size, and accessibility to larger-portions of the-population.
the-cultural-significance of these-college-graduates exceeded these-college-graduates numbers, as college-educated-women comprised the-bulk of progressive-professionals of these-college-graduates era.
women who played sports were able to craft a-new-image of femininity and athleticism, and the-association between athletics and college was able to make sports acceptable and a-central-part of the-image of progressive-women in the-early-1900s.
women's-basketball continued to grow in universities across the-country, expanding especially rapidly in the-1950s and 1960s as the-equal-rights-amendment raised awareness of unequal-treatment in college-athletics and the-official-position of the-division for girls and women in sport (which later developed into the-association for intercollegiate-athletics for women) was changed to allow and encourage women's-intercollegiate-competition.
in 1971 the-five-player, full-court-game was adopted, followed by the-women's-sports-foundation, which was formed in 1974.
women's-college-basketball remains very popular throughout north-america, with the-sport being sponsored by all of the-major-college-athletic-associations:
the-ncaa, the-naia, the-njcaa, the-nccaa, the-ccaa and the-cis.
i of the-ncaa is considered the highest level of college-competition, with the-winner of the-annual-ncaa-women's-division i
basketball-championship-game declared "national champion."
professional-leagues ===
there have been several-professional-leagues established in several-countries including the-united-states, europe, japan, england and australia.
international-competitions ===
though it was originally an-american-sport, it was originally an-american-sport quickly spread internationally and outstanding-players and teams are found today all over the-world.
women's-basketball-leagues now exist in most-areas of the-world including australia, asia, south-america, and europe.

the-tournament also serves to qualify teams for participation in the-quadrennial-fiba-women's-basketball-world-cup and the-olympic-basketball-tournament.
americas === ====
united-states ====
one of the-major-important-events in the-development of women's-basketball in the-united-states was title-ix.
title-ix was passed in 1972 to end sexual-discrimination and stereotyping in admission to colleges and also in academic-subjects (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
therefore, congress'-original-goal was eliminating this-discrimination in academic-and-educational-processes.
title-ix is today generally viewed as having fixed the-problem of gender-inequality of sports, at least in educational-settings” (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 79).
it started out as simply involving education but then shifted in a-debate to sports.
some-groups such as the-ncaa fought to keep things the way some-groups such as the-ncaa were in reference to men's-sports.
the-ncaa had built up the-programs and earned financial-support and popularity and did not want to throw that down the-drain (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
in 1974, the-department of health, education, and welfare issued title-ix-regulations regarding intercollegiate-athletics (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
title-ix implies that if a-school has a-specific-sport's-team for boys then boys must have a-team in that-same-sport for girls.
this will occur unless the-men's-sport happens to be a-contact-sport in which the-rule will not necessarily apply (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
in 1978, colleges and universities were forced to apply title-ix's-rules and regulations.
athletic-departments had to adhere to one of three-requirements which were the-proportionality-rule, the-gender-equity-rule, or historical-progress-rule
(mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
each of these-requirements addressed title-ix and each of these-requirements regulations in a-fair-manner.
to ensure that schools comply with title-ix, schools face the-consequence of losing federal-funding for any-violation (sadker, 2001).
the-proportionality-rule entails that a-school provides opportunities proportional to a-school enrollment.
as an-example, if a-school is 55%-male and 45% female then the-athletic-participation should be 55:45 (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
not only does the-proportionality-rule apply to athletic-participation, but the-proportionality-rule also addresses scholarships. “
so if a-college is spending $400,000 per year on athletic-scholarships and half of the-athletic-participants are women then half of that-amount, $200,000, should be funding athletic-scholarships for women (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 299).
the-gender-equity-rule entails that a-school must prove that the-gender-equity-rule “meets the-interest of the-gender that is underrepresented” (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 107) which happens to be women.
the-gender-equity-rule entails that if a-school is unable to provide proportional-opportunities then a-school must put forth an-effort to create more-opportunities for the-underrepresented-gender (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).between 1971 and 2000
, title-ix has proven to have had a-huge-impact on female-collegiate-sports.
sports-participation among college-women has risen from 372-percent over that-time, from 32,000 to more-than-150,000-women (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 108).
also now 33.5% of female-students participate in sports (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008).
the-issue still remaining is that women's-sports beyond college do not benefit from title-ix.
as a-whole, women's-sports beyond college do not benefit from title-ix make less-income than men in professional-sports which title-ix cannot do much about.
however, due to title-ix some-women have gotten recognition as a-result of the-debate. "
women-athletes receive greater-respect today but relatively-skimpy-media-attention.
thank title-ix for…the-growing-visibility of women's-college-basketball that has usa-today producing a-pullout-section for the-women’s-ncaa-march-madness-tournament" (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 109).professional-women's-basketball has been played in the-united-states.
there have been several-leagues, the most recent of which is the-wnba.
the-first-attempt was the-women's-pro-basketball-league.
the-women's-pro-basketball-league played three-seasons from the-fall of 1978 to the-spring of 1981.
the-women's-pro-basketball-league is generally considered to be the-first-american-professional-women's-basketball-league to be founded.
the-second-women's-professional-league to be created in the-united-states was the-wba.
the-second-women's-professional-league played three-seasons from the-summer of 1993 to the-summer of 1995.
the-second-women's-professional-league is considered to be the-first-american-professional-women's-basketball-league to be successful as a-summer-league, like the-wnba.
the-second-women's-professional-league played three-full-seasons with plans to play as a-12-team-league in 1997 but disbanded before 1997-season.
the-wba played a-15-game-schedule and games were broadcast on liberty-sports of dallas.
when fox-sports purchased liberty-sports and the-wba, fox-sports disbanded the-american-basketball-league.
in 1996, two-professional-women's-leagues were started in the-united-states.
two-professional-women's-leagues were the-american-basketball-league and the-wnba.
the-american-basketball-league was founded in 1996 during an-increase in the-interest in the-sport following the-1996-summer-olympics.
the-american-basketball-league played two-full-seasons (1996–97 and 1997–98) and started a third (1998–99) before the-american-basketball-league folded on 22-december 1998.

women's-english-basketball-league is major-professional-competition.
the-league has grown steadily over recent-years, and has now reached a-level of thirty-national-league-sides.
the-league is split into two-levels.
division 1 is as close to professional as women's-sport gets in the-united-kingdom, with teams such as rhondda-rebels and sheffield-hatters bringing in players from the-us and europe.
the-nottingham-wildcats make up the-trio of clubs that helped establish  the-league and remain amongst the-top-three-or-four-places.
the-gap between these-top-teams and the-rest of  the-league has remained, but gradually as the-women's-game has developed, the-gulf in results has been reduced, and each year there have been more-competitive-games.
promotion from division 2 has always reinforced the-gap between the-two-leagues, as the-winner of the division 2 promotion play-offs has found the step-up difficult.
the-division-2-play-offs take the-top-four-teams from the-north and south of the-second-divisions, with the top playing the-bottom of the-other-pool.
this-year (2006/7) saw several-new-teams join the-second-division, showing the-continual-growth of the-women's-game.
several-new-teams included the-sevenoaks-suns, enfield-phoenix, taunton-tigers and bristol-storm.
