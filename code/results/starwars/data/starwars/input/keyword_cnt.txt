643	for	1	example,	1	instead	1	of	2	opening	1	the-film	1	with	2	a-montage	1	clone-war-battles,	1	lucas	3	decided	1	to	2	focus	1	on	1	anakin,	1	ending	1	the-first-act	1	killing	1	count-dooku,	1	an-action	1	that	1	signals	1	turn	1	the-dark-side.	1

659	thus,	1	in	1	the-version	1	that	1	made	1	it	1	to	3	theaters,	1	anakin	1	falls	1	the-dark-side	1	primarily	1	save	1	padmé.	1
660	over	1	a-period	1	of	2	months,	1	lucas	1	would	2	approve	1	hundreds	1	designs	1	that	1	eventually	1	appear	1	in	1	the-film.	1

1705	a-major-plot-point	1	in	1	the-last-jedi	1	is	1	that	1	the-first-order	1	has	1	developed	1	new-"hyperspace-tracking"-technology,	1	allowing	1	hyperspace	2	tracking	1	to	3	continue	1	chase	1	enemy-vessels	1	through	1	from	1	one-jump	1	the	2	next	1	(until	1	one	1	or	1	other	1	runs	1	out	1	of	1	fuel).	1

2622	lucas	2	similarly	1	stated	1	in	2	an-interview	1	with	1	starlog-magazine	1	september	1	1981	1	that	1	had	1	the-nine-film-series	1	plotted,	1	but:	1	...	1

2626	by	1	1981,	1	lucas	1	had	1	decided	1	to	1	make	1	only-one-star-wars-trilogy.	1
2627	according	1	to	1	gary-kurtz,	1	details	1	of	2	elements	1	from	1	the-discarded-sequel-trilogy	1	which	1	were	1	incorporated	1	into	1	return	1	the-jedi	1	include:	1
2628	luke-skywalker	1	becomes	1	a-full-fledged-jedi-knight.	1
2629	the-emperor	1	would	2	first	1	appear	1	and	1	luke	1	confront	1	the-emperor.	1
2630	through	1	the-1980s,	1	lucas	3	variously	1	hinted	1	at	1	plot-elements	1	from	2	abandoned	1	sequel-trilogy,	1	which	1	said	1	would	1	have	2	revolved	1	around	1	moral-and-philosophical-problems,	1	including	1	distinguishing	1	right	1	wrong,-justice,-confrontation,	1	and	1	passing	1	on	1	what	1	you	1	learned.	1
2631	ideas	1	which	1	seem	1	to	1	have	1	been	1	used	1	in	2	disney's-sequel-trilogy	1	include:	1	episode-vii	1	would	1	begin	1	20–40	1	years	1	after	1	the-end	1	of	2	return	1	the-jedi	1	(lucas	1	1980	1	and	1	1982).	1
2632	r2-d2	1	and	2	c-3po	1	would	1	be	1	the-only-characters	1	to	1	appear	1	in	2	all-nine-films	1	(per	1	lucas	1	1980,	1	1981,	1	1983).	1
2633	(lucas	1	in	2	1983)	1	stated	1	1980	1	that	1	"what	1	happens	1	to	1	luke	1	...	1	is	1	much	1	more	1	ethereal.	1
2634	hamill	2	said	1	in	1	1983	1	that	1	if	1	character	1	were	1	to	1	return	1	again,	1	it	1	would	1	be	1	"on	1	another-plane	1	of	1	existence,	1	or	1	not-the-same-character.	1	"	1
2635	include:	1	disney's-sequel	1	trilogy	1	would	1	deal	1	with	1	the-rebuilding	1	of	1	the-republic	1	(lucas	1	in	1	1980).	1
2636	luke	1	would	1	have	1	a-romantic-relationship	1	with	1	a-female-partner	1	(lucas	1	in	2	1988).timothy-zahn,	1	who	1	wrote	1	the-legends-non-canonical-thrawn-trilogy	1	of	1	novels,	1	was	2	interviewed	1	about	1	disney's-sequel-trilogy	2	after	1	development	1	by	1	disney	1	announced	1	2012.	1
2637	luke	3	confirmed	1	that	2	it	1	was	1	never	1	meant	1	to	1	be	1	based	1	on	2	thrawn	1	trilogy	1	nor	1	the-rest	1	of	1	the-expanded-universe,	1	and	1	said	1	had	1	been	1	briefed	1	years	1	before	1	lucas's-plans	1	for	1	the-sequels:	1
2638	the-original-idea	1	as	1	i	1	understood	1	it—and	1	lucas	2	changes	1	mind	1	off	1	and	1	on,	1	so	1	it	2	may	1	not	1	be	2	what	1	lucas's	1	thinking	1	right	1	now—but	1	was	1	going	1	to	1	three-generations.	1
2639	in	1	1992,	1	lucas	2	announced	1	intentions	1	to	1	produce	1	a-prequel-trilogy.	1
2640	when	1	asked,	1	lucas	3	would	2	frequently	1	repeat	1	that	2	had	1	no-plans	1	to	2	make	2	a-prequel-trilogy	1	and	1	not	1	allow	1	other-directors	1	it.	1
2641	at	1	a-press-conference	1	for	1	the-1997-special-edition	1	of	1	the-original-trilogy,	1	lucas	1	stated,	1	"i	1	don't	1	have	1	scripts	1	[for	1	a-prequel-trilogy].	1
2642	i	1	really	1	don't	1	have	1	any-notion	1	other	1	than,	1	'gee,	1	it	1	would	1	be	1	interesting	1	to	1	do	1	luke-skywalker	1	later	1	on.'	1
2643	on	1	the-possibility	1	of	1	someone	1	else	1	making	1	star-wars-films,	1	lucas	1	said,	1	"probably	1	not,	1	it's	1	my-thing.	1	"	1
2644	in	1	august	1	1999,	1	at	1	a-press-conference	1	to	2	discuss	1	the-phantom-menace,	1	lucas	1	described	1	the-"nine-year-commitment"	1	required	1	make	1	a-star-wars-trilogy.	1
2645	in	2	2002,	1	lucas	1	said:	1	"basically	1	what	1	i	1	said	1	as	1	a-joke	1	was,	1	'maybe	1	when	1	harrison	2	and	3	carrie	2	are	1	70s,	1	we'll	1	come	1	back	1	do	1	another-version.'	1
2646	"in	1	2007	1	,	1	lucas	2	described	1	making	1	the-films	1	at	2	that-age	1	as	2	"an-idea	1	that	2	seemed	1	amusing	1	the-time,	1	but	1	doesn't	1	seem	1	realistic	1	now",	1	and	1	suggested	1	"off-the-cuff"	1	comments	1	had	2	made	1	in	1	earlier-years	1	been	1	misconstrued	1	absolute-statements.	1
2647	in	1	2008,	1	after	1	all-six-films	1	had	1	been	1	released,	1	lucas	1	said:	1	"the-movies	1	were	1	the-story	1	of	1	anakin-skywalker	1	and	3	luke-skywalker,	1	when	1	luke	2	saves	1	the-galaxy	1	redeems	1	father,	1	that's	1	where	1	that-story	1	ends.	1
2648	in	1	another-2008-interview,	1	lucas	2	ruled	1	out	1	anybody	1	else	1	making	1	star-wars-films,	1	and	1	added	1	that	1	the-expanded-universe	1	did	1	not	1	line	1	up	1	with	1	vision.	1
2649	in	2	may	1	2011,	1	lucas	1	was	1	orlando,	1	florida,	1	to	1	celebrate	1	the-opening	1	of	1	star-tours	1	–	1
2650	the-adventures	3	was	1	invited	1	to	3	breakfast	1	by	1	disney-ceo-bob-iger,	1	who	1	asked	1	lucas	1	if	1	would	1	be	1	willing	1	sell	1	company	1	disney.	1
2651	lucas	1	had	1	begun	1	to	2	consider	1	retiring,	1	but	1	was	1	not	1	ready	1	do	1	so	1	at	1	that-time.	1
2652	lucas	3	considered	1	directing	1	episode	1	vii	1	for	1	a-may-2015-release	1	and	1	then	1	selling	1	company,	1	but	1	decided	1	to	1	leave	1	the-franchise	1	in	2	the-hands	1	of	1	other-filmmakers,	1	announcing	1	january	1	2012	1	that	1	would	1	step	1	away	1	from	1	making	1	blockbuster-films.	1
2653	in	1	early	1	2012,	1	after	1	being	1	disappointed	1	by	1	the-weak-performance	1	of	1	red-tails,	1	lucas	2	announced	1	to	2	the-new-york-times	1	that	1	was	1	planning	1	retire.	1
2654	while	1	lucas	2	was	1	in	1	new-york,	1	asked	1	kathleen-kennedy	1	to	1	lunch.	1
2655	lucas	1	asked	1	if	1	kathleen-kennedy	2	would	1	be	1	a-co-chair	1	at	1	lucasfilm	1	with	2	lucas,	1	the-intention	1	of	1	transferring	1	leadership	1	entirely	1	to	1	after	1	about-a-year.	1
2656	she	1	began	1	working	1	for	1	him	1	on	2	june	1	1,	1	2012;	1	lucas	1	soon	1	proposed	1	that	1	they	1	work	1	together	1	the-sequel-trilogy.	1
2657	after	1	making	1	an-appearance	1	at	1	star-wars-celebration-vi	1	in	1	late-august,	1	lucas	1	took	1	mark-hamill	3	and	4	carrie-fisher	3	to	2	lunch	1	asked	1	if	1	would	1	be	1	willing	1	reprise	1	roles	1	for	1	the-new-films.	1
2658	mark-hamill	1	and	1	carrie-fisher	1	agreed,	1	as	1	did	1	harrison-ford	1	after	1	being	1	promised	1	that	1	han-solo	1	would	1	be	1	given	1	meaningful-closure.	1
2659	lucas	4	hoped	1	to	1	explain	1	concepts	1	had	1	imagined	1	when	1	originally	1	drafted	1	saga	1	in	1	the-1970s.	1
2660	most	1	specifically	1	lucas	1	revealed	1	the-"symbiotic-relationships"	1	between	1	the-jedi,	1	the-force,	1	midi-chlorians-(microscopic-lifeforms,	1	first	2	mentioned	2	onscreen	1	in	2	1999's-the-phantom-menace),	1	and	1	the-whills	1	(all-powerful-creatures	1	the-title	1	of	3	the-original-outline	1	star-wars,	1	journal	1	the-whills):	1
2661	by	1	june	1	2012,	1	lucas	2	had	1	agreed	1	to	1	sell	1	company,	1	provided	1	that	1	kennedy	2	would	1	replace	1	as	1	president	1	of	1	lucasfilm.	1
2662	lucas	1	gave	1	kennedy	2	the-final-draft	1	of	1	story	1	treatments	1	during	1	the-october-2012-sale.	1
2663	the	1	same	1	month,	1	the-disney-sale	1	and	1	production	1	of	1	the-sequel-trilogy,	1	as	2	well	1	a-2015-release-date	1	for	1	a-new-film,	1	were	1	announced	1	to	1	the-public.	1
2664	lucas	1	stated,	1	"i	1	always	1	said	1	i	1	wasn't	1	going	2	to	2	do	2	any	2	more,	1	and	1	that's	1	true,	1	because	1	i'm	1	not	1	more.	1
2665	in	1	january	1	2013,	1	lucas	1	held	1	the-first-story-briefing	1	about	1	the-as-yet-untitled-episode-vii	1	at	1	skywalker-ranch.	1
2666	lucas	1	also	1	considered	1	thea	1	and	1	winkie	1	as	1	potential-names	1	for	1	the-character.	1
2667	in	2	at-least-one-conception,	1	skylar	1	was	1	the-son	1	of	3	han-solo	1	and	2	leia-organa,	1	ultimately	1	fell	1	to	1	the-dark-side	1	the-force	1	(these-plot-developments	1	were	1	retained	1	for	1	the-backstory	1	ben-solo/kylo-ren	1	the-final-iteration).	1

2669	lucas	1	planned	1	for	1	luke	1	to	1	die	1	in	1	episode-viii.	1
2670	conversely,	1	in	1	2018,	1	hamill	1	said	1	that	1	lucas-original-vision	1	for	1	the-ending	1	of	2	episode-ix	1	was	1	to	1	have	1	luke	2	die	2	then	1	instead	1	making	1	a-simple-cameo,	1	leaving	1	sister	1	leia	1	as	1	a-jedi.	1

3549	visual-effects-studio-industrial-light	1	&	1	magic,	1	a-subsidiary	1	of	1	lucasfilm,	1	opened	1	a-new-division	1	in	1	november	1	2018	1	called	1	ilm	1	tv,	1	specifically	1	intended	1	for	1	episodic-and-streaming-television.	1
3550	but	1	on	1	the-mandalorian	2	utilized	1	a-21-foot-tall-(6.4-m)-set	1	that	1	was	1	75-feet	1	(23-m)	1	in	1	diameter,	1	surrounded	1	by	1	a-360-degree-semicircular-led-video-wall	1	and	1	ceiling.	1
3551	favreau	1	knew	1	that	1	music	1	would	1	be	2	important	1	to	3	the-series	2	due	1	the-impact	1	of	2	john-williams'-score	1	on	1	the-star-wars-films,	1	but	1	also	1	wanted	1	the-music	1	different	1	from	1	the-star-wars-films.	1
3552	favreau	1	wanted	1	the-series	1	to	1	sound	1	"a	1	little	3	grittier,	1	a	2	edgier	1	and	1	more	1	tech-oriented".	1
3553	composer-ludwig-göransson	1	first	1	met	1	with	1	favreau	3	in	1	november	1	2018,	1	when	1	showed	1	the-composer-concept-art	1	for	2	the-series	1	and	2	discussed	1	inspirations	1	the-story	1	tone,	1	including	1	western-and-samurai-films.	1
3554	they	3	also	1	discussed	1	how	1	felt	1	when	1	first	1	heard	1	john-williams'-star-wars-music,	1	and	2	composer-ludwig-göransson	1	set	1	out	1	to	1	recreate	1	those-feelings	1	"capture	1	the-soul	1	of	1	what	1	star-wars	1	is"	1	but	1	in	1	a-new-way.	1
3555	göransson	1	was	1	announced	1	as	1	composer	1	for	1	the-series	1	in	1	december	1	2018.	1
3556	one	1	of	2	the-primary-themes	1	the-mandalorian	2	is	1	parenting	1	and	2	fatherhood,	1	particularly	1	through	1	the-father–son-relationship	1	dynamic	1	between	1	the-child.	1
3557	ryan-britt	1	of	4	fatherly	1	wrote	1	that	1	this	1	is	1	unusual	1	in	3	star-wars-stories,	1	and	1	that-past-examples	1	parenting	1	the-franchise	1	have	1	tended	1	to	2	be	1	poor-ones,	1	from	1	the-murderous-darth-vader	1	(father	1	luke-skywalker)	1	the-neglectful-galen-erso,	1	father	1	jyn-erso	1	rogue	1	one	1	(2016).	1
3558	ryan-britt	1	of	1	fatherly	1	wrote:	1	"for	1	years	1	the-franchise	1	avoided	1	depicting	1	a-parent-child-dynamic.	1
3559	as	2	examples,	1	vulture-writer-kathryn-vanarendonk	2	cited	1	obi-wan-kenobi	1	serving	1	a-mentor	1	to	1	the-adolescent-anakin-skywalker,	1	princess-leia	1	lamenting	1	over	1	grown	1	son	1	kylo-ren,	1	or	1	the-absence	1	of	1	rey's-parents.	1
3560	vulture-writer-kathryn-vanarendonk	1	argued	1	strong-parental-examples	1	in	1	star-wars	1	are	1	important	1	because	1	the-franchise	2	is	1	so	1	often	1	associated	1	with	1	the-childhoods	1	of	1	fans.	1
3561	the-mandalorian	1	particularly	1	highlights	1	the-challenges	1	of	2	being	1	a-single-parent,	1	and	2	a-working-parent,	1	as	3	the	1	mandalorian	1	struggles	1	to	1	continue	1	his-day-job	1	a-bounty-hunter	1	mercenary	1	while	1	serving	1	the-sole-caretaker	1	the-child.	1
3562	several-reviewers	1	have	1	compared	1	the	1	dynamic	1	between	1	the-child	1	and	3	the-mandalorian	1	to	1	lone-wolf	2	cub,	1	a-manga	1	about	1	a-samurai-warrior	1	young	1	son.	1
3563	the-mandalorian's-parental-role	1	in	2	the-series	1	makes	1	him	2	a	1	softer	1	and	2	more	1	relatable	1	character;	1	changes	1	a-positive-way	1	because	1	of	1	raising	1	the-child,	1	becoming	1	less	1	selfish	1	self-absorbed.	1
3564	when	1	the-mandalorian	1	seeks	1	work	1	to	2	earn	1	money,	1	him	1	is	1	now	1	doing	1	so	1	provide	1	not	1	only	1	for	2	him,	1	but	1	the-child	1	as	1	well.	1
3565	in	2	another-example,	1	the-mandalorian	1	establishes	1	a-car-seat	1	for	1	the-child	1	the-cockpit	1	of	1	him-ship,	1	so	1	him	1	can	1	be	1	seated	1	safely	1	and	1	comfortably	1	during	1	their-travels.	1
3566	the-relationship	1	between	1	the-mandalorian	1	and	1	the-child	1	is	1	an-example	1	of	1	unexpected-fatherhood.	1
3567	the-mandalorian	4	feels	1	a-connection	1	and	2	parental-bond	1	with	1	the-child	1	because	1	of	2	own	1	childhood,	1	when	1	was	2	orphaned	1	upon	1	the-death	1	parents	1	adopted	1	by	1	the-mandalorian-culture	1	as	1	a-"foundling".	1
3568	nevertheless,	1	fatherhood	2	is	1	not	1	a-role	1	the-mandalorian	1	initially	1	seeks,	1	and	1	makes	1	repeated-initial-attempts	1	to	1	avoid	1	this-responsibility.	1
3569	the-mandalorian	2	does	1	not	1	fully	1	commit	1	to	2	the-role	1	of	1	fatherhood	1	until	1	the-first-season-finale,	1	"chapter	1	8:	1	redemption",	1	when	1	the-child	2	is	2	also	1	adopted	1	into	1	the-mandalorian-culture	1	as	1	a-"foundling"	1	and	1	formally	1	declared	1	be	1	father	1	figure.	1
3570	some-observers	1	have	1	criticized	1	the-series	1	for	2	the-fact	1	that	2	the-mandalorian	1	repeatedly	1	leaves	1	the-child	1	alone	1	or	1	in	1	the-hands	1	of	1	relative-strangers,	1	as	2	well	1	making	1	decisions	1	place	1
3571	an-interaction	1	the-mandalorian	1	has	1	with	1	peli-motto	1	in	1	"chapter	1	5:	1
3572	when	1	the-mandalorian	2	accidentally	1	wakes	1	the-child,	2	who	2	had	2	been	2	sleeping	2	in	2	peli's-arms,	1	chides	1	peli's-arms:	1	"do	1	you	1	have	1	any-idea	1

3575	but	1	in	2	reprogramming	1	ig-11,	1	kuiil	2	nurtures	1	the-mandalorian	2	and	1	helps	1	to	2	change;	1	feels	1	that	1	the-process	1	of	1	learning	1	how	1	function	1	again,	1	ig-11	1	gained	1	a-new-personality.	1
3576	some-writers	1	have	1	likewise	1	suggested	1	the-child	2	is	2	not	2	inherently	1	good	1	or	1	evil,	1	but	1	that	1	instead,	1	like	1	all-children,	1	impressionable	1	and	1	does	1	fully	1	understand	1	the-events	1	occurring	1	around	1	the-child.	1
3577	it	1	will	1	largely	1	fall	1	to	2	the-mandalorian	2	provide	1	this-guidance,	1	as	1	when	1	stops	1	him	1	from	1	strangling	1	cara-dune.	1
3578	however,	1	multiple-writers	1	have	1	questioned	1	whether	1	the	1	violent	2	acts	1	the-child	1	has	1	repeatedly	1	witnessed	1	throughout	1	the-mandalorian	1	are	1	having	1	a-negative-impact	1	on	1	his-development,	1	and	1	that	1	his	2	is	1	learning	1	to	1	become	1	as	1	a-result.	1
3579	during	1	a-scene	1	on	1	the-mandalorian's-spaceship,	1	the-child	1	observes	1	as	1	the-mandalorian	1	and	1	cara-dune	1	engage	1	in	1	a-friendly-arm-wrestling-match.	1

3685	at	1	the-cannes-film-festival	1	following	1	the-completion	1	of	1	thx	1	1138,	1	lucas	1	pushed	1	towards	1	buying	1	the-flash-gordon-rights,	1	but	1	the-flash-gordon-rights	1	were	1	already	1	tied-up	1	with	1	dino-de-laurentiis.	1
3686	lucas	1	later	1	recounted:	1	i	2	wanted	1	to	2	make	1	a-flash-gordon-movie,	1	with	1	all-the-trimmings,	1	but	1	couldn't	1	obtain	1	the-rights	1	the-characters.	1
3687	director-francis-ford-coppola,	1	who	1	accompanied	1	lucas	1	in	2	trying	1	to	1	buy	1	the-flash-gordon-rights,	1	recounted	1	1999:	1	"	1
3688	lucas	3	would	1	later	1	claim	1	that	2	had	1	the-idea	1	for	1	an-original-space-opera	1	long	1	before	2	1971,	1	and	1	even	1	tried	1	to	1	film	1	it	1	american-graffiti.	1
3689	believing	1	that	1	the-bleak-tone	1	of	1	thx	1	1138	1	led	2	to	3	its-poor-reception,	1	lucas	1	chose	1	make	1	star-wars	1	more	1	optimistic;	1	this	1	is	1	what	1	its-fun-and-adventurous-tone.	1
3690	lucas	1	went	1	to	1	united-artists	3	and	1	showed	1	the-script	1	for	1	american-graffiti,	1	but	1	passed	1	on	1	the-film,	1	which	1	was	1	then	1	picked	1	up	1	by	1	universal-pictures.	1
3691	united-artists	1	also	1	passed	1	on	1	lucas-space-opera-concept,	1	which	1	lucas	1	shelved	1	for	1	the	1	time	1	being.	1
3692	after	1	spending	1	the-next-two-years	1	completing	1	american-graffiti,	1	lucas	3	turned	1	attention	1	to	1	space	1	opera.	1
3693	lucas	1	drew	1	inspiration	1	from	1	politics	1	of	1	the-era,	1	later	1	saying,	1	“it	1	was	3	really	1	about	1	the-vietnam-war,	1	and	1	that	1	the-period	1	where	1	nixon	1	trying	1	to	1	run	1	for	1	a-[second]-term.	1
3694	"lucas	1	began	1	writing	1	in	1	january	1	1973,	1	"eight-hours	1	a	2	day,	1	five-days	1	week",	1	by	1	taking	1	small-notes,	1	inventing	1	odd-names	2	and	1	assigning	1	possible-characterizations.	1
3695	lucas	2	would	1	discard	1	many	1	of	1	these	1	by	1	the-time	1	the-final-script	3	was	1	written,	1	but	1	included	1	several-names	1	and	1	places	1	in	1	or	1	sequels.	1
3696	lucas	1	used	1	these-initial-names	1	and	1	ideas	1	to	1	compile	1	a-two-page-synopsis	1	titled	1	journal	1	of	3	the-whills,	1	which	1	told	1	the-tale	1	the-training	1	apprentice-cj-thorpe	1	as	1	a-"jedi-bendu"-space-commando	1	by	1	the-legendary-mace	1	windy.	1
3697	frustrated	1	that	1	lucas-story	1	was	1	too	1	difficult	1	to	1	understand,	1	lucas	1	then	1	began	1	writing	1	a-13-page-treatment	1	called	1	the	1	star	1	wars	1	on	1	april	1	17,	1	1973,	1	which	1	had	1	narrative-parallels	1	with	1	kurosawa's-1958-film	1	the-hidden-fortress.	1
3698	lucas	5	and	4	producer-gary-kurtz	3	presented	1	the-film-treatment	1	to	2	universal-pictures,	1	the-studio	1	that	2	financed	1	american-graffiti;	1	while	1	agreed	1	it	2	could	1	be	1	"a-very-commercial-venture",	1	had	1	doubts	1	about	1	ability	1	pull	1	all	1	off,"	1	said	1	should	1	follow	1	american-graffiti	1	with	1	more-consequential-themes.	1
3699	lucas	1	said,	1	"i've	1	always	1	been	1	an-outsider	1	to	1	hollywood-types.	1
3700	kurtz	1	said,	1	"although	1	star-wars	1	wasn't	1	like	1	[then-current-science-fiction]	1	at	1	all,	1	it	1	was	1	just	1	sort	1	of	2	lumped	1	into	1	that-same-kind	1	category.	1	"	1
3701	lucas	1	explained	1	in	1	1977	1	that	2	the-film	2	is	2	not	1	"about	1	the-future"	1	and	1	"is	1	a-fantasy	1	much	1	closer	1	to	2	the-brothers-grimm	1	than	1	it	1	2001."	1
3702	lucas	1	added:	1	"my-main-reason	1	for	1	making	1	it	1	was	1	to	1	give	1	young-people	1	an-honest,-wholesome-fantasy-life,	1	the-kind	1	my-generation	1	had.	1
3703	lucas	1	would	1	later	1	recontextualize	1	the-discussion	1	around	1	the-film,	1	saying	1	the-film	1	was	1	born	1	out	1	of	2	research	1	into	1	"psychological-underpinings	1	mythology",	1	a	1	claim	1	that	1	had	1	been	1	dismissed	1	by	1	kurtz	1	as	1	self-aggrandizing:	1	"	1
3704	the-whole-idea	1	of	3	star-wars	2	as	1	a-mythological-thing,	1	i	1	think	1	came	1	about	1	because	1	[later-lucas]-interviews	1	that	2	tied	1	the-film	1	to	1	the-hero	1	with	1	a-thousand-faces"	1	and	4	by	1	steven-hart	1	michael-kaminski:	1	"it	1	is	1	here	1	the-true-origin	1	comes	1	from	3	--	1	not	1	myth	1	legend,	1	but	1	the-'schlock'	1	sold	1	on	1	newspapers	1	stands	1	played	1	in	1	matinees.	1
3705	lucas	1	and	2	kurtz,	1	in	1	pitching	1	the-film,	1	said	1	that	1	it	1	would	1	be	2	"low-budget,	1	roger-corman-style,	1	the-budget	1	was	1	never	1	going	1	to	1	more	1	than—	1
3706	after	1	disney	1	rejected	1	the-project,	1	lucas	1	and	2	kurtz-kurtz	1	persisted	1	in	1	securing	1	a-studio	1	to	1	support	1	the-film	3	because	1	"other-people	1	had	1	read	1	said,	1	'yeah,	1	could	1	be	1	a-good-idea.'	1
3707	"	1	lucas	1	pursued	1	alan-ladd-jr.,	1	the-head	1	of	1	20th-century-fox,	1	and	2	in	1	june	1	1973	1	completed	1	a-deal	1	to	1	write	1	direct	1	the-film.	1
3708	although	1	ladd	2	did	1	not	1	grasp	1	the-technical-side	1	of	1	the-project,	1	believed	1	that	1	lucas	1	was	1	talented.	1
3709	lucas	1	later	1	stated	1	that	1	ladd	2	"invested	1	in	2	ladd,	1	did	1	not	1	invest	1	the-movie."	1
3710	a-deal	1	to	2	write	2	and	2	direct	2	the-film	1	gave	1	lucas	1	$150,000	1	the-film.	1
3711	american-graffiti's-positive-reception	1	afforded	1	lucas	2	the-leverage	1	necessary	1	to	2	renegotiate	1	deal	1	with	1	ladd	1	and	1	request	1	the-sequel-rights	1	the-film	1	in	1	august	1	1973.	1
3712	since	1	commencing	1	his-writing-process	1	in	2	january	1	1973,	1	lucas	1	had	1	done	1	"various-rewrites	1	the-evenings	1	after	1	the-day's-work."	1
3713	by	2	may	1	1974,	1	he	1	had	1	expanded	1	the-treatment	1	for	1	star-wars	1	into	1	a-rough-draft-screenplay,	1	adding	1	elements	1	such	1	as	1	the-sith,	1	the-death-star,	1	and	1	a-general	1	the-name	1	of	1	annikin-starkiller.	1
3714	lucas	1	envisioned	1	the-corellian-smuggler,	1	han-solo,	1	as	1	a-large,-green-skinned-monster	1	with	1	gills.	1
3715	lucas	5	based	1	chewbacca	1	on	1	alaskan	1	malamute	1	dog,	1	indiana	2	(whom	1	would	1	later	1	use	1	as	2	eponym	1	for	1	character	1	jones),	1	who	1	often	1	acted	1	the	1	director's	1	"co-pilot"	1	by	1	sitting	1	in	1	the-passenger-seat	1	of	1	car.	1
3716	lucas	1	completed	1	a-second-draft	1	in	1	january	1	1975	1	as	2	adventures	1	of	1	the-starkiller,	1	episode	1	one:	1	the-star-wars,	1	making	1	heavy-simplifications	1	and	1	introducing	1	the-young-hero	1	on	1	a-farm	1	luke-starkiller.	1
3717	for	1	example,	1	luke	2	had	1	several-brothers,	1	as	2	well	1	father,	1	who	1	appears	1	in	1	a-minor-role	1	at	1	the-end	1	of	1	the-film.	1
3718	this-draft	1	included	1	a-historical-jedi	1	who	1	was	1	the	1	first	1	to	3	ever	1	fall	1	the-dark-side,	1	and	1	then	1	trained	1	the-sith	1	use	1	the-sith.	1
3719	the-script	1	would	2	introduce	1	the-concept	1	of	1	a-jedi-master	2	and	1	son,	1	who	1	trains	1	to	1	be	1	a-jedi	1	under	1	jedi-father's-friend;	1	this	1	ultimately	1	form	1	the-basis	1	for	1	the-film	1	and,	1	later,	1	the-trilogy.	1
3720	han-solo	1	and	1	chewbacca's-identities	1	closely	1	resembled	1	those	1	seen	1	in	1	the-film.	1
3721	according	1	to	2	lucas,	1	this-draft	1	was	1	over	2	200	1	pages	1	long,	1	and	1	led	1	lucas	1	split	1	up	1	the-story	1	into	1	multiple-films	1	spanning	1	multiple-trilogies.	1
3722	lucas	1	began	1	to	1	rewrite	1	this-draft,	1	creating	1	a-synopsis	1	for	1	the-third-draft.	1
3723	during	1	work	1	on	1	this-rewrite,	1	lucas	1	began	1	researching	1	the-science-fiction-genre	1	by	1	watching	1	films	1	and	2	reading	1	books	1	(including	1	j.-r.-r.-tolkien's-the-hobbit)	1	comics.	1
3724	lucas	1	also	1	claims	1	to	1	have	1	read	1	scholastic-works	1	like	1	joseph-campbell's-the-hero	1	with	1	a-thousand-faces,	1	james-george-frazer's-the-golden-bough,	1	and	1	even-bruno-bettelheim's-the-uses	1	of	1	enchantment.	1
3725	these-claims	1	are	1	doubted	1	by	1	michael-kaminski	2	and	3	chris-taylor,	1	with	1	pointing	1	out	2	that	2	bettelheim's-book	1	would	1	not	1	come	1	until	1	after	1	star-wars	1	was	1	filmed	1	adding	1	"the-original-trilogy-campbell-connection	1	is	2	greatly	1	exaggerated	1	practically	1	non-existent",	1	noting	1	that,	1	in	1	fact,	1	this-draft	1	"even	1	closer	1	to	1	joseph-campbell's's-structure"	1	than	1	the-third.	1
3726	according	1	to	1	lucas,	1	lucas	1	wrote	1	a-rough-draft	1	of	1	about-250–300-pages	1	long,	1	which	1	contained	1	the-outline	1	for	1	the-entire-original-star-wars-trilogy.	1
3727	lucas	1	stated	1	that	3	the-story	1	evolved	1	over	1	time	1	and	1	"there	1	was	1	never	1	a-script	1	completed	1	had	1	the-entire-story	1	as	1	it	1	exists	1	now	1	[in	1	1983]	1	...	1
3728	i	3	kept	2	taking	1	out	1	all-the-good-parts,	1	and	1	just	1	telling	1	lucas	1	would	1	make	1	other-movies	1	someday."	1
3729	in	1	1975	1	lucas	2	suggested	1	could	1	make	1	a-trilogy,	1	which	1	"ends	1	with	1	the-destruction	1	of	2	the-empire"	1	and	1	a-possible-prequel	1	"about	1	the-backstory	1	kenobi	1	as	1	a-young-man."	1
3730	after	1	the-film's-smash-success,	1	lucasfilm	1	announced	1	that	1	lucas	1	had	1	already	1	written	1	"twelve-stories	1	in	1	the-adventures	1	of	1	luke-skywalker"	1	which,	1	according	1	to	2	kurtz,	1	were	1	set	1	be	1	"separate-adventures	1	rather	1	than	1	direct-sequels.	1
3731	during	1	the-writing	1	of	3	the-third-draft,	1	lucas	4	hired	1	conceptual-artist-ralph-mcquarrie	2	to	2	create	1	paintings	1	certain-scenes,	1	several	1	which	1	included	1	with	1	screenplay	1	when	1	delivered	1	20th-century-fox.	1
3732	on	1	february	1	27,	1	conceptual-artist-ralph-mcquarrie	1	granted	1	a-budget	1	of	1	$5	1	million;	1	this	1	was	1	later	1	increased	1	to	1	$8.25	1	million.	1
3733	subsequently,	1	lucas	1	started	1	writing	1	with	1	a-budget	1	in	1	mind,	1	conceiving	1	the	1	cheap,	1	"used"	1	look	1	of	3	much	1	the-film,	1	and	1	(with	1	fox	1	having	1	just	1	shut	1	down	1	the-film	1	special	1	effects	1	department)	1	reducing	1	the-number	1	complex-special-effects-shots	1	called	1	for	1	by	1	the-script.	1
3734	the-third-draft,	1	dated	1	august	1	1,	1	1975	1	characterized	1	luke	3	as	1	an-only-child,	1	with	2	father	1	already	1	dead,	1	replacing	1	a-substitute	1	named	1	ben	1	kenobi.	1
3735	this-script	1	would	1	be	1	re-written	1	for	1	the-fourth-and-final-draft,	1	dated	1	january	1	1,	1	1976,	1	as	2	the-adventures	1	of	2	luke-starkiller-luke-starkiller	1	taken	1	from	1	the-journal	1	the-whills,	1	saga	1	i:	1
3736	lucas	2	worked	1	with	1	friends	1	gloria-katz	1	and	1	willard-huyck	1	to	1	revise	1	the-fourth-draft	1	into	1	the-final-pre-production-script.	1
3737	lucas	1	finished	1	writing	1	the-final-pre-production-script	1	in	1	march	1	1976,	1	when	1	the-crew	1	started	1	filming.	1
3738	lucas	1	said,	1	"what	1	finally	1	emerged	1	through	1	the-many-drafts	1	of	1	the-final-pre-production-script	1	has	1	obviously	1	been	1	influenced	1	by	1	science-fiction	1	and	1	action-adventure	1
3739	during	1	production,	1	he	1	changed	1	luke's-name	1	from	1	starkiller	1	to	2	skywalker	1	and	2	altered	1	the-title	1	the-star-wars	1	later-star-wars.	1
3740	he	2	would	1	also	1	continue	1	to	1	tweak	1	the-script	1	during	1	filming,	1	including	1	adding	1	the-death	1	of	2	obi-wan	1	after	1	realizing	1	served	1	no-purpose	1	in	1	the-ending	1	the-film.	1
3741	for	1	the-film's-opening-crawl,	1	lucas	1	originally	1	wrote	1	a-composition	1	consisting	1	of	1	six-paragraphs	1	with	1	four-sentences	1	each.	1
3742	lucas	1	said,	1	"the-crawl	1	is	1	such-a-hard-thing	1	because	1	you	1	have	1	to	1	be	1	careful	1	that	2	you're	1	not	1	using	1	too-many-words	1	people	1	don't	1	understand.	1
3743	lucas	3	showed	1	draft	1	to	1	friends.	1
3744	lucas	1	recounted	1	what	1	de-palma	2	said	1	the	1	first	1	time	1	saw	1	it:	1	"george,	1	you're	1	out	1	of	1	your-mind!	1
3745	george-lucas	1	recruited	1	many-conceptual-designers,	1	including	1	colin-cantwell,	1	who	1	worked	1	on	1	2001:	1	a-space-odyssey	1	(1968),	1	to	3	conceptualize	1	the-initial-spacecraft-models;	1	alex	1	tavoularis	1	create	1	the-preliminary-conceptual-storyboard-sketches	1	of	1	early-scripts;	1	and	2	ralph	1	mcquarrie	1	visualize	1	the-characters,	1	costumes,	1	props	1	scenery.	1
3746	after	1	mcquarrie's-drawings	1	for	3	lucas's-colleagues	1	hal-barwood	1	and	1	matthew-robbins	1	(who	1	were	1	collaborating	1	a-film)	1	caught	1	century-fox-interest,	1	lucas	1	met	1	with	1	mcquarrie	1	to	1	discuss	1	century-fox-plans	1
3747	two	1	years	1	later,	1	after	1	completing	1	american-graffiti,	1	lucas	1	approached	1	mcquarrie	1	and	1	asked	1	century-fox	2	if	1	would	1	be	1	interested	1	"in	1	doing	1	something	1	for	1	star-wars."	1
3748	the-film	1	was	1	ambitious	1	as	1	lucas	1	wanted	1	to	1	create	1	fresh-prop-prototypes	1	and	1	sets	1	(based	1	on	1	mcquarrie's-paintings)	1	that	1	had	1	never	1	been	1	realized	1	before	1	in	1	science-fiction-films.	1
3749	lucas	2	commissioned	1	production-designers	1	john-barry	1	and	1	roger-christian,	1	who	1	were	1	working	1	on	2	the-sets	1	of	1	the-film	1	lucky-lady	1	(1975)	1	when	1	first	1	approached	1	them,	1	to	1	work	1	the-production-sets.	1
3750	"	1	they	2	had	1	a-conversation	1	with	2	lucas	1	on	1	what	1	he	1	would	1	like	1	the-film	1	to	1	appear	1	like,	1	creating	1	the-desired-sets.	1
3751	christian	2	said	1	that	1	lucas	1	"didn't	1	want	1	anything	1	[in	1	star-wars]	1	to	1	stand	1	out,	1	wanted	1	it	1	[to	1	look]	1	all	1	real	1	and	1	used.	1
3752	lucas	1	described	1	a-"used-future"-concept	1	to	3	the-production-designers	1	in	1	which	1	all-devices,	1	ships,	1	and	2	buildings	1	do	1	with	1	tatooine	1	or	1	the-rebels	1	looked	1	aged	1	dirty,	1	as	1	opposed	1	the-sleeker-designs	1	of	1	the-empire.	1
3753	lucas	1	also	1	wanted	1	the-spaceships	1	to	2	look	1	"cobbled	1	together,	1	as	1	opposed	1	a-sleek-monoshape."	1
3754	lucas	1	believed	1	that	2	"what	1	is	2	required	1	for	1	true-credibility	1	a-used-future",	1	opposing	1	the-interpretation	1	of	1	"future	1	in	1	most-futurist-movies"	1	"always	1	looks	1	new	1	and	2	clean	1	shiny."	1
3755	the-designers	1	started	1	working	1	with	1	the-director	1	before	1	star-wars	1	was	1	approved	1	by	1	20th-century-fox.	1
3756	although	1	lucas	2	initially	1	provided	1	funds	1	using	1	earnings	1	from	1	american-graffiti,	1	it	1	was	1	inadequate.	1
3757	christian	2	suggested	1	that	1	lucas	1	use	1	scrap	1	in	1	making	1	the-dressings,	1	and	1	agreed.	1
3758	in	1	1975,	1	lucas	1	formed	1	ilm	1	after	1	discovering	1	that	1	20th-century-fox's-visual-effects-department	1	had	1	been	1	disbanded.	1
3759	ilm	2	began	1	work	1	on	1	star-wars	1	in	2	a-warehouse	1	van-nuys.	1
3760	george-lucas	2	tried	1	"to	1	get	1	a-cohesive-reality"	1	for	1	feature.	1
3761	however,	1	since	1	the-film	2	is	1	a-fairy-tale,	1	as	1	george-lucas	1	had	1	described,	1	"i	1	still	1	wanted	1	to	1	have	2	an-ethereal-quality,	1	yet	1	be	1	well	1	composed	1	and,	1	also,	1	an-alien-look."	1
3762	george-lucas	1	designed	1	the-film	1	to	1	have	1	an	1	"extremely	1	bizarre,	1	gregg	1	toland-like	1	surreal	1	look	1	with	1	strange-over-exposed-colors,	1	a-lot	2	of	2	shadows,	1	hot-areas.	1	"	1
3763	george-lucas	1	wanted	1	star-wars	1	to	2	embrace	1	the-combination	1	of	3	"strange-graphics	1	fantasy"	1	and	1	"the-feel	1	a-documentary"	1	impress	1	a-distinct-look.	1
3764	unsworth	2	was	2	interested	1	in	1	working	1	with	1	the-director,	1	and	2	initially	1	accepted	1	the-job	2	when	1	offered	1	to	1	by	1	lucas	1	kurtz.	1
3765	lucas	2	called	1	up	1	for	2	other-cinematographers,	1	and	2	eventually	1	chose	1	taylor,	1	basing	1	choice	1	on	1	taylor's	1	cinematography	1	dr.-strangelove	1	a-hard-day's-night	1	(both	1	1964).	1
3766	on	1	lucas-decision,	1	lucas	1	said:	1	"i	1	thought	1	they	1	were	1	good,	1	eccentrically	1	photographed	1	pictures	1	with	1	a-strong-documentary-flavor.	1	"	1
3767	taylor	1	said	1	that	1	lucas,	1	who	1	was	1	consumed	1	by	1	the-details	1	of	1	the-complicated-production,	1	"avoided	1	all-meetings	1	and	2	contact	1	with	1	lucas	1	from	1	day	1	one,	1	so	1	i	2	read	1	the-extra-long-script	1	many	1	times	1	made	1	my-own-decisions	1	as	1	to	1	how	1	would	1	shoot	1	the-picture."	1
3768	taylor	1	also	1	said,	1	"i	1	took	1	it	1	upon	1	lucas	1	to	2	experiment	1	with	1	photographing	1	the-lightsabers	1	and	1	other-things	1	onstage	1	before	1	we	2	moved	1	on	1	two-weeks	1	of	1	location-work	1	in	1	tunisia.	1	"	1
3769	during	1	production,	1	lucas	1	and	2	taylor—whom	1	kurtz	1	called	1	"old-school"	1	"crotchety"—had	1	disputes	1	over	1	filming.	1
3770	with	1	a-background	1	in	1	independent-filmmaking,	1	lucas	1	was	1	accustomed	1	to	1	creating	1	most	1	of	2	the-elements	1	the-film	1	himself.	1
3771	lucas-lighting-suggestions	1	were	1	rejected	1	by	2	taylor,	1	who	1	believed	1	that	1	lucas	2	was	1	overstepping	1	boundaries	1	giving	1	specific-instructions,	1	sometimes	1	even	1	moving	1	lights	1	and	1	cameras	1	himself.	1
3772	lucas	1	would]	1	say,	1	'turn	1	off	2	this-light,	1	and	1	turn	1	this-light.'	1
3773	originally,	1	lucas	1	envisioned	1	the-planet	1	of	2	tatooine,	1	where	1	much	1	the-film	1	would	1	take	1	place,	1	as	1	a-jungle-planet.	1
3774	gary-kurtz	3	traveled	1	to	1	the-philippines	1	to-scout-locations;	1	however,	1	because	1	of	2	the-idea	1	spending-months	1	filming	1	in	1	the-jungle	1	would	1	make	1	lucas	1	"itchy",	1	refined	1	vision	1	and	1	made	1	tatooine	1	a	1	desert	1	planet	1	instead.	1
3775	lucas	2	later	1	stated	1	that	1	had	1	wanted	1	to	1	make	1	it	1	look	1	like	1	outer-space.	1
3776	when	1	principal-photography	1	began	1	on	2	march	1	22,	1	1976,	1	in	1	the-tunisian-desert	1	for	1	the-scenes	1	tatooine,	1	the-project	1	faced	1	several-problems.	1
3777	lucas	1	fell	1	behind	1	schedule	1	in	1	the-first-week	1	of	1	shooting	1	due	1	to	1	malfunctioning-props	1	and	1	electronic-breakdowns.	1
3778	given	1	this-situation,	1	lucas	1	requested	1	heavy-filtration,	1	which	1	taylor	1	rejected,	1	who	1	said:	1	"i	1	thought	1	the-look	1	of	1	the-film	1	should	1	be	1	absolutely	1	clean	1	...	1
3779	other-locations	2	included	1	the-sand-dunes	1	of	2	the-desert	1	near	1	nafta,	1	where	1	a	1	scene	1	featuring	1	a-giant-skeleton	1	a-creature	1	lying	1	in	1	the-background	1	as	1	r2-d2	1	and	1	c-3po	1	make	1	way	1	across	1	the-sands	1	was	1	filmed.	1
3780	after	1	several-scenes	1	were	1	filmed	1	against	1	the-volcanic-canyons	1	outside	1	tozeur,	1	production	1	moved	1	to	2	matmata	1	film	1	luke's-home	1	on	1	tatooine.	1
3781	lucas	1	chose	1	hotel-sidi-driss,	1	which	1	is	1	larger	1	than	1	the-typical-underground-dwellings,	1	to	1	shoot	1	the-interior	1	of	1	luke's-homestead.	1
3782	after	1	two-and-a-half-weeks	1	of	1	filming	1	in	1	tunisia,	1	production	1	moved	1	to	2	elstree-studios,	1	near	1	london,	1	film	1	interior-scenes.	1
3783	star-wars	1	required	1	the-use	1	of	1	nine-different-sound-stages	1	simultaneously,	1	which	1	most-studios	1	couldn't	1	accommodate.	1
3784	because	1	of	2	stricter-working-conditions,	1	filming	1	in	2	britain	1	had	1	to	1	finish	1	by	1	5:30-pm,	1	unless	1	lucas	1	was	1	the-middle	1	a-scene.	1
3785	actor-baker	2	later	1	confessed	1	that	1	thought	1	the-film	1	would	1	be	1	a-failure.	1
3786	harrison-ford	1	found	1	the-film	1	strange	1	that	1	"there's	1	a-princess	2	with	1	weird-buns	1	in	2	hair",	1	and	1	called	1	chewbacca	1	a	1	"giant	1	a-monkey-suit.	1
3787	lucas	1	commissioned	1	computer-programmer-larry-cuba	1	to	1	create	1	the-animated-death-star-plans	1	shown	1	at	1	the-rebel-base	1	on	1	yavin	1	4.	1
3788	lucas	1	selected	1	the-location	1	as	1	a-potential-filming-site	1	after	1	seeing	1	a-poster	1	of	1	it	1	hanging	1	at	1	a-travel-agency	1	while	1	he	1	was	1	filming	1	in	1	britain.	1
3789	this	1	inspired	1	he	1	to	3	send	1	a-film-crew	1	guatemala	1	in	1	march	1	1977	1	shoot	1	scenes.	1
3790	while	2	shooting,	1	lucas	2	rarely	1	spoke	1	to	1	the-actors,	1	who	1	believed	1	that	1	expected	1	too	1	much	1	of	1	a-film-crew	1	providing	1	little-direction.	1
3791	kurtz	1	has	1	said	1	that	1	lucas	1	"wasn't	1	gregarious,	1	kurtz's	1	very	2	much	1	a	1	loner	1	and	1	shy,	1	so	1
3792	ladd	1	offered	1	lucas	1	some	1	of	1	the-only-support	1	from	2	the-studio;	1	kurtz	1	dealt	1	with	1	scrutiny	1	board-members	1	over	1	the-rising-budget	1	and	1	complex-screenplay-drafts.	1
3793	at	1	the-same-time,	1	after	1	production	2	fell	1	behind	1	schedule,	1	ladd	1	told	1	lucas-lucas	1	had	1	to	1	finish	1	within	1	a-week	1
3794	kurtz	1	said	1	that	1	"it	1	came	1	out	1	to	1	be	1	like	2	9.8	1	or	2	.9	1	something	1	that,	1	and	1	in	1	the-end	1	they	1	just	1	said,	1	'yes,	1	that's	1	okay	1
3795	during	1	production,	1	the-cast	1	attempted	1	to	1	make	1	lucas	2	laugh	1	or	1	smile,	1	as	1	often	1	appeared	1	depressed.	1
3796	at	1	one-point,	1	the-project	1	became	1	so	1	demanding	1	that	1	lucas	2	was	2	diagnosed	1	with	1	hypertension	1	and	2	exhaustion	1	warned	1	to	1	reduce	1	stress	1	level.	1
3797	star-wars	2	was	1	originally	1	slated	1	for	1	release	1	on	1	christmas	1	1976;	1	however,	1	production	1	delays	1	pushed	1	the-film's-release	1	to	1	mid-1977.	1
3798	editor-john-jympson	2	began	1	cutting	1	the-film	1	together	1	while	1	lucas	3	was	2	still	1	filming	1	in	2	tunisia;	1	as	1	noted,	1	an-"impossible-position"	1	because	1	had	1	not	1	explained	1	any	1	of	1	the-film's	1	material	1	to	1	editor-john-jympson.	1
3799	when	1	lucas	3	watched	1	jympson's-rough-cut	1	for	1	the-first-time,	1	disliked	1	what	1	saw.	1
3800	lucas	1	was	1	prepared	1	to	1	give	1	jympson	2	more-time;	1	disliked	1	lucas'	1	working	1	style.	1
3801	as	1	production	1	went	1	on,	1	lucas	2	still	1	disapproved	1	of	1	jympson's	1	cut	1	and	1	fired	1	halfway	1	through	1	the-film's-production.	1
3802	lucas	1	commented:	1	"unfortunately	1	it	1	didn't	1	work	1	out.	1
3803	after	1	attempting	1	to	2	persuade	1	jympson	1	cut	1	the-film	2	his-way,	1	lucas	1	replaced	1	his	1	with	2	paul-hirsch,	1	richard-chew	2	and	1	then-wife,	1	marcia	1	lucas,	1	who	1	was	1	also	1	cutting	1	new-york,	1	new-york	1	(1977)	1	lucas's	1	friend	1	martin-scorsese.	1
3804	richard-chew	1	considered	1	the-film	1	to	1	have	1	been	1	cut	1	in	2	a	1	slow,	1	by-the-book	1	manner:	1	scenes	1	were	1	played	1	out	1	master-shots	1	that	1	flowed	1	into	1	close-up-coverage.	1
3805	the-most-significant-material-cut	1	was	1	a-series	1	of	2	scenes	1	from	1	the-first-part	1	the-film	1	which	1	introduced	1	luke-skywalker.	1
3806	these-early-scenes,	1	set	1	in	1	anchorhead	1	on	1	the-planet-tatooine,	1	presented	1	the-audience	1	with	1	luke's-everyday-life	1	among	1	luke-friends	1	as	1	it	1	is	1	affected	1	by	1	the-space-battle	1	above	1	the-planet;	1	they	1	also	1	introduced	1	the-character	1	of	1	biggs-darklighter,	1	luke's-closest-friend	1	who	1	departs	1	to	1	join	1	the-rebellion.	1
3807	so	1	we	1	simplified	1	it	1	by	1	taking	1	out	1	luke	1	and	1	biggs.	1
3808	"	1	lucas	1	was	1	looking	1	for	1	a-way	1	of	2	accelerating	1	the-storytelling,	1	and	2	removing	1	luke's-early-scenes	1	would	1	distinguish	1	star-wars	1	from	1	luke	1	earlier-teenage-drama	1	"get	1	that	1	american-graffiti	1	feel	1	out	1	american-graffiti.	1
3809	lucas	2	also	1	stated	1	that	1	wanted	1	to	3	move	1	the-narrative-focus	1	c-3po	1	and	1	r2-d2:	1	"at	1	the-time,	1	have	1	the-first-half-hour	1	of	1	the-film	1	be	1	mainly	1	about	1	robots	1	was	1	a-bold-idea.	1	"	1
3810	industrial-light	2	&	2	magic	2	had	1	spent	1	half	1	of	1	budget	1	on	1	four-shots	1	that	1	lucas	1	deemed	1	unacceptable.	1
3811	lucas	1	inspired	1	ilm	1	by	1	editing	1	together	1	aerial-dogfights	1	from	1	old-war-films,	1	which	1	enhanced	1	the-pacing	1	of	1	the-scenes.	1
3812	sound-designer-ben-burtt	1	had	1	created	1	a-library	1	of	1	sounds	1	that	1	lucas	1	referred	1	to	1	as	1	an-"organic-soundtrack."	1
3813	lucas	2	and	2	burtt	2	created	1	the-robotic-voice	1	of	1	r2-d2	1	by	1	filtering	1	voices	1	through	1	an-electronic-synthesizer.	1
3814	darth-vader's-breathing	1	was	2	achieved	1	by	1	burtt	1	breathing	1	through	1	the-mask	1	of	2	a-scuba-regulator	1	implanted	1	with	1	a-microphone,	1	which	2	began	1	the-idea	1	darth-vader	1	having	1	been	1	a-burn-victim,	1	not	1	the-case	1	during	1	production.	1
3815	in	1	february	1	1977,	1	lucas	1	screened	1	an-early-cut	1	of	2	the-film	1	for	1	fox-executives,	1	several-director-friends,	1	along	1	with	1	roy-thomas	1	and	1	howard-chaykin	1	marvel-comics	1	who	1	were	1	preparing	1	a-star-wars-comic-book.	1
3816	lucas	1	later	1	said	1	that	1	the-group	1	was	1	honest	1	and	1	seemed	1	bemused	1	by	1	the-millennium-falcon.	1
3817	lucas	1	found	1	the-experience	1	shocking	1	and	1	rewarding,	1	having	1	never	1	gained	1	any-approval	1	from	1	studio-executives	1	before.	1
3818	with	1	the-project	1	$2	1	million	1	over	1	budget,	1	lucas	1	was	1	forced	1	to	2	make	1	numerous-artistic-compromises	1	complete	1	star-wars.	1
3819	lucas	1	had	1	to	2	write	1	around	1	a-scene	1	featuring	1	a-human-jabba	1	the-hutt,	1	which	1	was	1	scrapped	1	due	1	not	1	being	1	in	1	focus.	1
3820	lucas	3	would	1	later	1	claim	1	wanted	1	to	1	superimpose	1	a-stop-motion-creature	1	over	1	the-actor	1	-	1	which	1	did	1	in	1	the-1997-special-edition	1	with	1	a-computer-generated-version	1	of	1	jabba.	1
3821	however,	1	all-the-script-drafts	1	(with	1	the-exception	1	of	2	one	1	that	1	lucas	2	doctored	1	after	1	the-fact)	1	describe	1	jabba	1	as	1	humanoid,	1	the-notion	1	being	1	an-alien	1	not	1	having	1	come	1	up	1	until	2	work	1	on	1	the-1979-re-release,	1	and	1	scrapped	1	the-special-edition.	1
3822	on	1	the-recommendation	1	of	1	williams-friend-steven-spielberg,	1	george-lucas	1	hired	1	composer-john-williams.	1
3823	george-lucas	1	originally	1	hired	1	williams	3	to	3	consult	1	on	1	music-editing-choices	1	and	1	compose	1	the-source-music	1	for	1	the-music,	1	telling	1	that	1	intends	1	use	1	extant-music.	1
3824	george-lucas	2	believed	1	that	2	the-film	1	would	2	portray	1	visually-foreign-worlds,	1	but	1	the-musical-score	1	give	1	the-audience	1	an-emotional-familiarity;	1	wanted	1	a-grand-musical-sound	1	for	1	star-wars.	1
3825	therefore,	1	george-lucas	4	assembled	1	favorite	1	orchestral	1	pieces	1	for	1	the-soundtrack,	1	until	1	williams	1	convinced	1	that	1	an-original-score	1	would	1	be	1	unique	1	and	1	more	1	unified,	1	having	1	viewed	1	music	1	choices	1	as	1	a-temp-track.	1
3826	lucas	1	would	1	later	1	deny	1	having	1	ever	1	conceived	1	using	1	extant-music	1	for	1	the-film.	1
3827	in	2	march	1	1977,	1	williams'	1	conducted	1	the-london-symphony-orchestra	1	to	1	record	1	the-star-wars-soundtrack	1	12-days.	1
3828	20th-century-records	2	also	1	released	1	the-story	1	of	3	star-wars	1	that	1	same	1	year,	1	a-narrated-audio-drama-adaptation	1	the-film	1	utilizing	1	some	1	original-music,	1	dialogue,	1	and	1	sound-effects.	1
3829	george-lucas	2	had	1	originally	1	intended	1	to	3	remake	1	the-1930s-flash-gordon-film-serials,	1	but	1	was	1	unable	1	obtain	1	the-rights;	1	thus,	1	resorted	1	drawing	1	from	1	akira-kurosawa's-1958-film	1	the-hidden-fortress	1	and,	1	allegedly,	1	joseph-campbell's-the-hero	1	with	1	a-thousand-faces.	1
3830	star-wars	1	features	1	many-elements	1	derived	1	from	1	flash-gordon,	1	such	1	as	1	the-conflict	1	between	2	rebels	1	and	3	imperial-forces,	1	the-wipes	1	scenes,	1	the-fusion	1	of	1	futuristic-technology	1	traditional-mythology,	1	the-famous-opening-crawl	1	that	1	begins	1	each-film.	1
3831	the-influence	1	of	1	the-hidden-fortress	1	can	1	be	1	seen	2	in	2	the-relationship	1	between	1	c-3po	1	and	3	r2-d2,	1	which	1	evolved	1	from	1	the-two-bickering-peasants,	1	tahei	1	matashichi,	1	a-japanese-family-crest	1	each-film	1	is	1	similar	1	to	1	the-imperial-crest.	1
3832	star-wars	1	also	1	borrows	1	heavily	1	from	1	another-kurosawa-film,	1	yojimbo	1	(1961).	1

3835	frank-herbert	1	reported	1	that	2	"david-lynch,	1	[director	1	of	2	the-1984-film-dune]	1	had	1	trouble	1	with	1	the-fact	1	star-wars	1	used	1	up	1	so	1	much	1	dune.	1	"	1
3836	the-death-star-assault-scene	1	was	1	modeled	1	after	1	the-world-war-ii-film	1	the-dam-busters	1	(1955),	1	in	2	which	1	royal-air-force-lancaster-bombers	1	fly	1	along	1	heavily-defended-reservoirs	1	and	1	aim	1	bouncing	1	bombs	1	at	1	dams,	1	order	1	to	1	cripple	1	the-heavy-industry	1	of	1	germany's-ruhr-region.	1
3837	in	2	addition,	1	the-sequence	1	was	1	partially	1	inspired	1	by	3	the-climax	1	of	1	the-film	1	633	1	squadron	1	(1964),	1	directed	1	walter-grauman,	1	which	1	raf-de-havilland-mosquitos	1	attack	1	a-german-heavy-water-plant	1	flying	1	down	1	a-narrow-fjord	1	to	1	drop	1	special-bombs	1	at	1	a-precise-point,	1	while	1	avoiding	1	anti-aircraft-guns	1	and	1	german-fighters.	1

3839	the-death-star	1	has	1	a-docking-bay	1	reminiscent	1	of	1	the-one	1	on	1	the-orbiting-space-station	1	in	1	2001.	1

4285	luke	1	eventually	1	agrees	1	to	1	teach	1	rey	1	the-ways	1	of	1	the-force.	1
4286	rey	1	demonstrates	1	immense-raw-strength	1	and	2	a-clear-temptation	1	toward	1	the-dark-side	1	of	2	the-force	1	that	1	reminds	1	luke	1	kylo-ren,	1	who	1	was	1	once	1	his-nephew	1	student,	1	ben-solo.	1
4287	all	1	the	1	while,	1	rey	1	feels	1	a-sudden-connection	1	through	1	the-force	1	with	1	ren,	1	who	1	tells	2	her	2	that	2	luke	6	tried	1	to	2	kill	2	while	1	was	2	the-jedi-master’s-student	1	(	1	later	1	tempted	1	ben	1	after	1	seeing	1	a-vision	1	of	1	the-pain	1	and	1	suffering	1	would	1	cause,	1	but	1	relented).	1

4290	so,	1	rey,	1	chewbacca,	1	and	2	r2-d2	1	leave	1	without	1	him,	1	rey	1	goes	1	to	1	meet	1	ren	1	in	1	the-supremacy.	1
4291	ren	2	takes	1	rey-prisoner	1	and	1	brings	1	before	1	snoke.	1
4292	snoke	2	tells	1	ren	3	that	1	created	1	the-force-connection	1	between	1	and	1	as	1	a-trap	1	to	1	reach	1	luke.	1
4293	snoke-tortures	1	and	2	taunts	1	rey,	1	showing	1	ren	2	the-attack	1	on	1	the-resistance	1	transports,	1	eventually	1	orders	1	to	1	kill	1	ren.	1

4650	after	1	a-brief-confrontation	1	between	1	the-group	1	and	1	luke,	1	their-leader,	1	ren,	1	stops	1	the-proceedings	1	by	1	activating	1	a-kill-switch	1	on	1	ren	1	lightsaber.	1

4654	after	1	they	1	are	1	unable	1	to	3	sense	1	luke's-presence,	1	ben	3	elaborates	1	on	1	the-confrontation,	1	believing	1	have	1	killed	1	luke,	1	and	1	states	1	that	1	intends	1	leave	1	the-planet.	1
4655	believing	1	ben	3	to	2	be	2	responsible	1	for	1	the-temple's-destruction,	1	voe	1	attacks	1	only	1	easily	1	subdued	1	with	2	hennix	1	and	2	tai,	1	leaves	1	the-planet	1	on	1	a-nearby-shuttle,	1	the-trio	1	in	1	close-pursuit.	1

4661	however,	1	hennix,	1	believing	1	ben	2	to	1	have	1	killed	1	tai,	1	throws	1	lightsaber	1	in	2	a-lethal-spin	1	at	1	ben;	1	deflecting	1	it,	1	hennix	1	is	1	bisected.	1

4664	after	1	telling	1	him	3	of	1	the-encounter	1	with	1	hennix,	1	ren	1	states	1	that	1	ben	1	was	1	not	1	responsible	1	for	3	it,	1	and	1	therefore	1	ineligible	1	membership,	1	although	1	offers	1	another-chance	1	due	1	to	1	snoke	1	having	1	vouched	1	him.	1

4805	during	1	this-time,	1	anakin-skywalker	3	is	1	a-full-fledged-jedi-knight	1	and	1	the-series	1	shows	1	how	1	progresses	1	into	1	fall	1	to	1	the-dark-side	1	of	1	the-force.	1
4806	the-series	1	also	1	explores	1	dooku's-attempts	1	at	1	training	1	secret-apprentices	1	like	1	asajj-ventress	1	and	2	savage-opress	1	in	1	order	1	to	1	eventually	1	defeat	1	darth-sidious	1	become	1	the-ruling-sith-lord.	1
4807	the-origin,	2	agenda,	2	abilities	2	and	2	philosophy	2	of	2	the-sith	2	are	1	intertwined	1	with	1	relationship	1	to	1	the-force.	1
4808	with	1	proper-training,	1	the-force	1	may	1	be	1	called	1	upon	1	by	1	rare-individuals	1	capable	1	of	1	"sensing"	1	or	1	"touching"	1	it	1	to	1	achieve	1	extraordinary-feats	1	such	1	as	1	telekinesis,	1	precognition	1	and	1	mental-suggestion.	1
4809	the-sith	1	originated	1	in	1	a-species	1	of	3	force-sensitive-warriors	1	who	1	discovered	1	the-efficacy	1	passion	1	as	1	a-tool	1	to	2	draw	1	on	1	the-force	1	at	1	least	1	5,000	1	years	1	prior	1	the-events	1	the-first-star-wars-film.	1
4810	the-jedi	1	served	1	as	1	a-space-faring-knightly-order	1	within	1	the-galactic-republic,	1	a-representative-democracy	1	encompassing	1	most-developed-worlds.	1
4811	the-jedi	2	sought	1	to	3	use	1	the-powers	1	of	3	the-force	1	help	1	defend	1	the	1	weak	1	and	2	advance	1	the-rule	1	law	1	across	1	the-galaxy,	1	in	1	keeping	1	with	1	ethics	1	self-sacrifice	1	service	1	the-common-welfare.	1
4812	the-jedi	3	mirrored	1	method	1	of	3	utilizing	1	the-force,	1	and	2	doctrine	1	favored	1	states	1	serenity,	1	detachment,	1	compassion,	1	humility	1	as	1	the-proper-means	1	accessing	1	its-power.	1
4813	eventually,	1	controversy	1	led	1	to	1	a-sectarian-conflict	1	in	1	which	1	the-jedi	1	were	1	defeated	1	and	1	exiled.	1
4814	in	1	exile,	1	the-jedi	2	were	1	free	1	to	1	explore	1	the-relationship	1	between	1	passion	1	and	1	the-force.	1
4815	the-jedi	2	concluded	1	that	1	the-martial-and-ethical-disciplines	1	of	3	the-jedi-establishment	1	were	1	foolish	1	and	2	misguided:	1	passion,	1	not-quietude,	1	was	2	the-most-potent-means	1	accessing	1	the-force,	1	conflict,	1	not	1	peace,	1	the-natural-and-healthy-state	1	the-universe.	1
4816	in	1	their-training,	1	the-dissidents	1	would	1	seek	1	to	2	master	1	the-force	1	by	2	cultivating	1	dark-passions	1	such	1	as	2	anger	1	and	1	hate,	1	a-practice	1	anathematized	1	the-jedi	1	taking	1	recourse	1	the-force's	1	"dark	1	side."	1
4817	guided	1	by	1	their-kratocratic-and-egoistic-philosophy	1	and	2	armed	1	with	1	taboo-dark-side-techniques,	1	the-exiles	1	would	1	reemerge	1	to	2	menace	1	the-galaxy	1	as	1	the-sith-order,	1	aiming	1	conquer	1	the-galactic-republic	1	exact	1	revenge	1	against	1	the-jedi.	1
4818	ultimately,	1	the-paradox	1	of	2	reconciling	1	endless-personal-ambition	1	with	1	corporate-action	1	would	1	be	1	“resolved”	1	through	1	a-drastic-reorganization	1	effected	1	by	1	a-leader	1	named	1	darth	1	bane,	1	who	1	recast	1	the-sith	1	in	1	an-esoteric-lineal-master-apprentice-tradition	1	known	1	as	1	“the-rule	1	two.”	1
4819	in	1	this-way,	1	darth-bane	2	guaranteed	1	the-conspiracy	1	remained	1	a-secret	1	for	1	a-thousand-years;	1	believed	1	that	1	the-kratocratic-essence	1	of	2	sith-philosophy	1	could	1	be	1	reconciled	1	with	1	a-sustained-project	1	galactic-domination	1	and	1	revenge	1	against	1	the-jedi.	1
4820	ascent	1	to	1	power	1	of	1	the-sith	1	====	1
4821	darth-bane's-plan	1	would	1	come	1	to	1	fruition	1	through	1	sheev-palpatine,	1	a-naboo-senator,	1	later-supreme-chancellor,	1	of	2	the-galactic-republic,	1	and	1	secretly-a-dark-lord	1	the-sith	1	(“darth-sidious”).	1
4822	by	1	manipulating	1	disgruntled-factions	1	within	1	the-galactic-republic,	1	palpatine	1	orchestrated	1	civil-war.	1
4823	although	1	the-jedi	2	eventually	1	discovered	1	palpatine's-identity	1	as	2	a-sith	1	and	1	attempted	1	to	1	arrest	1	him,	1	this-action	1	was	1	anticipated	1	by	2	palpatine,	1	who	1	framed	1	their-actions	1	an-attempted-coup,	1	providing	1	in	1	turn	1	a-pretext	1	for	1	annihilating	1	activating	1	“order	1	66,”	1	one	1	of	1	the-clone-soldiers’-embedded-protocols.	1
4824	in	3	the-course	1	of	3	effecting	1	his-designs,	1	palpatine	2	also	1	manipulated	1	the-jedi's-most-powerful-initiate,	1	anakin-skywalker,	1	into	1	service,	1	by	1	promising	1	to	2	teach	1	skywalker	3	dark-side-techniques	1	that	1	could	1	save	1	the-life	1	padmé-amidala,	1	a-galactic-senator	1	whom	1	was	1	secretly	1	married	1	violation	1	jedi-rules,	1	and	1	whose-death	1	childbirth	1	had	1	preternaturally	1	foreseen.	1
4825	in	2	a-tragic-irony,	1	amidala's-sheer-horror	1	at	1	discovering	1	skywalker's-collaboration	1	with	1	sidious	2	destroying	1	the-jedi	2	would	2	itself	1	be	1	the-cause	1	of	4	death	1	during	1	childbirth,	1	though	1	trick	1	skywalker	1	into	1	believing	1	that	1	an-episode	1	skywalker's	1	physical	1	abuse	1	amidala	1	had	1	been	1	the-actual-cause	1	her-death.	1
4826	skywalker's-subsequent-emotional-collapse	1	would	1	lead	1	skywalker	1	to	1	fully	1	embrace	1	the-dark-side	1	of	3	the-force	1	and	1	assume	1	the-persona	1	darth-vader,	1	lord	1	the-sith.	1
4827	with	1	darth-vader	2	at	1	side,	1	the-emperor	1	would	1	rule	1	the-newly-styled-galactic-empire	1	for	1	approximately-20-years	1	as	1	the-emperor.	1
4828	initially	1	unknown	1	to	1	darth-vader	1	and	1	sidious,	1	two-children	1	were	1	delivered	1	by	1	padme	2	before	1	.	1
4829	somewhere	1	between	1	the-events	1	of	1	his-last-appearance	1	in	1	solo:	1
4830	ezra	2	is	1	discovered	1	by	1	darth-maul,	1	and	3	together,	1	ahsoka-tano,	1	kanan-jarrus	1	bridger	1	use	1	the-force	1	cooperatively	1	to	1	solve	1	a-series	1	of	1	tests,	1	retrieve	1	a-sith-holocron.	1
4831	maul	1	is	2	defeated	1	by	2	a-sightless-kanan,	1	and	1	darth-vader	1	arrives	1	with	1	the-intention	1	of	1	retrieving	1	the-holocron,	1	but	1	challenged	1	ahsoka,	1	his-former-padawan.	1
4832	even	1	though	1	the-temple	1	is	1	destabilized,	1	ahsoka	1	and	1	darth-vader	1	keep	1	fighting	1	to	1	the-death	2	within	1	the-rapidly-crumbling-building,	1	until	1	eventually	1	explodes,	1	wounding	1	darth-vader.	1
4833	end	1	of	1	the-sith	1	====	1
4834	anakin's-children,	1	leia,	1	and	1	luke-skywalker	1	would	1	become	1	key-members	1	of	1	the-rebel-alliance	1	to	1	restore	1	the-galactic-republic.	1
4835	luke	1	would	1	be	1	secretly	1	tutored	1	in	1	the-ways	1	of	1	the-force	1	by	1	vader's-own-former-jedi-master,	1	obi-wan-kenobi,	1	and	1	a-powerful-elder-jedi,	1	yoda,	1	who	1	also	1	survived	1	palpatine's-purge.	1

4837	darth-sidious	3	offered	1	skywalker	2	an-ultimatum	1	to	4	enter	1	service	1	or	1	die,	1	and	2	proceeded	1	use	1	force-derived	1	powers	1	torture	1	kill	1	when	1	the	1	latter	1	refused	1	embrace	1	the-dark-side	1	of	1	the-force.	1

4839	vader	2	would	1	die	1	of	1	own	1	injuries	1	shortly	1	thereafter,	1	thus	1	apparently	1	bringing	1	an-end	1	to	1	the-sith	1	and	1	their-ancient-vendetta.	1
4840	the-2019-film	1	the-rise	1	of	2	skywalker	1	depicts	1	the-climax	1	the-conflict	1	between	1	the-sith	2	and	2	the-jedi,	1	features	1	the-group	1	known	1	as	1	eternal,	1	led	1	by	1	a-resurrected-darth-sidious.	1

4853	darth-sidious	1	(sheev-palpatine)	1	was	1	a-male-human-dark-lord	1	of	2	the-sith	1	who	1	appeared	1	in	1	each-trilogy	1	the-skywalker-saga.	1
4854	eventually,	1	by	1	manipulating	1	disaffected-political-groups	1	and	1	using	1	double-agents	1	to	2	sow	1	discord,	1	palpatine	2	fomented	1	a-civil-war	1	that	1	provided	1	an-opportunity	1	for	1	seize	1	absolute-power.	1
4855	palpatine	1	had	1	three-known-sith-apprentices:	1	darth-maul,	1	darth-tyranus,	1	and	1	darth-vader.	1
4856	palpatine	2	was	1	eventually	1	betrayed	1	and	1	killed	1	by	1	last,	1	darth-vader,	1	at	1	the-end	1	of	2	return	1	the-jedi.	1
4857	palpatine	1	returned	1	more	1	than	1	30	1	years	1	later	1	in	1	the-rise	1	of	3	skywalker,	1	having	1	managed	1	to	1	cheat	1	death	1	through	1	powerful-mastery	1	the-dark-side	1	the-force.	1
4858	in	2	legends-continuity,	1	darth-sidious'	1	would	1	return	1	using	1	clones	1	and	2	ancient-sith-powers,	1	returning	1	several-clone-bodies	1	over	1	the-course	1	of	1	several-novels	1	comics.	1
4859	during	1	this-time	1	darth-sidious'	1	would	2	briefly	1	turn	1	luke-skywalker	1	to	2	the-dark-side	1	of	2	the-force	2	through	1	sheer-power	1	as	2	much	1	by	2	guile,	1	though	1	luke	2	later	1	be	1	redeemed	1	sister	1	leia	1	and	3	restored	1	the-light-side	1	defeated	1	palpatine	1	once	1	for	1	all.	1

6068	according	1	to	2	lucas,	1	the-correct-order	1	watch	1	the-first-six-episodic-films	1	of	1	the-franchise	1	is	1	by	1	episode-order.	1

6472	they	1	held	1	story-conferences	1	and,	1	by	1	late-november	1	1977,	1	lucas	1	had	1	produced	1	a-handwritten-treatment.	1

6477	author-michael-kaminski	1	argues	1	in	1	the-secret-history	1	of	2	star-wars	1	that	3	it	1	is	1	unlikely	1	the-plot-point	1	had	1	ever	1	seriously	1	been	1	considered	1	or	1	even	1	conceived	1	before	1	1978,	1	and	1	the-first-film	1	was	2	clearly	1	operating	1	under	1	a-storyline	1	where	1	vader	1	a-separate-character	1	from	1	luke's-father.	1
6478	after	1	writing	1	the-second-and-third-drafts	1	in	1	which	1	the-plot-point	1	was	2	introduced,	1	lucas	2	reviewed	1	the	1	new	1	backstory	1	had	3	created:	1	anakin	1	been	1	obi-wan-kenobi's-brilliant-student	1	and	1	a-child	1	named	1	luke,	1	but	1	swayed	1	to	1	the-dark-side	1	by	1	palpatine.	1

6481	after	1	deciding	1	to	2	create	1	the-prequel-trilogy,	1	lucas	1	indicated	1	that	1	the-story-arc	1	would	1	be	1	a-tragic-one	1	depicting	1	anakin's-fall	1	the-dark-side.	1
6482	for	1	the-first-prequel,-episode-i:	1	the-phantom-menace	1	(1999),	1	lucas	1	made	1	anakin	2	nine	1	years	1	old	1	to	1	make	1	the-character's-separation	1	from	1	mother	1	more	1	poignant.	1
6483	movie-trailers	1	focused	1	on	1	anakin	2	and	1	a-one-sheet-poster	1	showing	1	casting	1	vader's-shadow	1	informed	1	otherwise-unknowing-audiences	1	of	1	the-character's-eventual-fate.	1
6484	the-movie	1	ultimately	1	achieved	1	a-primary-goal	1	of	2	introducing	2	audiences	1	to	3	anakin,	1	as	2	well	1	the-concept	1	that	1	anakin	1	is	1	the	1	chosen	1	one	1	an-ancient-jedi-prophecy,	1	destined	1	bring	1	balance	1	the-force.	1

6487	michael-kaminski	1	offers	1	evidence	1	that	1	issues	1	in	3	anakin's-fall	1	to	3	the-dark-side	1	prompted	1	lucas	1	make	1	fundamental-story-changes,	1	first	1	revising	1	the-opening-sequence	1	of	2	revenge	1	the-sith	1	have	1	palpatine	2	kidnapped	1	and	1	apprentice,	1	count-dooku,	1	killed	1	by	1	anakin	1	cold-blood	1	as	1	the-first-act	1	the-latter's-turn	1	towards	1	the-dark-side.	1
6488	after	1	principal-photography	1	was	2	complete	1	in	2	2003,	1	lucas	1	re-wrote	1	anakin's-turn	1	to	3	the-dark-side;	1	anakin's-fall	1	from	1	grace	1	would	1	now	1	be	1	motivated	1	by	1	a-desire	1	save	1	michael-kaminski-wife,	1	padmé-amidala,	1	rather	1	than	1	the-previous-version	1	which	1	that-reason	1	one	1	of	1	several,	1	including	1	that	2	michael-kaminski	1	genuinely	1	believed	1	the-jedi	1	were	1	plotting	1	take	1	over	1	the-republic.	1
6489	this	1	fundamental	1	re-write	1	was	2	accomplished	1	both	1	through	1	editing	1	the-principal-footage,	1	and	1	new-and-revised-scenes	1	filmed	1	during	1	pick-ups	1	in	3	2004.during-production	1	of	3	the-animated-the-clone-wars-television-series,	1	ahsoka-tano	1	developed	1	to	2	illustrate	1	how	1	anakin	1	develops	1	from	1	the-brash,-undisciplined-padawan-apprentice	1	attack	1	the-clones	1	(2002)	1	the-more-reserved-jedi-knight	1	revenge	1	the-sith.	1
6490	dave-filoni	1	said	1	that	2	giving	1	anakin-responsibility	1	for	1	a-padawan	1	was	1	meant	1	to	2	place	1	the-character	2	in	1	a-role	1	forced	1	become	1	more	1	cautious	1	and	1	responsible.	1
6491	it	1	would	1	also	1	give	1	the-character	2	insight	1	into	1	relationship	1	with	1	obi-wan	1	and	1	depict	1	how	1	their-relationship	1	matured.	1
6492	ahsoka	1	and	1	anakin's-relationship	1	was	1	seen	1	as	1	an-essential-story-arc	1	spanning	1	both-the-animated-film-and-clone-wars-television-series.	1
6493	filoni	5	began	1	thinking	1	about	1	the-final-confrontation	1	between	1	ahsoka	2	and	1	vader	2	ever	1	since	1	created	1	the	1	former;	1	different-iterations	1	had	1	different-endings,	1	including	1	one	1	in	1	which	1	kills	1	just	1	as	1	slashes	1	open	1	helmet	1	to	1	reveal	1	scarred	1	face.	1
6494	a-similar-scene	1	is	1	included	1	in	2	an-episode	1	of	1	rebels,	1	which	1	ahsoka	1	slashes	1	vader's	1	helmet	1	open,	1	and	1	the-sith-lord	1	recognizes	1	her.	1
6495	according	1	to	2	filoni,	1	ahsoka's-presence	1	in	1	the-series	1	allows	1	vader	1	encounter	1	the-show's-lead-characters	1	without	1	the	1	latter	1	being	1	"destroyed",	1	as	1	ahsoka	1	can	1	"stand	1	toe-to-toe"	1	with	1	her-former-master.	1
6496	the-idea	1	that	1	darth-vader's	1	should	1	wear	1	a-breathing-apparatus	1	was	1	first	1	proposed	1	by	1	concept-artist-ralph-mcquarrie	1	during	1	preproduction-discussions	1	for	1	star-wars	1	with	1	george-lucas	1	in	1	1975.	1
6497	lucas	1	agreed,	1	and	1	mcquarrie	1	combined	1	a-full-face-breathing-mask	1	with	1	a-samurai-helmet,	1	thus	1	creating	1	one	1	of	2	the-most-iconic-designs	1	space-fantasy-cinema.	1

6499	its-similarity	1	to	2	the-final-design	1	of	2	darth-vader's-costume	1	demonstrates	1	that	2	mcquarrie's-earliest-conception	1	darth-vader	1	was	1	so	1	successful	1	very	1	little	1	needed	1	be	1	changed	1	for	1	production.	1

6581	palpatine	2	also	1	appoints	1	anakin	1	to	1	the-jedi-council	1	as	1	personal	1	representative.	1
6582	suspicious	1	of	2	palpatine,	2	the-council	1	allows	1	anakin	1	as	1	a-member,	1	but	1	declines	1	to	2	grant	1	palpatine	2	the-rank	1	jedi-master	1	and	1	instead	1	instructs	1	spy	1	on	1	diminishing	1	anakin's	1	trust	1	in	1	the-jedi.	1
6583	later,	1	palpatine	2	reveals	1	to	2	anakin	1	that	2	is	1	the-sith-lord-darth-sidious,	1	and	1	says	1	only	1	he	1	has	1	the-power	1	save	1	padmé	1	from	1	dying.	1

6847	star-wars-creator-george-lucas,	1	who	1	had	1	two-daughters,	1	also	1	wanted	1	the-character	1	to	2	appeal	1	girls.	1
6848	lucas	2	renamed	1	after	1	the-ancient-indian-emperor	1	ashoka;	1	the-spelling	1	was	1	then	1	altered	1	by	1	screenwriter-henry-gilroy.	1
6849	the-clone-wars-supervising-director	1	and	1	writer-dave-filoni	1	imagined	1	the-discovery	1	that	1	lucas	2	has	1	"the-right-stuff"	1	to	1	become	1	a-jedi	1	would	1	be	1	a-cause	1	for	1	celebration	1	in	1	hometown.	1
6850	giving	1	anakin-responsibility	1	for	1	a-padawan	1	was	1	meant	1	to	2	place	1	the-ahsoka-character	2	in	1	a-role	1	that	1	forced	1	become	1	more	1	cautious	1	and	1	responsible.	1
6851	it	1	would	1	also	1	provide	1	the-ahsoka-character	3	with	2	insight	1	into	1	relationship	2	own-master,	2	obi-wan-kenobi,	1	and	1	depict	1	how	1	his	1	obi-wan-kenobi	1	matured.	1
6852	ahsoka	1	and	2	anakin's-relationship	1	was	1	seen	1	as	1	an-essential-story-arc	1	spanning	1	both-the-animated-film	1	the-clone-wars-television-series.	1
6853	filoni	2	initially	1	struggled	1	with	1	writing	1	ahsoka	1	because	1	had	1	"zero-perspective"	1	on	1	what	1	it	1	was	1	like	1	to	1	be	1	a-14-year-old-girl.	1
6854	filoni,	1	therefore,	1	shifted	1	filoni	1	focus	1	and	1	instead	1	wrote	1	ahsoka	1	primarily	1	as	1	a-jedi	1	who	1	just	1	happens	1	to	1	be	1	an-adolescent-female.	1
6855	filoni	3	began	1	thinking	1	about	1	the-final-confrontation	1	between	1	ahsoka	2	and	1	vader	2	ever	1	since	1	created	1	ahsoka;	1	different-iterations	1	had	1	different-endings,	1	including	1	one	1	in	1	which	1	kills	1	just	1	as	1	she	1	slashes	1	open	1	helmet	1	to	1	reveal	1	anakin's-scarred-face.	1
6856	ashley-eckstein,	1	who	1	primarily	1	voiced	1	ahsoka,	1	said	1	she	1	and	3	the-writers	1	were	1	aware	1	that	2	audiences	1	initially	1	found	1	the-character	1	annoying,	1	there	1	was	1	a-"fine-line"	1	between	1	ahsoka	1	being	1	bratty	1	becoming	1	endearing.	1
6857	because	1	production	1	was	2	a	1	year	1	ahead	1	of	1	what	1	broadcast,	1	with	2	ahsoka	1	developing	1	over	1	that-time,	1	eckstein	1	implored	1	fans	1	to	1	be	1	patient	1	the-character's-growth.	1
6858	although	1	ahsoka	1	leaves	1	the-jedi-order	1	at	1	the-end	1	of	1	the-clone-wars'-fifth-season,	1	the-storyline	1	initially	1	had	1	she	1	return	1	to	1	the-jedi-order.	1
6859	filoni	2	said	1	this	1	would	1	be	1	the-"normal"-arc	1	and	1	suggested	1	to	1	lucas	2	that	1	instead	1	remain	1	expelled;	1	agreed.	1
6860	lucas	1	believed	1	ahsoka	1	survived	1	order	1	66,	1
6861	filoni,	1	who	1	served	1	as	1	executive-producer	1	and	1	co-creator	1	of	1	rebels,	1	worked	1	with	1	lucas	1	on	1	identifying	1	what	1	ahsoka	1	would	1	know	1	about	1	anakin's-fate.	1
6862	consequently,	1	filoni	1	required	1	that	1	ahsoka	1	play	1	a-role	1	in	2	service	1	of	1	rebels'-main-characters,	1	ezra-bridger	2	and	1	kanan-jarrus;	1	saw	1	ahsoka's	1	new	1	role	1	as	1	similar	1	to	1	the-one	1	played	1	by	1	obi-wan-kenobi	1	star-wars.	1
6863	although	1	ahsoka	1	is	1	more	1	mature	1	in	1	rebels,	1	filoni	1	wanted	1	"aspects	1	of	1	that-kid	1	who	1	was	1	there	1	to	1	shine	1	through".	1
6864	filoni	1	initially	1	envisioned	1	ahsoka	2	as	2	a-more-"passive-player"	1	not	1	engaged	1	in	1	combat,	1	but	1	later	1	decided	1	it	1	was	1	more	1	appropriate	1	to	1	see	1	a-warrior	1	during	1	a-turbulent-time.	1
6865	ahsoka's-presence	1	was	1	necessary	1	to	2	allow	1	darth-vader	1	encounter	1	the-show's-lead-characters	1	without	1	the	1	latter	1	being	1	destroyed;	1	ahsoka	1	can	1	stand	1	toe-to-toe	1	with	1	darth-vader.	1
6866	filoni	1	cites	1	fans'-passion	1	for	2	the-character	1	as	1	one-reason	1	ahsoka's-prominence	1	in	1	clone-wars	1	and	1	rebels.	1
6867	eckstein	2	said	1	filoni	6	wanted	1	to	1	bring	1	some	1	of	1	own	1	personality	1	into	1	the-ahsoka-character;	1	told	1	that	1	actions	1	and	1	speech	1	between	1	audition	1	takes	1	had	1	a-bigger-impact	1	on	1	getting	1	the-role	1	than	1	the-actual-audition.	1
6868	once	1	production	1	on	1	the-clone-wars	1	began,	1	it	1	took	1	about-six-months	1	for	2	eckstein	1	and	1	the-writers	1	to	1	understand	1	ahsoka;	1	consequently,	1	much	1	of	2	the-dialogue	1	the-first-half	1	season	1
6869	eckstein	1	reprised	1	the-role	1	of	2	ahsoka	1	for	1	rebels,	1	although	1	she	1	did	1	not	1	do	1	all	1	fulcrum's-voice-work.	1
6870	eckstein	1	said	1	ahsoka	1	developed	1	a-quiet-confidence	1	and	1	quiet-strength	1
6871	eckstein	1	doesn't	1	possess,	1	but	1	sometimes	1	ahsoka	3	played	1	too	1	seriously;	1	pointed	1	out	1	that	1	"snippiness"	1	and	1	determination	1	are	1	still	1	part	1	of	1	ahsoka's	1	personality.	1
6872	eckstein	1	pitched	1	ahsoka	3	voice	1	down	1	a	1	bit	1	but,	1	because	1	and	1	were	1	now	1	much	1	closer	1	in	1	age,	1	generally	1	spoke	1	like	1	ahsoka.	1
6873	not	1	knowing	1	ahsoka's-experiences	1	between	1	the-clone-wars	1	and	1	rebels	1	at	1	times	1	presented	1	challenges	1	for	1	eckstein's-performance.	1
6874	filoni	2	avoids	1	giving	1	the-actors	2	plot-details	1	that	2	might	1	inappropriately	1	affect	1	performance;	1	for	1	example,	1	did	1	not	2	tell	1	eckstein	2	whether	1	ahsoka	3	survives	1	duel	1	with	1	darth-vader	1	lest	1	telegraph	1	something	1	in	1	performance	1	the-character	1	would	1	know.	1
6875	ahsoka's-design	1	evolved	1	over	1	three-years	1	before	1	ahsoka	1	introduction	1	in	1	the-clone-wars-film.	1
6876	ahsoka	1	initially	1	appears	1	in	1	what	1	wired	1	called	1	a	1	"tube-top-and-miniskirt	1	costume.	1
6877	in	1	the-third-season,	1	ahsoka	1	and	1	other-characters	1	received	1	new-costumes.	1
6878	filoni	1	said	1	the-changes	1	were	2	meant	1	to	2	bring	1	the	1	show's	1	aesthetic	1	closer	1	that	1	of	2	revenge	1	the-sith	1	and	1	made	1	possible	1	by	1	improved-animation-techniques.	1

6880	along	1	with	1	the-costume-change	1	in	1	the-third-season	1	of	1	clone-wars,	1	ahsoka	1	also	1	received	1	a-second-lightsaber.	1

7363	after	1	deciding	1	to	2	create	1	the-prequel-trilogy,	1	lucas	1	indicated	1	that	1	the-story-arc	1	would	1	be	1	a-tragic-one	1	depicting	1	anakin's-fall	1	the-dark-side.	1
7364	lucas	2	also	1	saw	1	that	2	the-prequels	1	could	1	form	1	the-beginning	1	of	1	one-long-story	1	started	1	with	2	anakin's-childhood	1	and	1	ended	1	death.	1
7365	for	1	the-first-prequel,-episode-i:	1	the-phantom-menace	1	(1999),	1	lucas	1	made	1	anakin	2	nine	1	years	1	old	1	to	1	make	1	the-character's-separation	1	from	1	mother	1	more	1	poignant.	1
7366	movie-trailers	1	focused	1	on	1	anakin	2	and	1	a-one-sheet-poster	1	showing	1	casting	1	vader's-shadow	1	informed	1	otherwise-unknowing-audiences	1	of	1	the-character's-eventual-fate.	1
7367	the-movie	1	ultimately	1	achieved	1	a-primary-goal	1	of	2	introducing	2	audiences	1	to	3	anakin,	1	as	2	well	1	the-concept	1	that	1	anakin	1	is	1	the	1	chosen	1	one	1	an-ancient-jedi-prophecy,	1	destined	1	bring	1	balance	1	the-force.	1

7369	even	1	when	1	anakin	2	turns	1	into	1	darth-vader,	1	is	1	still	1	the	1	chosen	1	one.	1
7370	"michael-kaminski	1	offers	1	evidence	1	that	1	issues	1	in	3	anakin's-fall	1	to	3	the-dark-side	1	prompted	1	lucas	1	make	1	fundamental-story-changes,	1	first	1	revising	1	the-opening-sequence	1	of	2	revenge	1	the-sith	1	have	1	palpatine	2	kidnapped	1	and	1	apprentice,	1	count-dooku,	1	killed	1	by	1	anakin	1	cold-blood	1	as	1	the-first-act	1	the-latter's-turn	1	towards	1	the-dark-side.	1
7371	after	1	principal-photography	1	was	2	complete	1	in	2	2003,	1	lucas	1	re-wrote	1	anakin's-turn	1	to	3	the-dark-side;	1	anakin's-fall	1	from	1	grace	1	would	1	now	1	be	1	motivated	1	by	1	a-desire	1	save	1	his-wife,	1	padmé-amidala,	1	rather	1	than	1	the-previous-version	1	which	1	that-reason	1	one	1	of	1	several,	1	including	1	that	2	his	1	genuinely	1	believed	1	the-jedi	1	were	1	plotting	1	take	1	over	1	the-republic.	1
7372	this	1	fundamental	1	re-write	1	was	2	accomplished	1	both	1	through	1	editing	1	the-principal-footage,	1	and	1	new-and-revised-scenes	1	filmed	1	during	1	pick-ups	1	in	3	2004.during-production	1	of	3	the-animated-the-clone-wars-television-series,	1	ahsoka-tano	1	developed	1	to	2	illustrate	1	how	1	anakin	1	develops	1	from	1	the-brash,-undisciplined-padawan-apprentice	1	attack	1	the-clones	1	(2002)	1	the-more-reserved-jedi-knight	1	revenge	1	the-sith.	1
7373	dave-filoni	1	said	1	that	2	giving	1	anakin-responsibility	1	for	1	a-padawan	1	was	1	meant	1	to	2	place	1	the-character	2	in	1	a-role	1	forced	1	become	1	more	1	cautious	1	and	1	responsible.	1
7374	it	1	would	1	also	1	give	1	the-character	2	insight	1	into	1	relationship	1	with	1	obi-wan	1	and	1	depict	1	how	1	their-relationship	1	matured.	1
7375	ahsoka	1	and	1	anakin's-relationship	1	was	1	seen	1	as	1	an-essential-story-arc	1	spanning	1	both-the-animated-film-and-clone-wars-television-series.	1
7376	dave-filoni	5	began	1	thinking	1	about	1	the-final-confrontation	1	between	1	ahsoka	2	and	1	vader	2	ever	1	since	1	created	1	the	1	former;	1	different-iterations	1	had	1	different-endings,	1	including	1	one	1	in	1	which	1	kills	1	just	1	as	1	slashes	1	open	1	helmet	1	to	1	reveal	1	scarred	1	face.	1
7377	a-similar-scene	1	is	1	included	1	in	2	an-episode	1	of	1	rebels,	1	which	1	ahsoka	1	slashes	1	vader's	1	helmet	1	open,	1	and	1	the-sith-lord	1	recognizes	1	her.	1
7378	according	1	to	2	filoni,	1	ahsoka's-presence	1	in	1	the-series	1	allows	1	vader	1	encounter	1	the-show's-lead-characters	1	without	1	the	1	latter	1	being	1	"destroyed",	1	as	1	ahsoka	1	can	1	"stand	1	toe-to-toe"	1	with	1	her-former-master.	1
7379	the-idea	1	that	1	vader	1	should	1	wear	1	a-breathing-apparatus	1	was	1	first	1	proposed	1	by	1	concept-artist-ralph-mcquarrie	1	during	1	preproduction-discussions	1	for	1	star-wars	1	with	1	george-lucas	1	in	1	1975.	1
