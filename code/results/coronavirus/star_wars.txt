Misinformation and criticism ==
Mexico's federal government was perceived as slow to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as of late March 2020, and it was met with criticism from certain sectors of society and the media.
Through April 1, the government only performed 10,000 tests, compared to 200,000 that had been completed in New York state.
Therefore, official statistics are likely to greatly underestimate the actual number of cases.
The New York Times reported on May 8, 2020 that the federal government is underreporting deaths in Mexico City; the federal government reports 700 deaths in the city while local officials have detected over 2,500.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador
continued to hold rallies, be hands-on with crowds, and downplay the threat of coronavirus to health and the economy.
Miguel Barbosa Huerta, the governor of Puebla, claimed that only the wealthy were at risk of COVID-19, since the poor are immune.
There is no evidence that wealth affects a person's vulnerability to the virus.
Rumors about a curfew sparked the barricading of streets in San Felipe del Progreso, State of Mexico, on May 8, 2020.
A rumor spread via WhatsApp that authorities were spreading gas contaminated with COVID-19 provoked vandalism of police cars in San Mateo Capulhuac, Otzolotepec, on May 9.

A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID‑19).
Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, there was an established body of knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which enabled accelerated development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020.
On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19.In Phase III trials, several COVID‑19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID‑19 infections.
As of April 2021, 13 vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: two RNA vaccines (the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine), five conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, CoronaVac, Covaxin, WIBP-CorV and CoviVac), four viral vector vaccines (Sputnik V, the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, Convidecia, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine), and two protein subunit vaccines (EpiVacCorona and RBD-Dimer).
In total, as of March 2021, 308 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with 73 in clinical research, including 24 in Phase
I trials, 33 in Phase I–II trials, and 16 in Phase III development.
Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.
Stanley Plotkin and Neal Halsey wrote an article published by Oxford Clinical Infectious Diseases that urged single dose interim use in order to extend vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability improved.
Several other articles and media provided evidence for delaying second doses in the same line of reasoning.
As of 27 April 2021, 1.06 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccine have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies.
AstraZeneca-Oxford anticipates producing three billion doses in 2021, Pfizer–BioNTech 1.3 billion doses, and Sputnik V, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Johnson & Johnson one billion doses each.
Moderna targets producing 600 million doses and Convidecia 500 million doses in 2021.
By December 2020, more than ten billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries, with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising 14% of the world's population.

==
Background ==
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans.
However, vaccines have been produced against several animal diseases caused by coronaviruses, including (as of 2003) infectious bronchitis virus in birds, canine coronavirus, and feline coronavirus.
Previous projects to develop vaccines for viruses in the family Coronaviridae that affect humans have been aimed at severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animals.

According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world at that time.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine proven to be safe and effective against SARS in humans.
There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based)
MERS vaccine which completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others in progress, all being viral-vectored vaccines: two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).

==
Planning and development ==
Since January 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.
According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the geographic distribution of COVID‑19 vaccine development puts North American entities having about 40% of the activity compared to 30% in Asia and Australia, 26% in Europe, and a few projects in South America and Africa.
Multiple steps along the entire development path are evaluated, including:
the level of acceptable toxicity of the vaccine (its safety),
targeting vulnerable populations,
the need for vaccine efficacy breakthroughs,
the duration of vaccination protection,
special delivery systems (such as oral or nasal, rather than by injection),
dose regimen,
stability and storage characteristics,
emergency use authorization before formal licensing,
optimal manufacturing for scaling to billions of doses, and
dissemination of the licensed vaccine.

===
Challenges ===
There have been several unique challenges with COVID-19 vaccine development.

The urgency to create a vaccine for COVID‑19 led to compressed schedules that shortened the standard vaccine development timeline, in some cases combining clinical trial steps over months, a process typically conducted sequentially over years.
Timelines for conducting clinical research – normally a sequential process requiring years – are being compressed into safety, efficacy, and dosing trials running simultaneously over months, potentially compromising safety assurance.
As an example, Chinese vaccine developers and the government Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began their efforts in January 2020, and by March were pursuing numerous candidates on short timelines, with the goal to showcase Chinese technology strengths over those of the United States, and to reassure the Chinese people about the quality of vaccines produced in China.
The rapid development and urgency of producing a vaccine for the COVID‑19 pandemic may increase the risks and failure rate of delivering a safe, effective vaccine.
Additionally, research at universities is obstructed by physical distancing and closing of laboratories.
Vaccines must progress through several phases of clinical trials to test for safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, dose levels and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine.
Vaccine developers have to invest resources internationally to find enough participants for Phase II–III clinical trials when the virus has proved to be a "moving target" of changing transmission rate across and within countries, forcing companies to compete for trial participants; clinical trial organizers may encounter people unwilling to be vaccinated due to vaccine hesitancy or disbelieving the science of the vaccine technology and its ability to prevent infection.
Even as new vaccines are developed during the COVID‑19 pandemic, licensure of COVID‑19 vaccine candidates requires submission of a full dossier of information on development and manufacturing quality.

===
Organizations ===
Internationally, the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator is a G20 and World Health Organization (WHO) initiative announced in April 2020.
It is a cross-discipline support structure to enable partners to share resources and knowledge.
It comprises four pillars, each managed by two to three collaborating partners:
Vaccines (also called "COVAX"), Diagnostics, Therapeutics, and Health Systems Connector.
The WHO's April 2020 "R&D Blueprint (for the) novel Coronavirus" documented a "large, international, multi-site, individually randomized controlled clinical trial" to allow "the concurrent evaluation of the benefits and risks of each promising candidate vaccine within 3–6 months of it being made available for the trial.
"
The WHO vaccine coalition will prioritize which vaccines should go into Phase II and III clinical trials, and determine harmonized Phase III protocols for all vaccines achieving the pivotal trial stage.
National governments have also been involved in vaccine development.
Canada announced funding for 96 research vaccine research projects at Canadian companies and universities, with plans to establish a "vaccine bank" that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs, and to support clinical trials and develop manufacturing and supply chains for vaccines.
China provided low-rate loans to a vaccine developer through its central bank and "quickly made land available for the company" to build production plants.
Three Chinese vaccine companies and research institutes are supported by the government for financing research, conducting clinical trials, and manufacturing.
Great Britain formed a COVID‑19 vaccine task force in April 2020 to stimulate local efforts for accelerated development of a vaccine through collaborations of industry, universities, and government agencies.
It encompassed every phase of development from research to manufacturing.
In the United States, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a federal agency funding disease-fighting technology, announced investments to support American COVID‑19 vaccine development and manufacture of the most promising candidates.
In May 2020, the government announced funding for a fast-track program called Operation Warp Speed.
Large pharmaceutical companies with experience in making vaccines at scale, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), formed alliances with biotechnology companies, governments, and universities to accelerate progression to an effective vaccine.

===
History ===


==
Vaccine types ==
As of January 2021, nine different technology platforms – with the technology of numerous candidates remaining undefined – are under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19.
Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection.
Platforms being developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.
Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precision on COVID‑19 infection mechanisms.
Several of the synthetic vaccines use a 2P mutation to lock the spike protein into its prefusion configuration, stimulating an immune response to the virus before it attaches to a human cell.
Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‑19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with existing weakened immune systems.
===
RNA vaccines ===
An RNA vaccine contains RNA which, when introduced into a tissue, acts as messenger RNA (mRNA) to cause the cells to build the foreign protein and stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells.
RNA vaccines often, but not always, use nucleoside-modified messenger RNA.
The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.
RNA vaccines were the first COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized in the United States and the European Union.
As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Pfizer–BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
As of February 2021, the CVnCoV RNA vaccine from CureVac is awaiting authorization in the EU.Severe allergic reactions are rare.
In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis.
For 4,041,396 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose administrations in December 2020 and January 2021, only ten cases of anaphylaxis were reported.
The lipid nanoparticles were most likely responsible for the allergic reactions.

===
Adenovirus vector vaccines ===
These vaccines are examples of non-replicating viral vector vaccines, using an adenovirus shell containing DNA that encodes a SARS‑CoV‑2 protein.
The viral vector-based vaccines against COVID-19 are non-replicating, meaning that they do not make new virus particles, but rather produce only the antigen which elicits a systemic immune response.
As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine, the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, Convidecia, and the Johnson & Johnson
COVID-19 vaccine.
Convidecia and the Johnson & Johnson
COVID-19 vaccine are both one-shot vaccines which offer less complicated logistics and can be stored under ordinary refrigeration for several months.
The Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine uses Ad26
for the first dose, which is the same as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine's only dose, and Ad5 for the second dose.
Convidecia uses Ad5 for its only dose.

===
Inactivated virus vaccines ===
Inactivated vaccines consist of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then are killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde to lose disease producing capacity, while still stimulating an immune response.
As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Chinese CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and WIBP-CorV; the Indian Covaxin; and the Russian CoviVac.
Vaccines in clinical trials include the Valneva COVID-19 vaccine.

===
Subunit vaccines ===
Subunit vaccines present one or more antigens without introducing whole pathogen particles.
The antigens involved are often protein subunits, but can be any molecule that is a fragment of the pathogen.
As of April 2021, the two authorized vaccines of this type are the peptide vaccine EpiVacCorona and RBD-Dimer.
Vaccines with pending authorizations include the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, SOBERANA 02
(a conjugate vaccine), and the Sanofi–GSK vaccine.
The V451 vaccine was previously in clinical trials, which were terminated because it was found that the vaccine may potentially cause incorrect results for subsequent HIV testing.
===
Other types ===
Additional types of vaccines that are in clinical trials include virus-like particle vaccines, multiple DNA plasmid vaccines, at least two lentivirus vector vaccines, a conjugate vaccine, and a vesicular stomatitis virus displaying the SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein.
Oral vaccines and intranasal vaccines are being developed and studied.
Scientists investigated whether existing vaccines for unrelated conditions could prime the immune system and lessen the severity of COVID‑19 infection.
There is experimental evidence that the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific effects on the immune system, but no evidence that this vaccine is effective against COVID‑19.
==
Efficacy ==
Vaccine efficacy is the risk of getting the disease by vaccinated participants in a controlled trial compared with the risk of getting the disease by unvaccinated participants.
An efficacy of 0% means that the vaccine does not work (identical to placebo).
An efficacy of 50% means that there are half as many cases of infection as in unvaccinated individuals.

It is not straightforward to compare the efficacies of the different vaccines because the trials were run with different populations, geographies, and variants of the virus.
In the case of COVID‑19, a vaccine efficacy of 67% may be enough to slow the pandemic, but this assumes that the vaccine confers sterilizing immunity, which is necessary to prevent transmission.
Vaccine efficacy reflects disease prevention, a poor indicator of transmissibility of SARS‑CoV‑2 since asymptomatic people can be highly infectious.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) set a cutoff of 50% as the efficacy required to approve a COVID‑19 vaccine.
Aiming for a realistic population vaccination coverage rate of 75%, and depending on the actual basic reproduction number, the necessary effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine is expected to need to be at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and at least 80% to extinguish it without further measures, such as social distancing.
In efficacy calculations, symptomatic COVID-19 is generally defined as having both a positive PCR test and at least one or two of a defined list of COVID-19 symptoms, although exact specifications vary between trials.
The trial location also affects the reported efficacy because different countries have different prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Ranges below are 95% confidence intervals unless indicated otherwise, and all values are for all participants regardless of age, according to the references for each of the trials.
By definition, the absence of a confidence interval means that the accuracy of the estimates without an associated confidence interval is unknown to the public.
Efficacy against severe COVID-19 is the most important, since hospitalizations and deaths are a public health burden whose prevention is a priority.
Authorized and approved vaccines have shown the following efficacies:


===
Effectiveness ===
The real-world studies of vaccine effectiveness measure to which extent a certain vaccine has succeeded in preventing COVID-19 infection, symptoms, hospitalization and death for the vaccinated individuals in a large population under routine conditions that are less than ideal.

In Israel, among the 715,425 individuals vaccinated by the Moderna/Pfizer vaccine during 20 December 2020, to 28 January 2021, it was observed for the period starting seven days after the second shot, that only 317 people (0.04%) became sick with mild/moderate Covid-19 symptoms and only 16 people (0.002%) were hospitalized.

Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19
vaccines provide highly effective protection, according to a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness of full immunization (≥14 days after second dose) was 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless of symptom status; vaccine effectiveness of partial immunization (
≥14 days after first dose but before second dose) was 80%.

15,121 health care workers from 104 hospitals in England, that all had tested negative for COVID-19 antibodies prior of the study, were followed by RT-PCR tests twice a week from 7 December 2020 to 5 February 2021, during a time when lineage B.1.1.7 was in circulation as the dominant variant.
The study compared the positive results for the 90.7% vaccinated share of their cohort with the 9.3% unvaccinated share, and found that the Pfizer vaccine reduced all infections (including asymptomatic), by 72% (58-86%) three weeks after the first dose and 86% (76-97%) one week after the second dose.

A study of the general population in Israel conducted from 17 January to 6 March 2021, during a time when lineage B.1.1.7 was in circulation as the dominant variant, found that the Pfizer vaccine reduced asymptomatic COVID-19 infections by 94% and symptomatic COVID-19 infections by 97%.

A study, among pre-surgical patients across the Mayo Clinic system in the United States, showed that mRNA vaccines were 80% protective against asymptomatic infections.

The director of the China Center for Disease Control, Gao Fu, admitted that Chinese vaccines "don't have very high protection rates" at a conference held on 10 April 2021.
The CoronaVac vaccine developed by Sinovac, a private company, was found to have an efficacy rate of just 50.4% in clinical trials in Brazil.
Another trial in Turkey showed it was 83.5% effective.
State-owned Sinopharm said its two vaccines have efficacy rates of 79.4% and 72.5%.

===
Variants ===
The potential emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant that is moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the current generation of COVID-19 vaccines may necessitate modification of the vaccines.
Trials indicate many vaccines developed for the initial strain have lower efficacy for some variants against symptomatic COVID-19.
As of February 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration believed that all FDA authorized vaccines remained effective in protecting against circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.

====
B.1.1.7 variant ====
In December 2020, a new SARS‑CoV‑2 variant, B.1.1.7, was identified in the UK.Early results suggest protection to the UK variant from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
One study indicated that the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine had an efficacy of 42–89% against the B.1.1.7 variant, versus 71–91% against non-B.1.1.7 variants.
Preliminary data from a clinical trial indicates that the Novavax vaccine is ~96% effective for symptoms against the original variant and~86% against B.1.1.7In April 2021, it was reported that the level of neutralisation for the CoronaVac vaccine against B.1.17 is 50% effective in comparaison with the original Wuhan strain.
For comparaison, in the same study they analysed that convalescents' (~5 months since contraction)
B.1.17 neutralisation was "similar" to Wuhan strain.

====
501.V2
variant ====
Moderna has launched a trial of a vaccine to tackle the South African 501.V2 variant (also known as B.1.351).
On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity was reduced by two-thirds for the 501.V2 variant, while stating that no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made.
Decreased neutralizing activity of sera from patients vaccinated with Moderna and Pfizer vaccines against B.1.351 was latter confirmed by several studies.
On 1 April 2021, an update on a Pfizer/BioNTech South African vaccine trial stated that the vaccine was 100% effective so far (i.e., vaccinated participants saw no cases), with six of nine infections in the placebo control group being the B.1.351 variant.
In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson, which held trials for its Ad26.COV2.S vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States and 57% in South Africa.
On 6 February 2021, the Financial Times reported that provisional trial data from a study undertaken by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand in conjunction with Oxford University demonstrated reduced efficacy of the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine against the 501.V2 variant.
The study found that in a sample size of 2,000 the AZD1222 vaccine afforded only "minimal protection" in all but the most severe cases of COVID-19.
On 7 February 2021, the Minister for Health for South Africa suspended the planned deployment of about a million doses of the vaccine whilst they examine the data and await advice on how to proceed.
In March 2021, it was reported that the "preliminary efficay" of the Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) against B.1.351 for mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 for
HIV-negative participants is 51%.In April 2021, it was reported that the level of neutralisation for the CoronaVac vaccine was only 30% effective in comparaison with the original Wuhan strain.
For comparaison, in the same study they analysed that convalescents' (~5 months since contraction)
B.1.351 neutralisation was 50% effective.

====
P1 variant ====
The P1 variant (also known as 20J/501Y.V3), initially identified in Brazil, seems to partially escape vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine.

==
Trial and authorization status ==
Phase
I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in a few dozen healthy subjects,
while Phase II trials – following success in Phase I – evaluate immunogenicity, dose levels (efficacy based on biomarkers) and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine, typically in hundreds of people.
A Phase
I–II trial consists of preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, while determining more precise, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants at multiple sites, include a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease (an "interventional" or "pivotal" trial), while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Definition of vaccine safety, efficacy, and clinical endpoints in a Phase III trial may vary between the trials of different companies, such as defining the degree of side effects, infection or amount of transmission, and whether the vaccine prevents moderate or severe COVID‑19 infection.
A clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an "adaptive design" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.
Adaptive designs within ongoing Phase II–
III clinical trials on candidate vaccines may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early termination or success, avoiding duplication of research efforts, and enhancing coordination of design changes for the Solidarity trial across its international locations.

===
List of authorized and approved vaccines ===
National regulatory authorities have granted emergency use authorizations for thirteen vaccines.
Six of those have been approved for emergency or full use by at least one WHO-recognized stringent regulatory authority.

===
Vaccine candidates in human trials ===
== Formulation ==
As of September 2020, eleven of the vaccine candidates in clinical development use adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity.
An immunological adjuvant is a substance formulated with a vaccine to elevate the immune response to an antigen, such as the COVID‑19 virus or influenza virus.
Specifically, an adjuvant may be used in formulating a COVID‑19 vaccine candidate to boost its immunogenicity and efficacy to reduce or prevent COVID‑19 infection in vaccinated individuals.
Adjuvants used in COVID‑19 vaccine formulation may be particularly effective for technologies using the inactivated COVID‑19 virus and recombinant protein-based or vector-based vaccines.
Aluminum salts, known as "alum", were the first adjuvant used for licensed vaccines, and are the adjuvant of choice in some 80% of adjuvanted vaccines.
The alum adjuvant initiates diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms to enhance immunogenicity, including release of proinflammatory cytokines.

==
Distribution ==
===
Inequity concerns ===
In an April 15 meeting published on the 19th, the World Health Organisation’s emergency committee addressed concerns of persistent inequity in the global vaccine distribution.

== Liability ==
On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID‑19, covering "any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID‑19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the declaration precludes "liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct".
The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.In
the European Union, the COVID‑19 vaccines are licensed under a Conditional Marketing Authorisation which does not exempt manufacturers from civil and administrative liability claims.
While the purchasing contracts with vaccine manufacturers remain secret, they do not contain liability exemptions even for side-effects not known at the time of licensure.
Pfizer has been criticised for demanding far-reaching liability waivers and other guarantees from countries such as Argentina and Brazil, which go beyond what was expected from other countries such as the US (above).

==
Preventive measures after vaccination ==
When a person has received vaccination against COVID (receiving all the necessary vaccine doses, and when the established times after vaccination have passed), it is still possible to spread the infection, but with a lesser probability.
Besides, the vaccines fail for a small proportion of the vaccinated people, although some argue that this is the case for most vaccines.

Public health agencies recommend that vaccinated people continue using preventive measures (washing hands with soap, wearing face masks, keeping social distance) to avoid infecting others, especially to vulnerable people.
Governments have claimed that these restrictions would end when the dangers of the pandemic are officially ended.

==
Society and culture ==


===
Access ===
Nations pledged to buy doses of COVID‑19 vaccine before the doses were available.
Though high-income nations represent only 14% of the global population, as of 15 November 2020, they had contracted to buy 51% of all pre-sold doses.
Some high-income nations bought more doses than would be necessary to vaccinate their entire populations.
On 18 January 2021, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned of problems with equitable distribution: "More than 39 million doses of vaccine have now been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries.
Just 25 doses have been given in one lowest-income country.
Not 25 million; not 25 thousand; just 25."

In March, it was revealed the US attempted to convince Brazil not to purchase the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, fearing "Russian influence" in Latin America.
Some nations involved in long-standing territorial disputes have reportedly had their access to vaccines blocked by competing nations; Palestine has accused Israel blocking vaccine delivery to Gaza, while Taiwan has suggested that China has hampered its efforts to procure vaccine doses.
A single dose of the COVID‑19 vaccine by AstraZeneca would cost 47 Egyptian pounds (EGP) and the authorities are selling it between 100 and 200 EGP.
A report by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace cited the current poverty rate in Egypt as around 29.7 percent, which constitutes approximately 30.5 million people, and claimed that about 15 million of the Egyptians would be unable to gain access to the luxury of vaccination.
A human rights lawyer, Khaled Ali launched a lawsuit against the government, forcing them to provide vaccination free of cost to all members of the public.
According to immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci, mutant strains of virus and limited vaccine distribution pose continuing risks and he said: "we have to get the entire world vaccinated, not just our own country."
Edward Bergmark and Arick Wierson are calling for an global vaccination effort and wrote that the wealthier nations' "me-first" mentality could ultimately backfire, because the spread of the virus in poorer countries would lead to more variants, against which current vaccines could be less effective.
On 10 March 2021, the United States, Britain, European Union nations and other WTO members, blocked a push by more than eighty developing countries to waive COVID‑19 vaccine patent rights in an effort to boost production of vaccines for poor nations.

===
Misinformation ===


===
Vaccine hesitancy ===
Some 10% of the public perceives vaccines as unsafe or unnecessary, refusing vaccination – a global health threat called vaccine hesitancy – which increases the risk of further viral spread that could lead to COVID‑19 outbreaks.
As of May 2020, estimates from two surveys were that 67% or 80% of people in the U.S. would accept a new vaccination against COVID‑19, with wide disparity by education level, employment status, ethnicity, and geography.
As of March 2021, 19% of US adults claim to have been vaccinated and 50% of US adults plan to get vaccinated.
In an effort to demonstrate the vaccine's safety, prominent politicians have received it on camera, with others pledging to do so.
===
Encouragement by public figures and celebrities ===
Many public figures and celebrities have publicly declared that they have been vaccinated against COVID‑19, and encouraged people to get vaccinated.
Many have made video recordings or otherwise documented their vaccination.
They do this partly to counteract vaccine hesitancy and COVID‑19 vaccine conspiracy theories.

====
Politicians and heads of state ====
Several heads of state and government ministers have released photographs of their vaccinations, encouraging others to be vaccinated including Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Zdravko Marić, Olivier Véran, US President Joe Biden, Former US Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama, Narendra Modi, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris.
Elizabeth II and Prince Philip announced they had the vaccine, breaking from protocol of keeping the British royal family's health private.
Pope Francis and Pope Emeritus Benedict both announced they had been vaccinated.

====
Musicians ====
Dolly Parton recorded herself getting vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine
she helped fund, she encouraged people to get vaccinated and created a new version of her song "Jolene" called "Vaccine".
Patti Smith, Yo-Yo Ma, Carole King, Tony Bennett, Mavis Staples, Brian Wilson, Joel Grey, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson, and Paul Stanley have all released photographs of them being vaccinated and encouraged others to do so.
Grey stated "I got the vaccine because I want to be safe.
We've lost so many people to COVID.
I've lost a few friends.
It's heartbreaking.
Frightening."

====
Actresses and actors ====
Amy Schumer, Rosario Dawson, Arsenio Hall, Danny Trejo, Mandy Patinkin, Samuel L. Jackson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Kate Mulgrew, Jeff Goldblum, Jane Fonda, Anthony Hopkins, Bette Midler, Kim Cattrall, Isabella Rossellini, Christie Brinkley, Cameran Eubanks, Hugh Bonneville, Alan Alda, David Harbour, Sean Penn, Amanda Kloots, Ian McKellen, Buzz Aldrin and Patrick Stewart have released photographs of themselves getting vaccinated and encouraging others to do the same.
Dame Judi Dench and Joan Collins announced they have been vaccinated.

====
TV personalities ====
Martha Stewart, Jonathan Van Ness, Al Roker and Dan Rather released photographs of themselves getting vaccinated and encouraged others to do the same.
Stephen Fry also shared a photograph of being vaccinated; he wrote, "It's a wonderful moment, but you feel that it's not only helpful for your own health, but you know that you're likely to be less contagious if you yourself happen to carry it ...
It's a symbol of being part of society, part of the group that we all want to protect each other and get this thing over and done with."
Sir David Attenborough announced that he has been vaccinated.

====
Athletes ====
Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar released photographs of themselves getting vaccinated and encouraged others to do the same; Abdul-Jabbar said, "We have to find new ways to keep each other safe."
====
Specific communities ====
Romesh Ranganathan, Meera Syal, Adil Ray, Sadiq Khan and others produced a video specifically encouraging ethnic minority communities in the UK to be vaccinated including addressing conspiracy theories stating "there is no scientific evidence to suggest it will work differently on people from ethnic minorities and that it does not include pork or any material of fetal or animal origin.
"Oprah
Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg have spoken about being vaccinated for COVID‑19 and encouraged black Americans to be vaccinated.
Stephanie Elam volunteered to be a trial volunteer stating "a large part of the reason why I wanted to volunteer for this COVID‑19 vaccine research – more Black people and more people of color need to be part of these trials
so more diverse populations can reap the benefits of this medical research."

M.I.T. Lecture 10:
Kizzmekia Corbett, Vaccines" on YouTube
Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus that infects cats worldwide.
It is a coronavirus of the species Alphacoronavirus 1 which includes canine coronavirus (CCoV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV).
It has two different forms: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that infects the intestines and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that causes the disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).

Feline coronavirus is typically shed in feces by healthy cats and transmitted by the fecal-oral route to other cats.

In environments with multiple cats, the transmission rate is much higher compared to single-cat environments.
The virus is insignificant until mutations cause the virus to be transformed from FECV to FIPV.
FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis, for which treatment is generally symptomatic and palliative only.
The drug GS-441524 shows promise as an antiviral treatment for FIP, but at the moment it's only available on the black market and still requires further research.

==
Prevalence ==
Feline coronavirus is found in cat populations around the world.
The only known exceptions are on the Falkland Islands and the Galapagos, where studies found no occurrences of FCoV antibodies in cats tested.

==
Virology ==


===
Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) ===
Feline enteric coronavirus is responsible for an infection of the mature gastrointestinal epithelial cells (see also enterocytes, brush border, microvilli, villi).
This intestinal infection has few outward signs, and is usually chronic.
The virus is excreted in the feces of the healthy carrier, and can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of feces or by PCR testing of rectal samples.
Cats living in groups can infect each other with different strains of the virus during visits to a communal litter tray.
Some cats are resistant to the virus and can avoid infection or even becoming carriers, while others may become FECV carriers.
Carriers may heal spontaneously, but acquired immunity may be short, and they may go on to reinfect, usually within a few weeks, if they are living in a group with healthy, but persistent, excretory carriers.
Some cats never heal, and the excretory phase remains permanently.
===
Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and Feline infectious peritonitis ===
The virus becomes feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) when random errors occur in the virus infecting an enterocyte, causing the virus to mutate from FECV to FIPV.
FIPV causes a lethal, incurable disease: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).

In their pre-domestication natural state, cats are solitary animals and do not share space (hunting areas, rest areas, defecation sites, etc.).
Domestic cats living in a group therefore have a much higher epidemiological risk of mutation.
After this mutation, the FCoV acquires a tropism for macrophages while losing intestinal tropism.
In a large group of cats, n, the epidemiological risk of mutation (E) is higher and expressed theoretically as: E = n2 −n.
A house hosting 2 cats therefore has risk of mutation E = 2.
When 4 kittens (6 cats in total) are born into this house, the risk increases from 2 to 30 (62−6).
Overcrowding increases the risk of mutation and conversion from FECV to FIPV, which constitutes a major risk factor for the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases.
FIP has been shown to develop in cats whose immunity is low; such as younger kittens, old cats, immunosuppression due to viral—FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) and/or FeLV (feline leukemia virus) and stress, including the stress of separation and adoption.
Infection of macrophages by FIPV is responsible for development of a fatal granulomatous vasculitis, or FIP (see granuloma).

Development of FIP depends on two factors:
virus mutation and low immunity where virus mutation depends on the rate of mutation of FECV to FIPV and the immune status depends on the age, the genetic pool and the stress level.
High immune status will be more effective at slowing down the virus.

==
Molecular biology ==
Two forms of feline coronavirus are found in nature: enteric (FECV) and FIP (FIPV).
There are also two different serotypes found with different antigens that produce unique antibodies.
FCoV serotype I (also called type I) is the most frequent.
Type I, that can be defined as 'FECV that could mutate to FIPV type I', is responsible for 80% of the infections.
Typically, serotype I FCoV cultures are difficult to perform, with few resulting studies.
FCoV serotype II (also called type II) is less frequent and is described as 'FECV type II that can mutate to FIPV type II.'
FCoV type II is a recombinant virus type I with spike genes (S protein) replacement from FCoV by the canine coronavirus (CCoV) spikes.
The type II cultures are generally easier to perform, which has resulted in an imbalance of experiments performed with many studies about type II (even though it is a far less common form).

More recent research points to a common ancestor between FCoV and CCoV.
This ancestor gradually evolved into FCoV I. An S protein from a yet-unknown virus was passed into the ancestor and gave rise to CCoV, whose S protein was again recombined into FCoV I to form FCoV II.
CCoV gradually evolved into TGEV.
===
FCoV type II ===


====
Virus fusion ====
Coronaviruses are covered with several types of "S proteins" (or E2) forming a crown of protein spikes on the surface of the virus.
Coronaviruses take their name from the observation of this crown by electron microscopy.
These spikes of Cov (group 1 and serotype II) are responsible for the infection power of the virus by binding the virus particle to a membrane receptor of the host cell—the Feline Amino peptidase N (fAPN).
====
The viral receptor: aminopeptidase N (APN) ====
fAPN (feline), hAPN (human) and pAPN (porcine) differ in some areas of N-glycosylation.
All strains of the coronavirus study group 1 (feline, porcine and human) can bind to the feline aminopeptidase N fapn but the human coronavirus can bind to the human APN (HAPN) but not to the porcine type receptor (pAPN) and the pig coronavirus can bind to the porcine APN (pAPN) but not the human type receptor (hAPN).
At the cellular level the glycosylation level of enterocytes APN is important for the binding of virus to the receptor.

====
Viral spikes ====
The FECV spikes have a high affinity for enterocytes fAPN, while the mutant FIPV spikes have a high affinity for the macrophages fAPN.
During the viral replication cycle, spikes proteins mature in the host cell Golgi complex with a high mannose glycosylation.
This spike manno-glycosylation stage is vital for the acquisition of coronavirus virility.

===
Molecular model of FCoV type I ===


====
The receptor ====
In 2007, it was well established that serotype
I did not work with the FCoV fAPN receptor.
The FCoV type I receptor still is unknown.

====
CoV receptor ====
The human CoV SARS binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE II.
The ACE II is also called L-SIGN
(liver/lymph node-specific intracellular adhesion molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin).
Coronaviruses bind to macrophages via the Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN) which is a trans-membrane protein encoded in humans by the CD209 gene.
ACE and DC-SIGN are two trans-membrane retrovirus receptors (mannose receptors) which can bind "the plant lectins C-type mannose binding
domain".
Aminopeptidase N has the same ability to interact with plant lectins C-type mannose-binding and also serves as a receptor for a retrovirus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE, aminopetidase A and aminopeptidase N have cascading actions in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which suggests a common phylogenetic origin between these molecules.
Some advanced studies have shown a high homology between the Aminopeptidase N and the Angiotensin-converting enzyme.
It is more than likely that the unknown FCoV serotype
I receptor is also a member of this receptor family and acts with mannose binding lectins.

===
Interactions between the viruses and sialic acid ===
Sialic acid is a component of the complex sugar glycocalix, which is the mucus protecting the gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosa.
It is an important facilitating fusion factor of any viruses to its host cell which has been very well studied for flu.

Extensive data also shows that processes using sialic acid are directly involved in the interaction with the receptor's lectins.
It has also been demonstrated that swine enteric coronavirus (group 1) fusion to the enterocyte is accomplished via binding to the APN in the presence of the sialic acid.
Feline coronavirus infections are therefore sialic acid dependent.
The Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)
S protein is 45% identical to FCoV type I spike.
An EM structure of it shows sialic acid binding sites.
The PEDV receptor is also unknown.

== Effects of breast milk on kittens ==
Kittens born from mothers carrying FECV are protected from infection during their first weeks of life until weaned by maternal antibodies.
It is recommended that the kittens are weaned early and segregated from their mother before they infect each other (at about 5 to 6 weeks).
Kittens with no outside contamination and that are deprived of contact with their mother during their first 2 months of life (an important immunological period) may be protected.

===
Antibodies ===
It is widely accepted that passive protection is passed on to kittens by immunoglobulins nursery (antibodies) provided by colostrum and the mother's milk.
However, several questions arise:

If this protection is only supported by maternal antibodies, why are these antibodies not protecting the mother herself?

If the kittens born to a mother's blood group B are removed from their mother for 24 hours (to avoid hemolytic disease of the newborn) and thus have no systemic passage of maternal antibodies, why is FCoV infection not more common in these kittens than others?

===
Colostrum ===
Other molecules from colostrum and cat milk, could also bear this coverage: lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, rich proline polypeptide—PRP and alpha-lactalbumine.
Lactoferrin has many properties that make it a very good candidate for this anti-coronavirus activity:
For FCoV group II, it binds to APN.

For SARS CoV, it binds to ACEs
It also binds to DC-SIGN of macrophages,
The lactoferrin anti-viral activity is sialic-acid–dependent.
The structures of the polypeptide chain and carbohydrate moieties of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) are well established.
bLF consists of a 689-amino acid polypeptide chain to which complex and high-mannose-type glycans are linked.
===
Other components ===
The colostrum and breast milk also contain:

Many oligosaccharides (glycan) which are known for their anti-viral properties which is thought to be primarily due to their inhibition of pathogen binding to host cell ligands.

Many maternal immune cells.

Many cytokines (interferon, etc.),
whose role by oro-mucosal route seems very important.

Sialic acid: during lactation, neutralizing oligo-saccharides binding sialic acid decreases when it binds increasingly to glycoproteins.
(
The APN is a glycoprotein.)
The anti-viral effect of lactoferrin is increased by the removal of sialic acid.

Mannan-binding lectins.

===
Other protective factors ===
Other assumptions may help to explain this resistance to FCoV infections by kittens.
In the first weeks of life, APN could be immature because highly manno-glycosylated.
The spikes of CoV could then not be bound.
Factors in breastmilk may inhibit the synthesis of fANP by enterocytes, as already described with fructose or sucrose.

Countries and territories in South Asia have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The first South Asian country to report a confirmed case was Nepal, which documented its first case on 23 January 2020, in a man who had returned from Wuhan on 9 January.
As of 2 July, at least one case of COVID-19 has been reported in every country in South Asia.
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Maldives have implemented lockdowns, Sri Lanka has responded with quarantine curfews while India and Nepal have declared a country-wide lockdown.
Countries have also instituted various levels of restrictions on international travel, some countries have completely sealed off their land borders and grounded most international flights.

India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were three South Asian countries that overtook China in terms of the number of coronavirus cases.
In the middle of May, India was the first South Asian country to overtake China in terms of the number of coronavirus cases.
On 4 June, Pakistan was the second South Asian country.
And on 13 June, Bangladesh was the third South Asian country.

In India, the number of recoveries exceeded the number of active cases on 10 June.
In Pakistan, the number of recoveries exceeded the number of active cases on 3 July.
And in Bangladesh, the number of recoveries exceeded the number of active cases on 12 July.

Governments are attempting to coordinate a response to the pandemic through the regional organization, SAARC, the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation.
India Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed a joint emergency fund to tackle the pandemic, and pledged to seed US$10 Million.
As of 11 April, Sri Lanka had contributed US$5 million to the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund and Pakistan $3 million, Bangladesh $1.5 million, Afghanistan and Nepal had given $1 million each, Maldives had given $200,000 while Bhutan $100,000.
==
Background ==
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
As of 29 March 2020, more than 708,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 190 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 33,500 deaths.
More than 150,000 people have since recovered.
The virus primarily spreads between people in a way similar to influenza, via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.

The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Symptoms are most often fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, but research is ongoing.
Efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive therapy.
Recommended preventive measures include handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people (particularly those who are unwell), and monitoring and self-isolation for fourteen days for people who suspect they are infected.
South Asia is one of the most densely populated regions and having low testing rates, and is considered highly vulnerable to any large scale outbreak of an infectious disease.

Coronavirus diseases are caused by viruses in the coronavirus subfamily.
Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
In humans and birds, the group of viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
As of 2020, 45 species are registered as coronaviruses, whilst 11 diseases have been identified, as listed below.

Coronaviruses are known for their shape resembling a stellar corona, such as that of the Sun visible during a total solar eclipse; corona is derived from the Latin word corōna, meaning 'garland, wreath, crown'.
It was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell, the founding fathers of coronavirus studies, and was first used in a Nature article in 1968, with approval by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses three years later.
The first coronavirus disease was discovered in the late 1920s, however, the most recent common ancestor of coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE.
Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s, through a variety of experiments in the United States and the United Kingdom.
A common origin in human coronaviruses are bats.

The COVID-19 pandemic began in Asia in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has spread widely through the continent.
As of 30 April 2020, at least one case of COVID-19 had been reported in every country in Asia except North Korea and Turkmenistan.

Excluding Russia (a transcontinental country), the Asian countries with the highest numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases are India, Turkey, Iran,  and Indonesia.
Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly Bhutan, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam has allowed them to fare comparatively well.
China was criticised for initially minimising the severity of the outbreak, but its wide-scale response has largely contained the disease since March 2020.As of mid-April 2021, the highest numbers of deaths are recorded in India, Iran, Indonesia, and Turkey, each with more than 35,000 deaths and about 320,000 deaths combined.

However, the death tolls in a number of countries are claimed to be significantly higher than those given in official figures.

On 22 March, Bangladesh declared a 10-day shut down effective from March 26 to April 4 to fight the spread of coronavirus.

Bangladesh on Wednesday reported the fifth death from the coronavirus though no new case of the infection came out in the last 24 hours as the country suspended all domestic flights, trains and public transport to fight the pandemic.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has confirmed that one more person has died of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Bangladesh, taking the number of deaths from the disease in the country to five, the Dhaka Tribune reported.
Bangladesh on Wednesday confirmed another death taking the death toll in the country to six while number of positive cases rose to 54.The nationwide lockdown has been extended till April 9 to curb the spread,
however Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina  on Tuesday said that offices and industries could resume work.
Health minister Zahid Malik said "another 300 ventilators are being imported.
There are about 700 ventilators across private hospitals".

===
Bhutan ===

By 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia.
The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as the patient, most had since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remained under quarantine at that time.

===
China ===
Sophisticated modelling of the outbreak suggests that the number of cases in mainland China would have been many times higher without interventions such as early detection, and isolation of the infected.

For the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak, China on Wednesday revealed the presence of 1,541 asymptomatic cases carrying the deadly novel coronavirus, raising concerns of a second wave of infections amid the relaxation of stringent measures in the country initiated to contain the deadly disease.
Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who carry the virus but do not show any symptoms and can cause sporadic clusters of infections.
In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said it would begin to release the data of asymptomatic patients.
A total of 1,541 asymptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 have been put under medical observation in China by the end of Monday, including 205 imported cases, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the NHC in a statement.

On 5 March, five people have tested positive for the new coronavirus COVID-19 in Georgia increasing the total number of people infected in the country to nine.
Head of the Georgian National Centre for Disease Control Amiran Gamkrelidze made the announcement at the recent news briefing following today.
He said, all of the five people belong to the same cluster who travelled together to Italy and returned to Georgia on Sunday.
On 7 March, three people have tested positive for the new coronavirus in Georgia increasing the total number of people infected individuals in the country to twelve.
Head of the Georgian National Centre for Disease Control Amiran Gamkrelidze said at a news briefing the following day that there is still no reason to panic.
One of the infected individuals is Gamkrelidze's son Nikoloz.
Gamkrelidze wrote on his Facebook page that he contracted the illness from a coworker, who has been tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.

Despite early reports of them testing negative for the virus, three of them were confirmed to be infected on 25 January.
On 16 February, the 15th infected patient involving a Chinese female national had fully recovered, becoming the 8th patient cured from the virus in Malaysia.
The following day, the first infected Malaysian also reportedly recovered, becoming the 9th cured.
In March 2020, several Southeast Asian countries experienced a significant rise in cases following an event held by Tablighi Jamaat at Jamek Mosque in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur, where many people are believed to have been infected.
By 17 March, almost two thirds of the 673 cases confirmed in Malaysia were related to the event.
More than 620 people, including those from other countries, who attended the event have tested positive, making it the largest-known centre of transmission in South East Asia.
In response to the rapid spread of cases, the Government introduced Movement Control Order lockdown restrictions on 18 March 2020, which helped to lower the infection and death rates.
The number of active cases peaked in April and slowly declined, leading to a relaxation of Movement Control Order lockdown restrictions over the next several months.
Since mid-September, an outbreak of cases in Sabah, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Penang and Kedah led to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases throughout the country.
By 18 November 2020, the total number of cases in Malaysia had exceeded the 50,000 mark.
A Sin Chew Daily editorial has attributed the rapid surge of cases to the failure of the public, businesses and their employees including migrant workers to practise health and social distancing procedures during the relaxation of Movement Control Order restrictions throughout 2020.By 24 December 2020, the total number of cases in Malaysia had exceeded the 100,000 mark.
By 14 January 2021, the total number of cases in Malaysia had reached the 150,000 mark.
By 29 January, the total number of cases had exceeded the 200,000 mark.

==
Prevention in other countries and territories ==


===
Turkmenistan ===
As of May 2020, there are no confirmed COVID-19 cases in Turkmenistan.
The government has censored use of the word "coronavirus" to control information about the virus, and experts suspect that it may be spreading in the country unreported.
Turkmenistan is a notoriously opaque state, purposefully isolated by an authoritarian regime led by Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, who has also been described as totalitarian.
Independent media in the country is virtually nonexistent so reporting about the current situation is difficult due to the inability to access and confirm reliable information from the country.

===
North Korea ===
There are no confirmed cases in North Korea.
North Korea was one of the first countries to close borders due to COVID-19.
In February, wearing face masks was obligatory and visiting public places such as restaurants was forbidden.

On 31 March 2020, the Asia Times reported that North Korea's measures against the pandemic seemed largely successful.
Edwin Salvador,
WHO's representative in North Korea, reported that as of 2 April, 709 people had been tested, with no confirmed cases, and 509 people were in quarantine.
On 23 April, US analyst website 38 North reported that North Korea's early and extensive response appeared to be successful in containing the virus.
Some anonymous reports claimed that North Korea was ineffective in curbing the disease, and that an order was enacted to 'spot and shoot', so as to hide the cases being reported nationwide.
Rumours also spread that first cases were reported when three soldiers were found infected, and that they were shot to death.

Coronavirus Updates in Asia
– Daily updated totals of the virus in Asia
The COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
Thailand was the first country to report a case outside China, on 13 January 2020.
As of 24 April 2021, the country has reported a cumulative total of 53,022 confirmed cases, with 129 deaths from the disease.

Thailand was relatively successful in containing the pandemic throughout most of 2020, but has been experiencing an uncontrolled resurgent outbreak since April 2021.
An initial wave of infections, mostly traced to nightlife venues and a boxing match in Bangkok, peaked on 22 March 2020 at 188 newly confirmed cases per day.
As preventive measures were implemented, the outbreak subsided by May, and the country reported almost no locally transmitted infections until December, when it saw a surge of infections primarily clustered around large migrant worker communities in Samut Sakhon Province.
The new outbreak spread to many provinces, with a maximum daily of 959 cases reported on 26 January 2021, before partially subsiding in February.
In April, however, a new wave of infections originated from Bangkok's Thong Lo–area nightlife venues and rapidly spread in Bangkok as well as throughout the country.
It was identified to be of the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant first reported from the United Kingdom, and by 14 April over a thousand cases per day were being identified, causing a shortage of hospital beds as government policy required admission of all confirmed cases.

The Thai government's response to the outbreak was initially based on surveillance and contact tracing, though it was late to implement clear quarantine measures.
In response to the first outbreak, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha declared a state of emergency, effective on 26 March, and the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) was established to coordinate the government's response, working in conjunction with the Department of Disease Control and issuing public communications through its spokesperson Taweesin Visanuyothin.
Lockdown measures were implemented in varying degrees throughout the country, with public venues and businesses ordered to close.
A curfew went into effect on 3 April, and all commercial international flights were suspended from 4 April.
The public has cooperated relatively well with health advisories, and the country's robust public health infrastructure has been credited as a contributing factor to its relatively successful initial response.
Easing of restrictions was gradually implemented from mid-May.
The curfew was lifted in July and academia reopened in August.
However, the state of emergency remained in effect.

With the subsequent outbreaks in December 2020 and April 2021, the government appeared reluctant to implement the same degree of restrictive measures for fear of further disruptions to the economy.
In December, it focused instead on mass testing of migrant workers and travel restrictions from affected provinces, while in April, it allowed the Songkran (Thai New Year) holidays to go ahead (though without water-splashing celebrations), despite having cancelled the holidays in 2020 when the caseload was lower.
Vaccinations began at the end of February 2021, mostly limited to healthcare workers and mainly using the CoronaVac vaccine imported from China's Sinovac Biotech.
The majority of the country's vaccine supply is planned to rely heavily on the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine through a manufacturing deal secured by the Siam Bioscience company, with first batches expected in June 2021.

The pandemic has heavily disrupted the country's economy, of which tourism is a significant sector.
The International Monetary Fund has predicted Thailand's GDP to shrink by 6.7 percent in 2020, a revision from a previous estimated 2.5% increase.
The government has borrowed and announced several assistance measures, including cash handouts to those affected and a 1.9 trillion-baht (US$60 billion) stimulus package, though few people have actually received it.
Dissatisfaction to its economic impact and government response contributed to the second wave of 2020 Thai protests starting from 18 July 2020.

==
Background ==
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

==
Timeline ==
On 13 January, the Ministry of Public Health announced the first confirmed case, a 61-year-old Chinese woman who is a resident of Wuhan.
She arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on 8 January, where she was detected using thermal surveillance and then hospitalised.
Thailand's second case occurred in a 74-year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Bangkok on a flight from Wuhan on 13 January.
Several more cases were detected in arrivals from China throughout January.

On 31 January, an additional five cases were reported, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed cases to 19.
One was a local taxi driver who had no records of travelling to China and was thus suspected to have been infected by a Chinese tourist he picked up, making this the first case of human-to-human virus transmission within the country.
The other cases were Chinese nationals.
The number of cases remained low throughout February, totaling to 40 confirmed by the end of the month.

On 1 March, MOPH reported the first confirmed death in Thailand.
The number of cases surged around mid-March, with 89 new cases reported on 21 March, the largest single-day rise since the virus reached the country.
The outbreak was traced to several transmission clusters, the largest of which occurred at a Muay Thai fight at the military-run Lumpinee Boxing Stadium on 6 March.
Confirmed cases rose to over a hundred per day over the following week, and public venues and businesses were ordered to close in Bangkok and several other provinces.
The abrupt closure of Bangkok businesses prompted tens of thousands of workers to travel to their hometowns.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha declared a state of emergency, effective on 26 March, and a curfew went into effect on 3 April.
All commercial international flights were suspended from 4 April, and lockdown measures were implemented in varying degrees throughout the country.

The rate of new cases gradually dropped throughout April, and by mid-May, locally transmitted infection rates had fallen to near-zero, and easing of restrictions was gradually implemented.
The curfew was lifted in July and academia began rereopening in August.

On 15 July, the national centre for COVID-19 has announced two new infected cases; an Egyptian soldier in Rayong Province, and a Sudanese diplomat's daughter in Asok neighbourhood of Bangkok.
Both of them were the government's exceptions for "VIP guests," not requiring to comply with several COVID-19 measures.
Many criticised the government's failure to contain the disease from those VIPs.
Even though there had been no new domestic cases since mid-May, on 21 August, the CCSA announced that it decided to extend the Emergency Degree until 30 September, claiming that it was necessary to use its power to prevent incoming aliens from overseas in many routes, and that Thai people' daily lives were not affected, since CCSI had already loosen its restriction on activities such as academia reopen.
International rights groups have criticized the emergency decree being employed to suppress free speech.
In September, a prison inmate who had not been abroad was Thailand's first locally transmitted case in 100 days.
Another domestic case was detected on 7 November, though neither cases were not traced to any further outbreaks.

In October, foreign tourists entered Thailand for the first time in seven months under the Special Tourist Visa program.
A total of 1,201 vistiors arrived in the month, compared to 3.07 million in the same month a year earlier.
A French tourist on Ko Samui in Surat Thani contracted the disease after passing the 14-day state quarantine.
She developed a fever 17 days after arriving in the country.
In November, the government extended the coronavirus emergency decree for the eighth time, approving a 45-day extension until 15 January 2021.Starting at the end of November, at least ten cases were detected in women who had illegally crossed the Myanmar border into Mae Sai District from Tachileik.
They made long-distance travels, including by bus and by air, and some attended large gatherings, prompting authorities to impose quarantine on people who may have come into close contact with them.
In mid-December, an outbreak occurred in Samut Sakhon, just southwest of Bangkok, increasing the country's total confirmed cases by at least 20%.
Cases in the province, which is the center of the country's fishing industry, primarily impacted migrant workers from Myanmar, a major source of labour in the seafood industry.
Over 1,300 cases were traced to a seafood market in Samut Sakhon, as cases were detected in 27 provinces.
Before the surge, Thailand had recorded about 4,300 COVID-19 cases and just 60 deaths, while Myanmar had registered about 117,000 cases.
The 576 cases reported on 20 December was Thailand's biggest daily increase and caused the nation's overall total to climb 13%.
A new cluster emerged in Rayong, linked to a gambling den.
On 28 December, a worker at the den died, Thailand's first COVID-19 death in nearly two months.
With the clusters starting to spread into Bangkok, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration announced that the city would close schools and daycare centres 4–17 January 2021.
Soon after, the Ministry of Education ordered all schools closed for the month of January.
A second, more serious wave would occur in April 2021 following the emergence of clusters in entertainment districts in and around Bangkok early in the month.
Thought to be exacerbated by the presence of the highly-transmittable B.1.1.7 variant in Thailand, the wave led to the largest surge in cases in the country to date, with sharp increases in daily cases over the course of the month.
On 14 April, Thailand detected 1,335 new cases, the first time the country reported a four-figure case count; by 24 April, the number of new cases peaked at 2,839.

International travel restrictions ===
The screening of passengers arriving from China is ongoing at six airports, beginning on 3 January:
Suvarnabhumi Airport, Don Mueang International Airport, Phuket International Airport, Chiang Mai International Airport and Krabi International Airport, with the addition of Chiang Rai International Airport since 24 January.
A number of suspected cases have been found to have other common respiratory conditions.
On 11 February, the Holland America Line-operated MS Westerdam was refused permission to dock at Laem Chabang port by the country's Marine Department.
The ship was previously denied entry to the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Guam due to similar fears.
On 13 February, two cruise ships, the MV Seabourn Ovation anchored at the Phuket Deep Sea Port and the Quantum of the Seas docked at Phuket's Patong pier.
Unlike the MS Westerdam, the two ships were allowed because both had planned to make their first stop in Thailand and would depart to Singapore afterwards.
The passengers on board were screened by public health officials before being given permission to step ashore.
On 17 February, a meeting between Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Public Health, AOT and the Immigration Bureau came to the conclusion to disallow entry of all foreigners from MS Westerdam to the country after an American woman tested positive for COVID-19 in Malaysia.
The number of passengers who entered Thailand before the ban was 95, 91 were transferred to connecting flights and had already left the country.
On 18 February, the health authorities had extended COVID-19 screening to cover visitors from Japan and Singapore.
Passengers from these countries were treated with the same method as passengers on flights from Mainland China.
The Ministry of Public Health also raised measures against COVID-19 to level 3 in preparation for a surge in transmission.
Every province must have at least one hospital capable of testing for COVID-19.
The Department of Medical Sciences is currently developing a virus test kit that will deliver a result in five minutes, which is planned to be available within two months.
On 21 February, the Ministry of Public Health announced a new screening criteria, with additional surveillance for visitors from Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and Taiwan.
People developing pneumonia due to unknown causes and living in eight provinces that were popular among Chinese tourists including Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Chon Buri, Krabi, Phuket, Prachuap Khiri Khan and Samut Prakan, would be automatically considered as COVID-19 suspected cases.
Further restrictions were announced on 19 March, requiring medical certification for international arrivals, and also health insurance for foreigners.
On 3 April, the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand ordered that there would be a ban on all passengers flights landing in Thailand from the morning of 4 April to the evening of the 6 April.

On 6 February 2020, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha warned that the stockpiling and price gouging of surgical masks and hand sanitisers could lead to legal consequences.
On 12 March 2020, health officials encouraged people to make face masks at home out of cloth, stating that cloth masks can prevent droplets bigger than one micron from spreading.
===
Lockdown, curfew, and inter-provincial travel ban ===
On 21 March, Bangkok City Hall authorities declared a wide-ranging shutdown of various businesses.
Bangkok Governor Aswin Kwanmuang disclosed after the City Hall meeting that the board had passed a resolution to close establishments under Section 35 of the Communicable Diseases Act B.E. 2558 (2015), effective for a period of 22 days from 22 March to 12 April 2020.
This was then extended from 12 April 2020 to 30 April 2020.
Only supermarkets, pharmacies, and takeaway restaurants will be allowed to stay open at the malls.
The government issued a curfew to take effect on 3 April between 10pm-4am in order to limit the spread.
The government has additionally issued a travel ban for all foreigners entering Thailand.
Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic.
The curfew was cut from 10–4 to 11–4, then 11-3 and officially ended on June 15.Early April 2021
, Bangkok's entertainment venues were ordered to be closed for 2 weeks.

Tracking application ===
Since May, the authority adopted a tracking application named "Thai Chana" (lit.
Thai wins) to track people who had entered an enclosed building, then would send a notice to anybody who were in there at the same time with a COVID-19 patient if later tested positive.
However, critics questioned its benefits and there were reports of spam.

===
Health education ===
Public education focused on self-monitoring for at-risk groups, practising hygiene (especially hand washing), and avoiding crowds (or wearing masks if avoidance was not possible).

===
Vaccine ===
In November 2020, the authorities ordered 26 million doses of vaccine from AstraZeneca, which reported 70% overall efficacy.
It requires 2 doses of vaccine per person, so the quantity ordered would only covered 13 million people.
Prayut cabinet later approved budget for ordering 35 million additional doses in January 2021.
Siam Bioscience, a company owned by King Vajiralongkorn, will received technological transfer for co-investment.
The authorities would also imported 2 million doses of vaccine from Sinovac, a Chinese company which Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand invested in, during February to April 2021.Likewise, Thai government also stepped up its attempt to produce its homeground vaccines amidst criticism, with "ChulaCov19" and set to put trial on May 2021.

In the January–March period, foreign tourist arrivals fell by 38% to 6.69 million; Chinese arrivals, the largest source of inbound tourists, plunged 60% to 1.25 million.
With its border closed and most international flights cancelled since 4 April, tourist arrivals and spending have both dropped to zero in April, compared to 3.2 million arrivals and $4.6 billion's worth of receipts in the same month last year.
Legend Siam, a theme park in Pattaya, will temporarily close from 3 March because of the lack of tourists during the spread of the virus.
The park management promised to hire all staff back when it eventually reopens.
On 16 March, the Ministry of Public Health announced that Songkran holidays and celebrations will be postponed until further notice as the number of cases continued to rise by 33 to 147.
The Songkran festival in Khaosan Road, Khon Kaen Province, Pattaya, Bang Saen Beach and Patong will not be held, according to each municipality's announcement.
The dates of the holiday are to be postponed as well.
Ko Pha-ngan District Chief Somchai Somwong made the decision to suspend a party on Rin Beach  to avoid the gathering of tourists, which could pose a risk of virus outbreak.
The party had originally been scheduled on the full-moon night of 8 March.
Brian Tan and Shreya Sodhani at Barclays argued that the need for quarantine would mean “the return of tourists could be relatively slow”.

===
Xenophobia and racism ===
A restaurant in Chiang Mai displayed a sign which read "
We apologize we are not accepting CHINESE customers.
Thank you" after a customer left the restaurant upon noticing a group of Chinese people inside.
The police demanded that the sign be taken down, but suggested that it could be rewritten in Chinese as "We ran out of food".
A similar sign was seen outside a restaurant in Ao Sane Beach in Phuket.
Health minister Anutin Charnvirakul made negative comments about "dirty" Westerners, saying they "never shower" and are more likely to spread the virus than Asians.
The post attracted negative reaction in Thailand and the UK and was quickly removed.
Mr. Charnvirakul claimed he was not responsible for it.
Online hate speech against Myanmar surged after the December outbreak among migrant workers in Samut Sakhon.
Prayut blamed the COVID-19 resurgence on illegal immigration.

===
Criticism of government response ===
The government has been criticised for various aspects of its response to the crisis, especially over its early handling of the pandemic, slow procurement of vaccines, and the April 2021 outbreak.

In early February 2020, in response to concerns over hoarding and price gouging of face masks, the government issued price controls and intervened in their distribution.
The move failed to prevent shortages among hospitals, and became a scandal over perceived corruption and siphoning of supplies.
Criticism was also aimed at the government's inconsistent policy over international travel and quarantine requirements, indecisiveness and slowness to act, and poor communication—many official announcements were made available to the public, only to be quickly retracted or contradicted by other government units, and later changed.
The abrupt closure of Bangkok businesses prompted tens of thousands of workers to travel to their hometowns, reflecting the failure among agencies to coordinate a unified response.

Possible spread to other countries ==
South Korea
On 4 February, a South Korean woman, who recently visited Bangkok on a vacation, was tested positive and confirmed as the 16th case of the countryGermany
On 4 March, Cologne city government announced five confirmed cases, including a woman who was previously on vacation in Thailand and is believed to have been infected there.
Australia
On 5 March, Queensland government confirmed that an 81-year-old man who has recently returned from Thailand tested positive and was admitted to Sunshine Coast University Hospital.
India
On 6 March, India reported its 31st confirmed case.
The patient is an Indian national who has a travel history from Thailand and Malaysia.

National responses and regulations ==


===
Measures ===
Following the confirmation of the first localized transmission on March 7, the DOH raised its alert to Code Red Sub-Level 1.
President Rodrigo Duterte later issued Proclamation
No.
922
on March 9, formally declaring a public health emergency, authorizing local government units to employ their local disaster risk reduction management funds.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on March 9 issued a directive ordering retailers should only allow the sale of two bottles of each type of disinfectant per person as a measure against hoarding.
In line with the public health emergency declaration, the department imposed a 60-day price freeze on basic commodities.
On March 16, the president signed Proclamation No.
929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the country for six months, bringing into effect the following:
price control of basic needs and commodities,
granting interest-free loans,
distribution of calamity funds,
authorization of importation and receipt of donations, and
hazard allowance for public health workers and government personnel in the fields of science and technology.
President Duterte has signed administrative orders providing daily hazard pay and additional special risk allowance to front line government officials and employees including health workers.
The office of Vice President Leni Robredo on its part raised funding for personal protective equipments.
The Department of Labor and Employment and the Department of Social Welfare and Development has started their own emergency cash subsidy programs.

===
Bayanihan to Heal as One Act ===
Following the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would "authorize the President to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to COVID-19 only for three months unless extended by Congress.
"
The act would allow Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost ₱275 billion Philippine pesos (~US$5.37 billion) from the estimated ₱438 billion (~US$8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic; enable him to "temporarily take over or direct the operations" of public utilities and privately owned health facilities and other necessary facilities "when the public interest so requires" for quarantine, the accommodation of health professionals, and the distribution and storage of medical relief; and "facilitate and streamline" the accreditation of testing kits.
In the House of Representatives of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as House Bill No.
6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros–Taguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district.
Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea addressed the session, stressing that the president needed "standby powers" to address the emergency.
Some representatives questioned the nature, usage, and necessity of the "standby powers", claiming its susceptibility to abuse and corruption.
In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No.
1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors.
Under the bill, Cayetano said that over 18 million Filipino households living below the poverty line would also receive financial incentives of around ₱5,000–8,000
(~US$97.45–155.92) per month for two months.
Senators amended their version of the bill to include financial compensation of around ₱100,000 ($1,965.33) to be given by PhilHealth to health professionals who contracted the virus, as well as the provision of around ₱1 million-worth (~US$19,653.27) of financial aid to their families.
Both versions of the bill reportedly removed the usage of the term "emergency powers", replacing it with "authority".
It also removed the term "take over of public utilities and private businesses", limiting President Duterte's abilities at most to "direct the operations" of such enterprises.
The House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate.
Duterte signed the bill into law the following day.

===
Lockdowns ===
On March 12, 2020, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering the entirety of Metro Manila that was later put into place on March 15.
The lockdown was further expanded on March 16, when President Duterte imposed an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) throughout the entire island of Luzon and its associated islands.
This was effectively a total lockdown, which had restricted travel and transportation, imposed strict home quarantine among all households, and closed all non-essential private establishments within the island group.
This ECQ was extended and reimposed multiple times during the pandemic.
Similarly, local governments outside Luzon and Metro Manila have imposed various measures to limit the spread of the virus in their communities.
By mid-2020, most of the Philippines were placed in a more relaxed and centralized general community quarantine (GCQ), although certain parts of the country remained with stricter measures.
Several clusters of the disease have led to localized lockdowns.

===
Cash aid ===


====
Social amelioration program ====
The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) is the agency responsible for the implementation of the national government's social amelioration program (SAP), an emergency cash subsidy meant for indigent families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and relevant quarantine measures.
As of April 14, 2020, around ₱57.8 billionhave been released by the social welfare department to the country's 103 local government units (LGUs).
The agency targets to make 18 million low-income households as beneficiaries of the program.
Households with a family income of less than ₱10 thousand monthly income were given priority.
The DSWD has devolved the distribution of the cash subsidy to the LGUS though the agency continues to provide support to the LGUs' efforts including "on-the-spot" validation of beneficiaries.
By May 17, the DSWD had reached 95 percent of its target, providing aid to 17.1 million beneficiary households with ₱96.7 billion worth of cash subsidy distributed.
The DSWD issued multiple warnings regarding misinformation on the cash aid program coming from unsanctioned Facebook pages.
For the second tranche of the SAP, the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte changed the responsibility of distributing cash aid from the local government units to the military and police amid complaints of slow delivery and misuse of funds meant for certain areas.

====
Universal healthcare ====
The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) announced that it would provide ₱30-billion
($581-million) worth of advance payment to its accredited health facilities for health care providers to obtain the liquid capital required to efficiently respond to the crisis.
PhilHealth also subsided some of its policies on its members; it waived the 45-day coverage and single period of confinement policies while extending payment deadlines until the end of April and the failing period of claims from 60 days to at least 120 days.
Also, PhilHealth announced that PUIs quarantined in its accredited facilities are entitled to a ₱14,000 ($270) health package, while those who tested positive for COVID-19 are entitled to a ₱32,000 ($580) beneficiary package.

====
Frontline workers compensation ====
On March 23, President Duterte signed Administrative Order No.
26, granting that front line government officials and employees receive a daily hazard pay of ₱500
($9.87).
On April 6, President Duterte signed Administrative Order No.
28, granting the payment of a special risk allowance to public health workers in addition to their hazard pay.
According to the order, public health workers attending to COVID-19 patients, PUMs, and PUIs will receive at most a quarter of their basic pay.

====
Other measures ====
The Presidential Security Group (PSG) have implemented a "no-touch" policy during meetings by President Duterte with politicians, reporters, and visitors.
Several government officials announced that they would donate portions of their salaries to help fund government initiatives responding to the pandemic.
President Duterte said that he would donate a month of his salary, which amounts to ₱400,000, to the Office of Civil Defense.
Some senators and around 200 members of the House of Representatives would also donate their salaries for May, while most Cabinet members would donate at most 75 percent of their salaries.
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) announced it would initiate a cash assistance program
worth ₱2 billion ($39 million) for workers in both the formal and informal sectors across the country affected by government-imposed quarantines.
As of March 31, the department reported that at least 25,428 formal sectors and 5,220 informal sector workers were given cash assistance of ₱5,000
($98) each.
===
Medical supply ===
The office of Vice President Leni Robredo raised about ₱28.8 million ($564,551) to purchase 64,367 sets of PPE and donate it to front line health professionals across the country.
The first batch consisted of 7,350 PPEs that were donated to 490 professionals in eight hospitals in Manila and Quezon City with COVID-19 cases.
By March 24, Robredo's office had delivered 23,475 sets of PPE to 62 medical facilities and communities across Metro Manila, La Union, and Quezon.
Robredo also partnered with fashion designer Mich Dulce to mass-produce PPEs that utilize locally sourced Taffeta fabric; the Vice President pledged to help donate the PPEs to medical professionals across the country.

===
Mass testing ===
As part of the national government's efforts to conduct mass testing, it began setting up "mega swabbing centers" in May 2020 by re-purposing various existing facilities.
The first of such facility opened at the Palacio de Manila along Roxas Boulevard on May 5.
These facilities uses reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits.
The facilities are meant to prioritize the testing of around 25,000 Overseas Filipino Worker repatriates.
Two more facilities opened: at the Enderun Colleges in Taguig and the Mall of Asia Arena in PasayA fourth facility is set to be opened at the Philippine Arena which will test residents of Bulacan and Metro Manila.
All swab samples collected from the testing centers will be processed by the Philippine Red Cross.
As of September 2020, the Philippine Government has reported that over 3 million people have been tested.

===
Travel restrictions ===

Ruffy Biazon, a member of the House of Representatives from Muntinlupa, called on the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) on January 22 to suspend flights from Wuhan to the Philippines.
Royal Air Charter Service operates direct flights from Wuhan to Kalibo.
By then, Philippine travel visas under the "visa-upon-arrival" (VUA) program were denied to tourists from Wuhan.
On January 24, the Philippine government deported 135 individuals from Wuhan who arrived in the country through the Kalibo International Airport.
There were calls for a wider temporary ban on people entering the country from anywhere in China.
This was supported by Senators Ralph Recto, Bong Go, Risa Hontiveros, and Francis Pangilinan
however, the DOH and the Office of the President find no urgent need for such a measure.
On January 31, a travel ban on all Chinese nationals from Hubei and other affected areas in China was imposed.
The VUA program for Chinese tourists and businessmen was also suspended.
On February 2, a ban was introduced on all foreign travelers who visited China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the past 14 days; Philippine citizens and holders of permanent resident visas were allowed in the country but subjected to a mandatory 14-day quarantine.
The Philippine government also ordered a ban on travel to China, Hong Kong, and Macau until further notice.
On February 10, the ban was further extended to include Taiwan but was lifted on February 15.
On February 14, the DOH announced that a risk assessment carried out to determine if Singapore would be placed under a travel ban.
Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced that he would not fully support any official travel bans to Singapore.
On February 26, travel to South Korea was banned, except for permanent residents, Filipino leaving for study, and Overseas Filipino Workers returning for work.
The Philippine Ports Authority had barred disembarkation by crew or passengers from vessels that have recently visited China and suspended the visitation privileges of relatives of Filipino seafarers and boarding privileges of non-government organizations providing emotional and spiritual support to seafarers.

On March 19, Locsin announced that the Philippine government would deny the entry of all foreign nationals, effective that day "until further notice".
All Philippine embassies and consulates would suspend the issuing of its visas to all foreign nationals and invalidate all existing ones.
However, Locsin clarified that visas that had already been issued to families of Filipino nationals would remain valid.
On March 22, the Department of Transportation ordered a travel ban to all foreign nationals, with the exception of returning or repatriated overseas Filipinos, foreign spouses of Filipino citizens (and their children), and workers for international organizations and non-governmental organizations accredited in the country.
The Philippines suspended all inbound commercial flight to its international airports for a week starting May 3.
From May 11 to June 10, new regulations are imposed on inbound flights to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport with charter flights allowed only on Mondays and Thursdays and commercial flights allowed in all the other five days.
All flights require prior clearance from the DFA and CAAP.

===
Repatriation ===
The Philippine national government has repatriated citizens from various COVID-19 affected countries and cruise ships.
As of April 13, at least 13,000 Overseas Filipino Workers have been repatriated according to the DFA.
Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier, has volunteered several repatriation flights as early as March.
The first of such efforts by the government involved repatriating Filipino nationals in Hubei, China.
The government began the repatriation process on January 18.
Upon arrival in the Philippines, individuals underwent mandatory quarantine for 14 days.
The Athlete's Village at the New Clark City Sports Hub which also has a clinic run by the Philippine General Hospital was chosen as the quarantine site for repatriated Filipinos and New Clark City was locked down on February 6 in preparation for the arrival of the repatriated.

===
Military and police ===
Both the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) have been deployed by the national government as front liners in addressing the pandemic.
PNP Chief Archie Gamboa tasked his agency to increase their visibility in various communities and to arrest individuals and groups "without warning" involved in activities that violate quarantine protocols on physical distancing and mass gatherings.
Border checkpoints maintained by the AFP, PNP, and the Philippine Coast Guard were installed in areas with community quarantine to control the traffic of people and goods and ultimately contain the spread of the virus across regions during the pandemic.
The PNP have also been tasked to arrest individuals who hoard essential goods in stores and to report firms that fail to comply with the directives of the DTI by manipulating the prices of such goods during the pandemic.
The Philippine Air Force and Philippine Navy have utilized their aircraft and vessels for the delivery of personal protective equipment and medical supplies, as well as the transportation of health personnel, to various locations around the country.
On March 24, the PNP launched a task force in collaboration with the Department of Information and Communications Technology to search for and apprehend peddlers of misinformation and fake news related to the pandemic, in compliance with the Cybercrime Prevention Act and the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.
Both laws penalize fake news peddlers for a jail time of 12 years maximum or a fine of up to ₱1 million ($19,770).Since April 15, PNP personnel have donated portions of their salaries to the Department of Finance to help sustain the national government's efforts in addressing the pandemic.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III reported that, as of May 6, the PNP has raised over ₱228.45 million ($4.5 million) worth of cash donations.
Following the rise in violations by the public to adhere to quarantine protocols, President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened for both the military and the police to "take over" in enforcing the social distancing and curfew guidelines in a similar fashion to martial law.
On April 20, a memo from the AFP regarding stricter quarantine protocols was leaked.
The memo was later confirmed.
Since April 20, the AFP has deployed its field kitchens in various locations around the country to provide free meals for homeless people, stranded workers and students, informal settlers, and families in "depressed communities" affected by the quarantine impositions.
In July 2020, the Philippine government announced that the PNP will conduct house-to-house searches for people who might have been infected with COVID-19 and then forcibly relocate them to government-run isolation facilities, which according to Human Rights Watch, is a drug war tactic that will violate the rights of citizens.

===
Quarantine and isolation ===
The Department of Public Works and Highways and the Bases Conversion and Development Authority set up quarantine and isolation centers by repurposing facilities as "We Heal As One Centers".
As of May 28, 2020, 10 such facilities had been completed.

==
Controversies and criticisms ==
The government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines has received criticism from social media platforms and were also met with physical protests.

NBI investigation of politicians who violated quarantine protocols ===


====
Mayor Vico Sotto ====
After the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and before the enactment of the Bayanihan law, Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto temporarily allowed limited operation of the city's tricycles to serve health care workers, government personnel and patients, despite the national government's ban on the operation of public transportation.
Sotto said that banning all tricycles in the city would bring more risk to the city's health situation.
After he aired the views and experiences of the local government of Pasig, Sotto complied with the inclusion of tricycles in the public transportation ban.
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), through its Deputy Director Ferdinand Lavin, confirmed on April 1, 2020 that NBI sent an invitation letter to Sotto for violation of Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.
Lavin said that Sotto was scheduled to appear at the bureau on April 7, 2020 at 10 am.
Sotto responded by saying that he had already complied with the national government's order to stop tricycle operations prior to the implementation of the law.
Senate President Tito Sotto, an uncle of the mayor, criticized the move in a tweet, stating "NBI will be well advised to be cautious in their interpretation of the law I principally authored.
Any so-called violation of RA 11469 can't be retroactive!".
Liberal Party president and Senator Francis Pangilinan also questioned the NBI's actions, stating the unconstitutionality of criminalizing an act committed before the law was passed.

Social media users criticized the NBI for allegedly singling out the mayor, pointing out that Senator Koko Pimentel violated quarantine protocols a few days before but was given consideration by the government.

====
Koko Pimentel ====
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) spokesperson Deputy Director Ferdinand Lavin said that the bureau was also investigating Senator Aquilino Pimentel III for alleged violation of the Bayanihan Heal as One Act.
Director Eric Distor of the NBI confirmed that Pimentel would also be invited to the bureau to explain.
He would be summoned when his self-quarantine ended.
Pimentel had undergone testing for COVID-19 and was informed that he was positive for the disease while he was at the Makati Medical Center, accompanying his pregnant wife who was scheduled to give birth.
The results came out on March 25 and Pimentel was tested positive for COVID-19, making the second Senator to do so after Juan Miguel Zubiri.

On April 1, 2020, the authorities arrested 20 protesters who flocked along Edsa in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa in Quezon City for staging a rally without a permit.
About 150 protesters called to local government for aid amid the enhance community quarantine in Luzon.
The NBI, however, did not comment what violations the organizers may be facing.
The rally leads the authorities to disperse the protesters.
The arrest was condemned by Kadamay Chairperson Bea Arellano.

==== Shooting of Winston Ragos ====
Winston Ragos was a Philippine Army veteran who served in the Battle of Marawi in 2017.
He was shot dead by the police at a checkpoint while the country is under enhanced community quarantine for attempting to pull a gun.
Ragos was brought to Commonwealth Hospital but was declared dead on arrival.
Witnesses say he did not bring a gun and his mother claimed her son was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following his tour of duty.
On April 21, 2020, at 2:30 p.m., Police Master Sergeant Daniel Florendo, Jr. and some police trainees from the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group were manning a control point in Maligaya Drive, Brgy.
Pasong Putik, Quezon City.
In a CCTV footage, Ragos approached the policemen and started shouting due to their claim of him violating quarantine protocols.
The police officers asked Ragos to go home and he allegedly attempted to pull out a .38 caliber hand gun from his sling bag prompting Florendo to shoot Ragos.
Florendo shot Ragos twice, causing him to stagger.
Ragos stood up, before falling to the ground.
Ragos was brought to Commonwealth Hospital and was declared dead at 5:57 p.m.
Witnesses claimed the victim did not have a gun inside his bag.
Upon checking, police found .38 caliber, I.Ds and quarantine pass.
For the Philippine National Police (PNP), it was a "judgment call" for Florendo.
His death during the quarantine period led to heavy criticism of the PNP.
Florendo surrendered to authorities and yielded his service firearm.
Senator Risa Hontiveros asked the human rights sector and the police to investigate his death and said in a Facebook post that law enforcement agencies do not have an excuse for brutality and violence towards persons with mental illness and the powerless.
A hashtag named #JusticeForWinstonRagos trended online.
The Quezon City government released a statement online on their stance as the Quezon City Police Department is undertaking a thorough investigation.
The Makabayan bloc of the House of Representatives has condemned the shooting saying the incident “highlights the draconian handling” of the coronavirus crisis.
Philippine Army conferred Military honors to the former soldier Corporal Winston Ragos.
Philippine Army said it coordinated with Ragos's mother to extend honors to the soldier and proceed with funeral and burial arrangements at the Libingan ng mga Bayani April 26, 2020

====
Debold Sinas birthday party controversy ====
Despite a ban on mass gatherings amidst enhanced community quarantine, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) personnel celebrated the birthday of their chief Maj.
Gen. Debold Sinas on May 8, 2020 at Camp Bagong Diwa.
The birthday celebration was met with criticism on social media.
The pictures of Sinas birthday party were circulated on the internet on May 13 showing the attendees appearing to disregard the rules on social distancing and mass gatherings.
The Philippine National Police (PNP)
chief Gen. Archie Gamboa ordered an investigation over Sinas's birthday party; however Gamboa defended Sinas, saying that he "do not think this is a violation."
Responding to the criticism, Sinas issued an apology over the event, saying that he did not intend to disobey the protocols related to the enhanced community quarantine.
He also added that some of the photos were manipulated.
The NCRPO public information office clarified that some of the photos were taken in December 2019, and coincidentally, Sinas was wearing the same T-shirt on that day.
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)
Secretary Eduardo Año said that Sinas's birthday party "cannot be called a birthday party" but "that is uncalled for."
The president added that he needs police officers like Sinas to enforce the law in Metro Manila.
On May 15, 2020, the PNP filed criminal charges against Sinas and 18 other officers who attended his birthday for violating quarantine guidelines.
PNP Chief Gamboa said that, despite the controversy, Sinas may not be relieved from his post.
Before the event, Sinas served as the police director in Cebu City from July 2018 to October 2019 before he was appointed as National Capital Region Chief Police Officer.
Despite the controversy, President Duterte assured that Sinas will not be removed from his post and argued that Sinas is an honest and a good officer.
Duterte's statement was met with condemnation from human rights groups.

"Non-essential" lugaw delivery viral video ====
The dish made news nationally in March 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, after a video surfaced on social media showing a delivery rider affiliated with GrabFood being denied access in Muzon, San Jose del Monte.
He was to deliver lugaw to a customer in the barangay.
A female barangay official claimed that the rider violated the curfew rules amid the reimplementation of the enhanced community quarantine in the Greater Manila Area, and alleged that lugaw was "not essential".
The incident went viral.
Responding to the incident, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque reiterated that food delivery services should remain unhampered even during the time of the community quarantine.
He said that food items, like lugaw, should be considered essential goods.
Initially the official stood by her decision, saying their curfew rules only permitted the operation of food businesses from 5 in the morning to 6 in the afternoon, but later apologized for the incident and said she never meant to offend anyone.
She added that she might have been exhausted which led her use of wrong words.
The barangay also apologized over the incident and vowed such incident will not occur again.

Vaccine controversies ===


====
Military and PSG vaccination controversy ====
In 2020, members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), Cabinet officials, a senator, and the Special Envoy for Public Diplomacy to China received vaccines without clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Department of Health (DOH).Duterte said in December 2020 that some members of the military received COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer Sinopharm despite the vaccine not yet officially approved by the country's health authorities.
A few days later, it was reported that some members of the PSG had also received vaccines from an unknown manufacturer.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that the vaccine used by the security group were smuggled.
Brig.
Gen. Jesus Durante III said that members of the PSG were vaccinated as early as September 2020 and Duterte said that PSG personnel administered the vaccines themselves.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque urged the public to "just accept" that some soldiers have received COVID-19 vaccines.
On December 28, the Armed Forces of the Philippines said that the PSG members were the first ones to be vaccinated to "protect" Duterte.
On December 29, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo said that the DOH and the FDA were not consulted over the inoculation of soldiers and other government officials.
On December 30, Durante said that he will take "full responsibility" for the vaccine administered to the PSG.In 2021, criminal investigations and hearings were ordered by the National Bureau of Investigation, the FDA, and the Philippine Senate over alleged irregularities with the vaccinations.

On January 4, 2021, Duterte ordered the PSG to either not attend any congressional meeting regarding the unauthorized vaccination or stay quiet during such a hearing, contradicting the Presidential Spokesperson who said that the PSG will submit to any investigation.
On January 5, despite Duterte's threat of a potential "crisis" if senators questioned his military bodyguards about their vaccination, the Senate opened the investigation for the unauthorized use of COVID-19 vaccines.
On January 6, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said that he found nothing wrong with giving vaccines to PSG members, stating that they are considered frontliners.

====
Vaccination priority list violations
====
Actor Mark Anthony Fernandez was given the AstraZeneca vaccine in Parañaque on March 22, 2021, despite not being on the priority list – which includes healthcare workers, followed by senior citizens, and followed by people with comorbidities.
Parañaque City Mayor Edwin Olivarez defended the vaccination of Fernandez, stating that the city was done inoculating healthcare workers and that Fernandez has comorbidities, making him eligible to be included on the city's "quick substitution list" for vaccination.
The actor said that he received the vaccine but did not violate protocol, explaining that he was placed on the substitution list after several health workers failed to show up.
President Duterte implied that Fernandez should be investigated when he ordered the DOH to look into the vaccination of an actor whom he did not identify.
On March 24, Duterte named in his public address nine different mayors who jumped the vaccination priority line.

Related to community pantries ===
The community pantries started on April 14, 2021, in the Loyola Heights barangay of Quezon City in the Philippines.
It is a trend utilizing a similar concept emerged across the country, in which small carts carrying essential items are parked along sidewalks for locals to get items for free.
A community pantry was first established on Maginhawa Street in Quezon City by 26-year-old organizer Ana Patricia Non on April 14, 2021.
Community pantries later spread across the country, many organized by people who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, stocking various items and food products.
However, amid reports of red-tagging by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) and alleged profiling by police, Ana Patricia Non, fearing for her safety, temporarily ceased operations of her pantry.
Non posted screenshots of Facebook posts made by Quezon City Police Department and NTF-ELCAC that claimed the pantries "are being used by communist groups for their propaganda."
She appealed to Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte for help.
NTF-ELCAC spokesperson Lt.
General Antonio Parlade Jr. explained that the task force was “checking the background” of the organizers who were working to provide food for people affected by the pandemic.
The Philippine National Police denied the allegations of profiling the organizers.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said that checking the profiles of pantry organizers could violate the Data Privacy Law.

Allegations of hospital not counting COVID-19 deaths ====
On April 11, 2020, GMA News anchor
Arnold Clavio alleged through his social media account that one hospital in Metro Manila has not counted the deaths of COVID-19.
Clavio said that these information were coming from one of the frontliners he did not name and he also included the screenshots of the conversation of the frontliner.
The frontliner alleged that, due to lack of body bags, the bodies were spread out in the hospital hallway.
The DOH responded to the allegations, clarifying that the agency has never issued any order to stop the census of COVID-19 deaths.
The DOH added that they have spoken to Clavio for the matter and the agency is investigating the allegations.
The East Avenue Medical Center also denied the claims that they are lacking body bags for the patients who died.

==== #OustDuterte ====
The hashtag #OustDuterte and #OustDuterteNow trended on social media one day after the beginning of pandemic in the Philippines.
Netizens accused the government of failing to take immediate action by not imposing a ban on all incoming flights from China.
On April 2, 2020, the hashtag trended again on Twitter, which garnered 327,000 tweets following Duterte's remarks of ordering to "shoot" the violators of COVID-19 quarantine protocol during his speech on April 1.
His remarks were widely condemned by Twitter users, including local celebrities.

====
#DutertePalpak ====
On March 15, 2021, after a year of the declaration of the community quarantine in Metro Manila, #DutertePalpak went trending on social media.
Netizens blamed the government for the resurgence of cases and its lack of proper response to the pandemic but Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that the new variants of the virus caused the resurgence.
A day after the hashtag went trending, People's Television Network, a state-run channel, accidentally placed the hashtag on their social media post regarding the provision of masks.

====
Duterte's absence on public addresses ====
Duterte's cancellation of his weekly national address triggered the hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo (#WhereisthePresident) on April 7, 2021, which netizens aired their speculations over president's health and his whereabouts.
On the same day, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that Duterte would not deliver public address due to rising number of COVID-19 cases.
On April 8, Senator Bong Go posted a picture of Duterte seated on a table alongside with various documents.
Duterte gave his last address on March 29.
On April 10, Go posted another photo of Duterte riding a motorcycle and jogging at night.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was confirmed to have reached Myanmar on 23 March 2020.
On 31 March 2020, the Committee for Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), headed by First Vice President Myint Swe and made up of members from the various union ministries, was formed by President Win Myint to combat the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Although the government rapidly implemented containment measures and public health responses, the country had experienced one of the most severe COVID-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia by late 2020.
The UN raised concerns about Myanmar's vulnerability to the pandemic due to its weak healthcare infrastructure following poor investment over six decades of military rule, as well as ongoing internal conflict.
The pandemic has greatly disrupted the country's economy and Myanmar's GDP shrank by 5% in 2020.
The 2021 coup d'état and subsequent protests and civil disobedience movement, some of which were led by healthcare workers, caused severe disruptions to the country's public health response and deepened its recession.
The country's COVID-19 testing system and vaccination deployment are thought to have collapsed in February 2021.

Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases and historical data by Johns Hopkins University
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020 and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila.
On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease.
After over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7, 2020.
Since then, the virus has spread with at least one case being recorded in the country's 81 provinces.
Socio-economic status has been associated with the prevalence of COVID-19 cases across the country.
Lockdowns, or community quarantines, have been imposed throughout the country since March 15, 2020 as a measure to limit the spread of the virus.
The largest of these measures was the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon.
As of April 29, 2021, the Philippines has reported 1,028,738 cases of the disease.
Out of these cases, 942,239 recoveries and 17,145 deaths have been recorded.
In terms of confirmed COVID-19 cases, it has the 2nd highest in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia), ranks 7th in Asia, and 26th in the world.
The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on April 2, 2021, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 15,310 new cases.
The Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country.
COVID-19 tests had to be taken outside the country due to the lack of testing kits.
This also has led to a controversy that involved several government officials who were reported to have undergone COVID-19 tests without qualifying to the DOH's triage algorithm.
By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the country's first subnational laboratory.
Several laboratories have been accredited by the DOH since then.
As of April 25, the country has 249 subnational laboratories capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has conducted a total of 11,581,020 tests from more than 10,882,337 unique individuals.

Timeline ==


===
January to February 2020 ===
The Philippines reported its first suspected case of COVID-19 in January 2020.
It involved a 5-year-old boy in Cebu, who arrived in the country on January 12 with his mother.
At that time, the Philippines had no capability to conduct COVID-19 tests.
The boy tested positive for "non-specific pancoronavirus assay" in the RITM.
Samples from the boy were also sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia to determine the specific coronavirus strain.
The boy tested negative for COVID-19 but several suspected cases were already reported in various parts of the country.
The RITM developed capability to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-19 cases.
It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30.The first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed on the same day.
The diagnosed patient was a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 21.
She was admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25 after she sought a consultation due to a mild cough.
At the time of the confirmation announcement, the Chinese woman was already asymptomatic.
The second case was confirmed on February 2, a 44-year-old Chinese male who was the companion of the first case.
His death on February 1 was the first recorded outside China.
He suffered from coinfection with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
On February 5, the DOH confirmed a third case in a 60-year-old Chinese woman who flew into Cebu City from Hong Kong on January 20 before she traveled to Bohol where she consulted a doctor at a private hospital on January 22, due to fever and rhinitis.
Samples taken from the patient on January 24 returned a negative result, but the DOH was notified on February 3 that samples taken from the patient on January 23 tested positive for the virus.
The patient upon recovery on January 31 was allowed to go home to China.

===
March 2020 ===
After a month of reporting no new cases, on March 6, the DOH announced two cases consisting of two Filipinos.
One is a 48-year-old man with a travel history to Japan, returning on February 25 and reported symptoms on March 3.
The other is a 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on February 25 and was admitted to a hospital on March 1 when he experienced pneumonia.
He had last visited a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan.
The DOH confirmed that the fifth case had no travel history outside the Philippines and is, therefore, the first case of local transmission.
A sixth case was later confirmed, that of a 59-year-old woman who is the wife of the fifth case.
Since then, the Department of Health recorded a continuous increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country.
Cases abroad involving foreigners with travel history in the Philippines were reported in early March 2020.
The first three recorded cases involving an Australian, a Japanese, and a Taiwanese national had a history of visiting the Philippines in February 2020.
Though it was unconfirmed whether or not they had contracted the virus while in the Philippines, speculations arose on undetected local transmissions in the country due to prior confirmation of the Philippines' first case of local transmission.
Retrospective studies have been made to determine the strain of virus responsible for causing the community outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines since March 2020.
In May 2020, Edsel Salvaña, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and member of the IATF-EID, said that the strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in the country that started in March 2020 is closely related to the strain affecting India at the time.
The virus strain's family tree is said by Salvaña to have appeared in China and Australia.
In a July 2020 webinar led by Cynthia Saloma, Executive Director of the UP Philippine Genome Center two hypotheses was presented regarding the source of the March 2020 outbreak in the Philippines.
Genetic sequence analysis of samples collected from Philippine General Hospital patients from March 22–28 suggest that there are at least two sources of viral transmission in the Philippines; China, mainly from Shanghai and from Japan specifically through repatriated Filipino seafarers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Several measures were imposed to mitigate the spread of the disease in the country, including bans on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and South Korea.
On March 7, 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) raised its "Code Red Sub-Level 1," with a recommendation to the President of the Philippines to impose a "public health emergency" authorizing the DOH to mobilize resources for the procurement of safety gear and the imposition of preventive quarantine measures.
On March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No.
922, declaring the country under a state of public health emergency.
On March 12, President Duterte declared "Code Red Sub-Level 2," issuing a partial lockdown on Metro Manila to prevent a nationwide spread of COVID-19.
The lockdowns were expanded on March 16, placing the entirety of Luzon under an "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ).
Other local governments outside Luzon followed in implementing similar lockdowns.
On March 17, President Duterte issued Proclamation No.
929, declaring the Philippines under a state of calamity for a tentative period of six months.
Additional facilities started to conduct confirmatory testing.
On March 20, four facilities, namely the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Benguet, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila (where the first case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the RITM.
Other facilities began operations as well in the following days.
On March 25, the President signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which gave him additional powers to handle the outbreak.

===
April to May 2020 ===
By April, COVID-19 had spread to all 17 regions of the Philippines, with the confirmation of a case in April 6 of a patient confined at a hospital in Surigao City who had been in the Caraga region since March 12 after traveling from Manila.
President Duterte on April 7 accepted the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to extend the ECQ in Luzon until April 30.On April 17
, it was reported that the country had been able to bring down the viral disease' reproduction number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the average number of people a person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one.
Recent data at the time suggested that the country was doing better in "flattening the curve", but was warned of a "resurgence" and must ramp up mass testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further transmission of COVID-19.Sometime in late April, local government units (LGUs) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine measures without the consent of the IATF-EID.
Prior to that period, LGUs could impose such measures in coordination with the Department of the Interior and Local Government.
The ECQ in Luzon was extended until May 15 in some areas.
This included Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Central Luzon (except Aurora), Pangasinan, and Benguet.
ECQ measures were also extended in the provinces of Iloilo and Cebu as well as in Davao City.
Other areas were downgraded or placed under general community quarantine (GCQ).

On May 14, Typhoon Vongfong (local name: Ambo) landed on Samar Island.
In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the dual threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex and dangerous evacuation.
At each shelter in the central part of the Philippines, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, only half of the capacity was accepted, and a mask was required when evacuating.
Typhoon Vongfong killed five people in the Philippines.
By the time Vongfong landed, the number of confirmed infections was 11,618 and the number of deaths (due to infectious diseases) was 772 in the Philippines.
Vongfong also approached Manila, but due to severe restrictions on going out of Manila, most people, including low-income people living in simple houses, could not go to shelters and were forced to wait at home.
After May 15, the Philippine government revised its quarantine classifications in correspondence to an earlier announcement that "Science and Economics will be considered for any changes of the lockdown measures."
A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was applied to Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City, while a GCQ was raised to 41 provinces and 10 cities with moderate risk.
Meanwhile, 40 provinces and 11 cities that were considered "low-risk areas" were supposed to be released from community quarantine measures, but were eventually upgraded to a "modified general community quarantine" (MGCQ) after a reportedly "honest mistake" from the national government and requests from respective LGUs.
Once again, the Philippine government revised its announcements and declared the entire country under GCQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City continued to implement an MECQ.
This was temporary until guidelines of MGCQ for low-risk areas were finalized.
The IATF-EID also reportedly considered the reclassification of provinces and cities in Central Luzon as "high-risk areas" under MECQ.After receiving petitions from LGUs,
the IATF-EID revised its quarantine policies yet again.
Cebu City and Mandaue were placed under ECQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna, and Central Luzon (except for Aurora and Tarlac) were all under MECQ.
The remaining parts of the country were placed under GCQ.

=== June to July 2020 ===
Quarantine measures raised throughout the country started to loosen up on June 1, with areas formerly under ECQ transitioning to a less strict quarantine.
This led to a significant rise in the number of confirmed cases, as more areas implemented a GCQ.

The official start of classes in the elementary and secondary schools which customarily begin on June was postponed.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act expired within this month.
According to the national government, the law expired on June 25, due to its sunset provision although there were interpretations that the law expired as early as June 5.
Senator Sonny Angara argued that per the Constitution "emergency powers cease upon the next adjournment of Congress" and that he considers the Bayanihan Act as an emergency measure.
The national government maintains that the law was to expire on June 25.
Upon expiration of the law, the national government is not anymore obliged to hand out cash subsidies to families affected by community quarantine measures.
The DOH reported an overwhelmingly high number of recoveries on July 30, as the department began its "Oplan Recovery" to clear out its discrepancies with LGU counts.
Under the data reconciliation of the DOH, starting from July 15, mild cases and asymptomatic cases will be recorded as recovered after 14 days from swab collection for testing.
The first set of "mass recovery" was recorded on July 30 with 37,180 recoveries.
From July 30, recovery reconciliations will be reported every 15 days.

===
August 2020 ===
On August 2, the Philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the country continues to report around 2,000–3,000 cases a day.
The country eventually had the most COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia when it finally breached Indonesia's total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was placed in Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal from August 4 to 18 as a response to the petition of medical front liners requesting an ECQ in Metro Manila.

In early August, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) became involved in a corruption scandal, and its executives were alleged to have used the pandemic as a cover-up to steal billions of pesos.
The Philippine Genome Center (PGC) had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in the Philippines.
The new variant is said to be globally dominant variant than other variants of the virus at the time of detection and has been associated with the sudden increase of new cases in July.
By August 18, the DOH has identified 1,302 COVID-19 clusters throughout the country with the majority being located in Metro Manila.

===
September to November 2020 ===
On September 11, President Duterte signed Republic Act
No.
11494 or the Bayanihan
to Recover as One Act into law.
President Duterte then extended the period of the state of calamity until September 2021, through his Proclamation
No.
1021 filed on September 18.The IATF-EID
also announced on September 18 that all cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial parks nationwide will be closed from October 29 to November 4 to prevent social gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the All Saints' Day observance.
This is similar to the proposal made by Metro Manila mayors few days prior.
COVID-19 has spread to all provinces in the Philippines by September 28, when Batanes recorded its first case.

=== December 2020 ===
In mid-December, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as Lineage B.1.1.7 was identified in the United Kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than earlier variants of the virus.
This has led to several countries to restrict or ban travel from the United Kingdom, including the Philippines.
The Philippines also banned travel from 19 other nations which has reported cases of more-infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2.The DOH announced in a briefing held in January 2021 that the U.K. variant is already in the Philippines as early as December 2020.
One of the samples collected by the health department on December 10 tested positive for the variant on January 21, 2021.

=== January 2021 ===
By January 2021, the DOH is already monitoring at least two other noted mutations aside from the U.K. variant, namely the 501.V2 variant which originated from South Africa and another variant from Malaysia.
On January 5, 2021, Hong Kong reported that they detected the U.K. variant from a 30-year-old woman who arrived in the city from the Philippines on December 22, 2020, raising concerns that the strain may already be in the Philippines.
The following day, a joint DOH–PGC study said that it has not detected the U.K. variant among 305 samples collected from November to December hospital admissions involving inbound travellers who have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in the country.

Epidemiologist John Wong, who is part of DOH's technical advisory working group, said in a press briefing on January 6 that if Lineage B.1.1.7 establishes itself in the Philippines, the total number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold.
Wong provided two scenarios which assumed there are 20,000 cases at the beginning of the month.
In the first scenario, COVID-19 has a r rate of 1.1 and the U.K. variant does not reach the Philippines which project an increase of cases to 32,000 by the end of the month.
In the second scenario where Lineage B.1.1.7 does indeed establish itself in the country, the projected rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the same time period.
On January 13, the DOH announced that the U.K. variant has been detected in the country when a 29-year-old man from Quezon City, who arrived in the country from the United Arab Emirates on January 7, tested positive for COVID-19.
13 individuals who came in contact with the man also tested positive for COVID-19 days later.
On January 22, 16 new cases associated with the U.K. variant has been confirmed in several places in country including Benguet, Laguna, and Mountain Province.
A case each in Benguet and Laguna had no known contact with a confirmed case or a travel history outside the country.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to the Pfizer–BioNTech and the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccines on January 14 and 28, respectively.

=== February 2021 ===
On February 18, the DOH in Central Visayas announced that two mutations of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Cebu.
The mutations were classified as "mutations under investigation" and were tagged as E484K and N501Y.


===
March 2021 ===
The DOH announced the detection of the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Pasay on March 2.
On March 12, Lineage P.1, commonly known as the Brazilian variant, was detected in the country, along with a "unique" variant originating from the Philippines which was designated as the P.3 variant, which in turn related to the aforementioned variant.
Japan also detected the P.3 variant on a man who traveled from the Philippines.
As a response to the recent spike in cases, the Greater Manila Area, which the government called "NCR Plus", was placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) on March 22 and was originally set to expire on April 4.
It was further intensified to the stricter enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March 29 to April 11, when the positivity rate of the area remained high.
On March 17, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that there have been at least 27,967 deaths caused by, or associated with, COVID-19 by the end of 2020.
19,758 of these were tagged "COVID-19 virus not identified", while 8,209 were tagged "COVID-19 virus identified".
The discrepancy between the tallies of the DOH and the PSA is due to the inclusion of probable and suspect cases in the PSA's tally.

=== April 2021 ===
On April 2, the Philippines has logged 15,310 new cases, the highest number of daily cases since the beginning of the pandemic.

==
Cases ==


===
By location ===
Metro Manila, having over 430,000 cases and 6,000 deaths, is considered as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines.
More than half of the total number of cases in the country is attributed to the region.
It is followed by the neighboring Calabarzon and Central Luzon regions with a combined total of 254,064 cases.
Bangsamoro, on the other hand, has the lowest number of cases in the country.

===
By demographic ===


====
Front line workers ====
As of April 25, 2021, there have been 17,365 healthcare workers that tested positive for COVID-19.
17,082 out of these cases have already recovered, while 88 have died.
On the early months of the pandemic in the country, the number of healthcare workers infected by the virus was significantly higher compared to the infection rate of other health care workers in the Western Pacific Region.
By January 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 virus had infected more than 9,381 police officers from the Philippine National Police (PNP), 1,137 military personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and 160 members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG).
====
Locally stranded individuals ====
The arrival of locally stranded individuals (LSI) on their home provinces has been associated to new clusters of the disease in previously least affected regions.

====
Repatriates ====
Of the 1,098,954 returning overseas Filipinos (ROF) reported on April 25, 2021, 1,093,400 have tested negative for the disease and have been discharged from quarantine facilities, while 16,614 have tested positive.

====
Overseas Filipinos ====
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) provides information regarding the number of Filipino nationals abroad to have contracted COVID-19.
The DFA keeps an official tally of confirmed Filipino COVID-19 cases per region instead of by country.
As of April 26, 2021 there have been 18,253 overseas Filipinos from 93 countries and territories that tested positive for COVID-19.
This count is not included in the national tally of cases by the DOH.

===
Suspected cases ===
The DOH previously used the designation "patients under investigation" (PUIs) and "persons under monitoring" (PUMs) to manage suspected and confirmed cases.
PUIs involved individuals who had a travel history to Wuhan but by February 3, 2020, the DOH has expanded the scope of PUIs to include individuals who had a travel history to any part of China.
"
Persons under monitoring" are asymptomatic individuals with known history of exposure to another person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
On April 11, 2020, the DOH revised its terminology for PUIs; "suspect" and "probable" cases.
Suspect cases involve individuals exhibiting flu-like symptoms and have a history of travel to areas with reported local transmission within 14 days before the manifestation of their symptoms.
Someone with fever, cough, or shortness of breath who is above 60 years old, pregnant, with other underlying illness, or a health worker could also be considered as a suspect case.
Patients admitted to a hospital due to severe symptoms caused by an undetermined lung disease could also be tagged as a suspect case.
Probable cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further validation, and those who were tested but whose test was not facilitated in an official laboratory for a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test.
The usage of the PUM designation has since been discontinued.
It was reasoned that it is assumed that the general public has been exposed to COVID-19 due to local or community transmission already ongoing in several parts of the Philippines.
By July 14, 2020, there had been 38,909 suspected cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the country.

==
Medical response ==


===
Hospital admission policy ===
The DOH has issued a reminder, that Level 2 and 3 hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and refusal of admission is a "violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the PhilHealth accordingly".
The department said that Level 2 and 3 hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms while individuals in a serious or critical condition may be transferred to one of the DOH's three main referral hospitals, which was increased over time to 75 designated hospitals as of April 13 with a combined bed capacity of 3,194.

On March 16, the DOH announced a revision on their protocol on hospital admission for COVID-19 positive patients.
A week prior, the DOH has began sending both asymptomatic patients and individuals with mild symptoms back on their homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until they have been deemed recovered.
Priority are given to high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms for hospital admission.

===
Drug therapy and vaccine development ===


====
Vaccine trial participation ====
The Philippines, with at least 45 other countries, has joined the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Solidarity trial to study the effectivity of certain drugs in treating COVID-19 patients.
Dr. Marissa Alejandria of the Philippine Society of Microbiology and Infectious Disease is the Philippines' representative in the study with Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire as the official liaison of the DOH in the multinational study.
The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) announced that it is seeking bilateral collaboration with other countries such as China, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom on endeavors related to the vaccine development for COVID-19.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a bounty for anyone who could produce a vaccine against COVID-19, an amount later increased to ₱50 million (around $1 million).

====
Research on other treatments ====
The Philippine Council on Health Research and Development at the DOST plans to distribute an undisclosed "functional food," while Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque also revealed that the DOST, Philippine General Hospital, and the Ateneo de Manila University, are collaborating with the Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore to evaluate the feasibility of lauric acid from virgin coconut oil, Vitex negundo (known locally as Lagundi), and Euphorbia hirta (known locally as Tawa-tawa) as a "dietary regimen supplement" to help COVID-19 patients combat the disease.
A "functional food" or "dietary regimen supplement" is described as similar to how tawa-tawa is also used as a remedy against dengue by incorporating it to the diet of diagnosed patients.

===
Vaccination ===


====
Supply ====
The Philippine government has been negotiating with various foreign vaccine manufacturers to secure the country's COVID-19 vaccine supply.
These manufacturers include Sinovac Biotech (China), Gamaleya Research Institute (Russia), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States).
The private sector, with government sanction, has secured at least 2.6 million vaccine doses from British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca.
Negotiations are also ongoing with American firm Novavax which would supply at least 30 million doses from the Serum Institute of India.
The country is projected to at least 60 million doses from various manufacturers in 2021.The procurement efforts of the national government has been a subject of various controversies.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque has been alleged to "dropped the ball" in a deal with Pfizer vaccine deal which could have secured 10 million doses by as early as January 2021.
Plans to secure 25 million doses from China's Sinovac has also been put into scrutiny in the Congress due to its reported efficacy rate.
Late stage trials of Sinovac's vaccine  in Brazil reported an efficacy rate of only 50 percent.
There were concerns within the Senate that the reported 50-percent efficacy rate of Sinovac's vaccine would not garner public trust and would be a waste of government funds.
The Department of Health said that Sinovac's vaccine satisfy the World Health Organization standards of at least 50 percent efficacy rate while the FDA pointed out that Sinovac is yet to publish an official and published scientific report on their vaccines efficacy rate and that the clinical trial for the vaccine is conducted in different countries and the efficacy rate per country will vary; as low as 50 percent in Brazil and as high as above 90 percent in Turkey.

==== Authorization and usage ====
On December 2, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
Under certain conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a month instead of undergoing the usual six-month review process.
Among the conditions is for a vaccine manufacturer to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a "mature" regulator.
The FDA announced that three vaccine manufactures namely Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have inquired on the process of obtaining an EUA in the Philippines.
On December 23, Pfizer has applied for an EUA for its vaccine.
Duterte also said in December 2020 that some members of the military already received COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer, Sinopharm despite the vaccine not yet officially approved by the country's health authorities.
Few days later, it was reported that some members of the Presidential Security Group had also received vaccine from unknown manufacturer.

===
Testing ===
Early COVID-19 testing in the Philippines was only limited to persons with travel history to countries with cases of local transmission and those with exposure to the individuals confirmed to have COVID-19.
The testing protocols were revised sometime in mid-March 2020 to give priority to the testing of any individual with severe symptoms as well as to the elderly, pregnant and immunocompromised persons with at least mild symptoms.
On March 30, symptomatic healthcare workers are also considered priority for testing.
During his press briefing on May 19, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that the people aimed to be tested in the government's "expanded targeted testing" are as follows: "(1)
all symptomatic cases, (2)
all of those coming from abroad, (3) all close contacts of confirmed cases that were found through contact tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid antibody tests.
"
The government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the Philippines' entire population and 10–12% of the worst affected region in the country, which is Metro Manila.
In late March 2020, some politicians and their relatives were reportedly tested for the disease despite not showing any symptoms, causing public backlash amidst a shortage of testing kits since it was against DOH guidelines to test asymptomatic individuals.
The DOH responded to the public criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no policy for VIP treatment" with regard to testing for COVID-19 and that "all specimens are being processed on a first-in, first-out basis," it "extends courtesy" to front line government officials, specifically those involved in national security and public health.
Some senators who were tested claim that they used rapid antibody tests not accredited by the DOH at that time.
On January 24, 2021, after receiving a go-signal from the national government, the Philippine Red Cross announced that they will start conducting COVID-19 tests using saliva samples on January 25.

====
Testing capacity ====
In July 2020, there were currently 85 testing laboratories nationwide with 25,000 tests conducted daily.
The country has conducted over 3 million tests as of September 2020.On March 9, 2020, a total of 2,000 tests has been conducted at a rate of 200 to 250 people accommodated by tests per day.
The testing capacity of the Philippine government has been expanded by late March 2020.
As of March 23, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa alone can test 600 people per day, other laboratories except for the facility of San Lazaro Hospital, Manila, can do 100 tests, while the said hospital can do 50 tests per day.
By March 27, the release of test results conducted at the RITM takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the institute is committed to reducing the turnaround to two to three days.
The DOH announced that the country will conduct targeted mass testing on April 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible, probable, and high-risk patients, such as health workers, expectant mothers, and patients with other medical conditions.
The country's testing continuously increased, except when RITM temporarily scaled down its operations from April 20–24 after 43 of its staffs tested positive for the virus.
The Philippines has the capability to conduct mass testing, either through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rapid antibody testing, given the increased number and improving capacity of the country's accredited laboratories and the procurement of more testing kits.
The first localized targeted mass testing began in Valenzuela, Metro Manila on April 11.
Other local government units followed suit shortly after the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) adopted a resolution that commences 'a national government-enabled, local government unit-led, and people-centered response' to COVID-19.

====
Testing kits ====
The Food and Drug Administration has approved the usage of 75 PCR test kits (including one locally developed kit), 79 rapid antibody testing kits, 53 immunoassay testing kits, and 7 other testing kits as of July 30.

A locally developed PCR testing kit has been made by the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines Manila.
It is reportedly six times cheaper than its foreign counterparts.
It was first approved for commercial use in April 2020 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but some kits were recalled in May by its manufacturer, after it was found out that testing using the kits yields indeterminate results 30 percent at the time.
A month later, the testing kit were re-approved after its defects were fixed.

====
Testing facilities ====
Before January 30, there were no medical facilities in the country that can confirm cases of the virus.
Before that date, the RITM conducted preliminary tests on suspected cases to determine if they are infected with a coronavirus but could not detect the new strain on patients.
Samples from suspected cases with confirmed coronavirus infection had to be sent abroad to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing specifically for SARS-CoV-2.The National Task Force for COVID-19 created the Task Force T3 (Test, Trace, and Treat) to establish public-private partnerships that would conduct mass testings.
The task force cited the San Miguel Corporation as a pioneer in the move to open its COVID-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of its 70,000 employees.
As of August 24, the country has 110 subnational laboratories capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2.

====
Testing backlogs ====
From May 29 to June 17, 2020, the DOH had included testing backlogs on their daily case bulletin.
These backlogs were referred to as "late cases" and were validated by the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau after more than four days of the release of test results.
Late cases were reported alongside new cases or "fresh cases", which corresponded to the cases that were validated three days within the release of test results.
This change was implemented by the health department to clarify the sudden increase of cases in the country.
The then-largest single-day increase on the number of confirmed cases in the country has been accounted to the backlog in late June 2020, when 2,434 new cases were announced.
1,147 out of these cases were fresh cases and the remaining 1,287 were late cases.
It surpassed the backlog in late May 2020, where 1,000 out of 1,046 cases were reported to be late cases.

==
Government response ==


===
Nationwide measures ===
The national government declared a state of calamity over all of the Philippines on March 16, 2020, by virtue of Proclamation
No.
929 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte.
The declaration brings into effect for six months the following:
price control of basic needs and commodities,
granting interest-free loans,
distribution of calamity funds,
authorization of importation and receipt of donations, and
hazard allowance for public health workers and government personnel in the fields of science and technology.

====
Legislative response ====
Following the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would authorize Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated ₱438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic.
In the House of Representatives, the bill was introduced as House Bill No.
6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros–Taguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district.
In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No.
1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors.
The House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate.
President Duterte signed the bill into law on March 25.
The law was effective for three months until June 25, owing to its sunset provision.
A legislation was proposed to replace the Bayanihan Act, dubbed as the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2.
On August 20, the bicameral committee approved a reconciled version of the bill.
It was signed into law by President Duterte on September 11.

===
Lockdowns ===
The government has varying levels of lockdown and/or stay-at-home orders across all the country's local government units characterized as "community quarantines".
The strictest of these measures is designated as enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).
Restrictions were imposed on various aspects of society such as mass public transportation, mass gathering, and operation of businesses.

In April 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte warned anyone who violates the country's lockdown measures could be shot for causing trouble.

===
Travel restrictions ===
Travel of foreign nationals to the Philippines is banned with few exceptions since March 2020.
The issuance of visas to all foreign national on March 19 was stopped and all visas already issued are voided except to those issued to families of Filipino nationals would remain valid.
Three days later a travel ban was imposed on all foreign nationals, except spouses of Filipino citizens (and their children), and workers for international organizations and non-governmental organizations accredited in the country.

===
Foreign aid ===
The government of China and the United States has pledged support to the Philippine government response against COVID-19.
China announced that it would be donating medical supplies including 100,000 testing kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks, and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment.
The United States Agency for International Development also pledged $2.7 million worth of aid to help the Philippines develop adequate testing capabilities, and ensure the availability of medical supplies through the agency's "on-the-ground partners".
China's aid was received on March 21, 2020.On March 22, 2020, the DFA said that the Philippines would be receiving a donation from Singapore consisting of 3,000 testing kits and a polymerase chain reaction machine.
In early April 2020, the DFA announced it received 20 units of testing kits, capable of 1,000 tests, from Brunei.
The United Arab Emirates also donated medical supplies in May 2020.On March 28, 2020, it was disclosed that some of the test kits made in China were only 40% accurate in testing for signs of the COVID-19 on an individual suspected to be infected with the disease.
The test kits were donated by a private foundation.

==
Economic impact ==


===
Economic indicators ===
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) revised its economic growth outlook for the Philippines in 2020 from a 6.5% to 7.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth registered in late 2019 to a 5.5% to 6.5% GDP growth, following the pandemic.
The NEDA cited the decline in service exports, especially tourism.
Moody's Analytics also reduced their GDP growth outlook for the country, from 5.9% in 2019 to 4.9% following the pandemic.
Meanwhile, Nomura gave a bitter prediction of 1.6%, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave an almost flat growth of 0.6% for this year before rebounding to 7.6% in 2021.Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno and
then-NEDA Director-General Ernesto Pernia forecast that the Philippine economy would likely enter a recession in 2020 due to the effect of the pandemic.
Diokno stated that, although the first quarter is likely to grow by 3% since the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine only took effect near the end of the quarter, the second and third quarters would likely experience contractions in economic growth.
The Philippines' real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 1998, a year after the Asian financial crisis, with a technical recession deemed "likely" to be posted within 2020.On the other hand, the BSP records an inflation rate of 2.2% in April and 2.5% in March compared from 2.6% in February and 2.9% in January.
The average rate of 2.6% for the period of January to April 2020 is also 1% lower compared to the inflation rate from the same period in the previous year.
The event was primarily and hugely caused by lower oil prices and transportation costs, even if the prices of food supplies and alcoholic beverages and tobacco slightly rose.
In terms of the amount of economic loss that the Philippines is projected to suffer, NEDA gave a value of up to ₱2.0 trillion, or equivalent to about 9.4% of 2020 nominal GDP, while the Philippine Institute for Development Studies estimates at a maximum of ₱2.5 trillion.
International organizations also gave their predictions, with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation envisioning a ₱273-billion loss and the Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières envisioning a combined loss of more than ₱1 trillion just in the month of April.
The pandemic also affected the goal of the Philippines to be among the countries with upper-middle-income country status by nominal GNI per capita.
Before his resignation, Pernia said that the country will still achieve this goal by 2020, while his replacement, acting NEDA Director-General Karl Kendrick Chua, said last May that this goal will be achieved in 2022.
Daniel Ross of Bloomberg also stated that the Philippines, which is "an economic star poised to outpace long-time regional winners such as China, Indonesia and India," will face hindrances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 9, 2020, the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) index lost 457.77 points or 6.76%, its steepest decline since the financial crisis of 2007–08.
The following day, shares plunged by 6.23% to ₱5,957.35 (US$117.54), settling below the 6,000 level benchmark and entering the bear market territory.
The mining and oil industries were the most affected with a 9.05% drop, followed by holding companies with a 6.93% drop.
The PSE's circuit breaker mechanism was invoked for the second time since the measure's introduction in 2008 halting trade for 15 minutes.
The Philippines' GDP saw its worst contraction since World War II posting a growth of −9.5% for 2020 according to the Philippine Statistics Authority records from 1947.
The last full-year contraction was in 1998 amidst the Asian financial crisis where the GDP grew by −0.5%.
The 2020 contraction was also worse than the – 7% contraction in 1984.

===
Employment ===
In terms of unemployment rate, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) records an estimated unemployment rate of 5.3% in January 2020, which is the same with January 2019.
Moody's Analytics puts its estimate at 5.3% for the first quarter of 2020, while Nomura expects 7.5% for Q1 and a 13-year high of 8% in Q2 of this year.
Meanwhile, the IMF stated that the unemployment rate in the country would be 6.2% for this year compared to 5.1% in 2019.
A higher rate of 6.8% for this year was also predicted by S&P Global Ratings.
The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines estimates that around 7,000 people may lose jobs within the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic.
Economists from the Ateneo de Manila University estimate that 57% of the country's workforce may be displaced within the end of the first quarter of 2020.
It comprises around 15 million workers in Luzon that were laid off due to the enhanced community quarantine, around four million of whom are based in Metro Manila, as well as an estimated 4.3 million workers in Visayas and another 4.3 million in Mindanao that were laid off due to quarantine restrictions.
In March, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) stated that 1.05 million workers were displaced due to the pandemic, even after they released guidelines for employers in handling the impact of COVID-19.Philippine aviation services were heavily affected after travel, both locally and internationally, was restricted to contain the spread of the virus.
Some German businesses that are based in the country also reported to reduce investments in the country, but will continue to maintain their employees.
In early 2021, there were reports that some employers are requiring its workers to get vaccinated before allowing them to physically report for work, with some workers threatened to be placed on floating status if they are not able to comply.
DOLE released a statement that such practice is illegal and workers should be only vaccinated on a voluntary basis.
===
Food service and supply ===


====
Services ====
Following directives from the Philippine government, several fast food and restaurant chains suspended dine-in services and restricted operations to take-out and delivery.
Following the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine, online food ordering services such as GrabFood and Foodpanda temporarily halted but eventually resumed operations in Luzon during the quarantine period.
Several restaurants and coffee shops across the country offered free food and beverages to front line professionals involved in the pandemic, especially health care workers.

Production and distribution ====
Food production and distribution slowed down during the pandemic, especially in Luzon, primarily due to the lack of financial assistance and inaccessibility of transportation resulting from community quarantine measures being implemented across numerous local governments.
The delivery of fresh vegetables from the province of Benguet, which supplies the country with over 80 percent of the country's highland vegetable requirements, was halted due to the implementation of an "extreme enhanced" community quarantine in La Trinidad.
Local government officials advised local rice farmers to sell their harvests to them, assuring them that they would help distribute it to their respective communities amid the border restrictions.
On March 27, Vietnam announced that it would reduce its production and exportation of rice due to food security amid the pandemic.
The Philippines, the largest importer of rice in the world, imports 25% of its rice from Vietnam.
Agriculture Secretary William Dar assured that there would be "no shortage of the staple during the duration of the enhanced community quarantine and beyond" as "harvest [
is] already coming in."
Dar also stated the Department of Agriculture's plans to initiate early planting in the Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon, two of the largest rice producers in the country, ahead of the third quarter of 2020.Production of canned fish in the country was adversely affected with Zamboanga City, which accounts for 85% of the country's canned fish industry, announcing it would reduce the production of canned fish in the Philippines by 50–60% due to difficulties encountered following the implementation of a city-wide lockdown.

===
Gambling ===
The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) ordered the suspension of all gaming operations in the country, including the land-based casinos in Entertainment City and Newport City, on March 15.
The gaming regulator also announced that they were limiting the operations of Philippine offshore gaming operations in the region.
Illegal gambling activities conducted online, including online cockfighting or e-sabong, through social media has proliferated amidst the pandemic.
PAGCOR has aimed to regulate online cockfighting, as part of efforts to expand the source of funds for the government.

===
Medical supply ===
A shortage of medical masks was reported in various parts of the country due to concerns over the pandemic.
RITM director Celia Carlos urged the public against hoarding masks to ensure ample supply for medical workers directly dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, are acting against reports of traders hoarding face masks and selling said item at an overpriced rate.
The DTI has also directed its Philippine International Trading Corp. to import 5 million masks from overseas.
Medtecs International Corp. Ltd., the sole manufacturer of medical mask in the country, has committed to supply the government through the DTI.Doctors in the Philippines have deplored the shortages in personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, and was even cited as the cause of high infection rate and death rate of healthcare workers in the country.
To address this issue, the Philippine government continues to procure and stockpile such equipment, as the pandemic is expected to last until 2021.According to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, the country also issued requests for ventilators and respirators that will be used for severe or critical COVID-19 patients, as there are reported shortages of these equipment.

===
Retail ===
According to the Philippine Retailers Association, the "total retail environment" saw a decline of 30–50%.
SM Investments, the country's largest retailer, saw a decline of 10–20% in domestic sales.
Despite the decline, most retail stores that provide essential services, including supermarkets, convenience stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies, remained open across the country to sustain consumers while other establishments at malls closed down.
Such retail stores, however, imposed strict social distancing measures with some supermarkets only allowing 50 customers inside at a time and placing stickers on the floor to indicate that customers must stand one meter apart from each other.
Stores were also regularly disinfected and customers were required to undergo a temperature check before entering.
In the Greater Manila Area, several online grocers continued to operate, but with limited delivery slots.
After most industries in the country being closed for two months, many stores in the retail sector are already allowed to open under revised guidelines of eased community quarantines.
Panic buying and hoarding became rampant across the country, especially with essential goods such as food and sanitation products.
The Philippine Amalgamated Supermarkets Association reported that the purchases of masks, alcohol, and other personal hygiene products in supermarkets across the country had already surged, urging the public against panic buying.
Economic think-tank Fitch Solutions forecasts that the consumer and retail sector, especially non-essential businesses, would be one of the hardest-hit sectors in the Philippines as it loses sales revenue for an entire month due to the Luzon enhanced community quarantine (Luzon accounts for 73% of the country's GDP).
Fitch Solutions forecasts the household final consumption expenditure for the country in 2020 to expand by 6.7% year-over-year, which was adjusted from a "pre-coronavirus projection" for 2020 of 7% growth year-over-year.
Mall operators across the country, such as Ayala, Megaworld, SM, Robinsons, and Vista, initially shortened the operating hours of its malls to comply with government quarantine measures.
While doing so, malls were asked to implement social distancing measures; for example, several malls implemented a "single-seat gap" policy in cinemas, in which moviegoers were required to sit one seat apart from each other.
However, most malls in the country have since limited its operations to establishments providing essential services, particularly groceries, banks, and hardware stores.

===
Travel ===
Local airlines AirAsia, Philippine Airlines, and Cebu Pacific suspended flights in response to the imposition of travel bans by the Philippine government and some foreign governments.
The airlines have suspended flights as early as February 2, 2020, covering routes involving destinations in China, Hong Kong and Macau.
At least Philippine Airlines has suspended all of its flights by March 2020, although the airline has announced plans to resume selected flights by June 1, 2020.

Social impact ==


===
Census ===
The 2020 census of population and housing in the Philippines was originally scheduled in May but was postponed indefinitely due to the increasing number of cases in the country.

===
Education ===


====
2019–20
academic year ===
=
Suspension of classes began as early as March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 16, the Department of Education (DepEd) issued guidelines prohibiting public schools in areas with suspended classes from administering the final examinations of students and instead compute the students' final grades for the 2019–20 academic year based on "their current academic standing."
and directed schools in other areas to administer final examinations within that week on a "staggered basis" and for teachers and students to observe social distancing measures.

Some universities resorted to implementing online learning alternatives.
The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also advised institutions of higher education to implement distance education methods of learning for its classes, such as the use of educational technology, to maximize the academic term despite the suspensions; However, following the announcement of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and other areas, colleges and universities suspended mandatory online classes in consideration of the welfare of its students, faculty, and staff.
Academic administration offices continued to operate with a skeleton crew, while other offices in colleges and universities operated through telecommuting arrangements.
Some schools, however, continued to hold online classes, and in response, several student groups appealed to CHED to suspend mandatory online classes in consideration of the logistical limitations and well-being of a majority of students.
Classes in all levels across the country were eventually suspended due to the pandemic.
Graduation rites in Philippine schools were also either canceled, postponed, or held virtually.

The Department of Education has moved the opening of classes to October 5, 2020.
Earlier in June, officials reported that schools will not open until a vaccine is available, though remote learning should resume at the end of August.
A group of UP experts has proposed the start of classes to be pushed back to December in order to limit the spread of the disease.
CHED left the decision of starting semesters to college administrators, although urged them to shift into the new semestral calendar and start 'flexible classes' in August and face-to-face classes in September as well.
Certain measures have been proposed to be implemented during the opening of classes, such as the airing of lectures on television and radio, a "mandatory face mask policy," maintaining physical distancing, and limiting class sizes.

===
Tourism ===
The NEDA reported that the coronavirus pandemic would incur a ₱22.7 billion ($448 million) monthly loss of tourism revenue for the Philippines and the impact of the pandemic could last around five to six months based from past experiences from the SARS, H1N1, and the MERS outbreaks.
Over 5,200 flights covering two months, which was to be serviced by member airlines of the Air-Carriers Association of the Philippines, were canceled.
Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank predicts a ₱111 billion ($2.2 billion) loss in the tourism sector, while the Tourism Congress of the Philippines estimates the figures at around ₱20 billion ($395 thousand), considering that 12.7% of the Philippines' GDP is generated through tourism.
Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières also reported potential damage in Philippine tourism.
The National Museum of the Philippines temporarily closed its complex in Manila and all branch museums throughout the country.
The Philippine Shopping Festival, a nationwide mall sale event backed by the Department of Tourism originally scheduled on March 1–31, 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Several local festivals across the country were also either canceled or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
===
Prisons ===
The impact of COVID-19 in prisons in the Philippines is projected to be "dangerous," since its jails have the highest occupancy rate in the world that stands at 534%.
The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology has temporarily suspended the acceptance of visitors in prisons it manages as early as March 2020, encouraging would-be visitors to avail the e-dalaw service which would allow inmates to communicate with relatives online.
Certain human rights groups raised their concerns on the issue.
Human Rights Watch flagged the cases of dying inmates in prison cells and called for the freedom of minor offenders, the elderly, and the ill.
Karapatan and KAPATID both called for the release of political prisoners that belongs to vulnerable sector as a way to decongest Philippine jails amidst COVID-19 pandemic.
A group of 22 high-risk prisoners (either of old age, immunocompromised, or pregnant) also asked for temporary liberty due to 'humanitarian grounds' since "hellish prison conditions in the Philippines make the detainees vulnerable to COVID-19.
"
All of the 22 prisoners, five of which are consultants of New Peoples' Army (NPA), are asking to be allowed to post bail or to be released under personal recognizance.
They are represented by Public Interest Law Center (PILC) and the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL).
Similarly, one of the suspects in the death of Horacio "Atio" Castillo III pleaded for freedom under the guise of the COVID-19's threat.
In mid-April, the Supreme Court (SC) reiterated its 2014 circular, which allows the temporary freedom of "persons deprived of liberty" who were able to serve their minimum penalty during an ongoing trial or those whose trial are paused due to lack of witnesses.
Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra also signed resolutions that relaxes bail prices for indigent inmates and requirements to avail parole and executive clemency.
On May 2, Associate Justice Mario Victor Leonen announced that there were 9,731 detainees released temporarily by the SC from March 17 to April 29 as a way to alleviate the country's overcrowding prisons.

===
Entertainment and media ===
The DOH issued an advisory for the cancellation of large public events and mass gatherings, such as concerts, until further notice to minimize the risk of spreading the disease.
This prompted several local and international artists to either cancel or postpone their scheduled concerts and fan meets.
Local television networks temporarily stopped admitting live audiences for their television shows, including variety shows Eat Bulaga!
on GMA Network as well as
It's Showtime and ASAP on ABS-CBN.
On March 13, both ABS-CBN and GMA announced that they would suspend productions on their drama shows as well as other entertainment programs by March 15, replacing affected programs with reruns of previous series or extended newscast runs.
Broadcast radio companies are also curtailing their operations during the quarantine period, either by shortening their broadcast hours and/or suspending regular programming in favor of "special broadcasts".

===
Religion ===
The Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines has issued preventive guidelines against the pandemic through the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP).
In January 2020, the CBCP issued a liturgical guideline which urges Mass attendees to "practice ordinarily" the receiving of communion by hand, and avoid holding hands while praying the Lord's Prayer during Mass.
As a spiritual measure against the spread of the disease, the CBCP also composed an oratio imperata (obligatory prayer) which is to be recited during Mass.
In February 2020, the CBCP issued a second liturgical guideline in anticipation of the Lenten season.
The bishops suggested that during Ash Wednesday, ashes would be sprinkled on the faithfuls' head instead of the customary marking of the forehead with a cross to minimize body contact.
The CBCP also urged people to refrain from kissing or touching the cross for veneration during Good Friday, particularly the celebration of the Passion of Jesus.
They suggested genuflection or bowing as an alternative to the practice.
Dioceses across the country have suspended the public celebration of Masses.
On April 8, Holy Wednesday, the CBCP organized an interfaith prayer service against the spread of the coronavirus, which was televised nationwide.
Other Christian denominations and organizations, such as the Iglesia ni Cristo and the Jehovah's Witnesses, have suspended live worship services and resorted to organizing worship services through online platforms.
The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, an organization composed of Evangelical and Protestant church member organizations in the country, also adopted similar measures.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints directed missionaries assigned in the Philippines who are not native to the country to move out for temporary reassignment to another country.
They were ordered to self-quarantine in their new homes for 14 days.
The Islamic community in the Philippines has also adopted measures against COVID-19.
The Regional Darul Ifta' of Bangsamoro suspended all congregational prayers in the Bangsamoro region from March 19 to April 10.

===
Misinformation and hoaxes ===
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged online regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and various other aspects of the disease.
Among these hoaxes include:
SARS-CoV-2 being a type of rabies along with advice to not eat bats.
The virus is in the coronavirus family and is unrelated to rabies.

Boiled ginger as a cure for COVID-19.
There is no concrete scientific proof for this claim.
Mark Pasayan, a doctor from the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases says that while a cold weather may make one more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection, the intake of hot or cold food does not correlate with the prevention and treatment of the disease.

In the first week of February, the government supposedly imposed a 14-day quarantine for travelers coming from 20 countries.
An infographic supporting the claim was circulated purportedly from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).
On February 7, the DILG denied the claim.
At that time the quarantine measure is only being imposed from travelers from three territories: Mainland China, Macau, and Hong Kong.

Viral posts with various claims such as avoidance of eating ice cream and cold food, and encouraging exposure to sunlight as a means of prevention against COVID-19 purportedly from UNICEF.
UNICEF Philippines has issued a statement disassociating itself from the posts peddling false and misleading information.

The DOH supposedly issuing an advisory on the proliferation of fake cigarettes which is claimed to be a method of transmission of COVID-19.
The government agency did not issue such advisory.

A widely circulated graphic on social media claimed that gargling warm water with salt would "eliminate the virus."
DOH Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that while the saline water has been a recognized home treatment for symptoms of a sore throat for many generations, there is no evidence suggesting its capability to kill the virus.

A supposed video spread on the internet about how bananas can cure COVID-19.
This information was even advocated by the presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo.
However, DOH Spokesperson Ma.
Rosario Vergeire debunked this claim, saying that while bananas is a healthy food source, there are no conclusive evidences yet about its effectivity against coronavirus.

On March 21, 2020, several netizens on Facebook shared misleading posts about the Philippine Air Force and the Philippine National Police using helicopters to spray pesticides among major cities in an effort to disinfect the virus.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, the Department of Health, and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) have refuted these claims.
Furthermore, the Department of Health added on its official website that there is no evidence that pesticide sprays can kill the Coronavirus.

The Palace also disproved posts circulating online about the declaration of "Total Lockdown" nationwide and warned its peddlers of imminent arrest.
At the time of the circulation, the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon was already in effect.

A controversial statement from President Rodrigo Duterte claiming that gasoline may be used as a disinfectant in absence of hand sanitizers has been refuted by the Integrated Chemists of the Philippines and warned the public that gasoline is harmful to the body especially if inhaled.
The DOH has advised against spreading misinformation and unverified claims concerning the pandemic.
The Philippine National Police has taken action against the spread of misinformation related to the pandemic and has warned the public that misinformation purveyors could be charged for violating Presidential Decree no.
90 for "declaring local rumor, mongering and spreading false information".
In the case of misinformation circulated online, violators could be charged for violating the Cybercrime Prevention Act which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act also punishes fake news peddlers of two months jail time or fine of up to ₱1 million.
According to the DOH, the cremation of the body of the first confirmed COVID-19 death in the Philippines has been hampered by the proliferation of misinformation.

==
Statistics ==
The DOH publishes official numbers through its daily case bulletins at around 4 pm.
The case bulletin initially had been accompanied by a virtual presser discussing the current status of the pandemic in the country.
The virtual presser was discontinued in August and only being held on certain occasions.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was confirmed to have spread to the Netherlands on 27 February 2020, when its first COVID-19 case was confirmed in Tilburg.
It involved a 56-year-old Dutchman who had arrived in the Netherlands from Italy, where the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to enter Europe.
As of 31 January 2021, there are 978,475 confirmed cases of infections and 13,998 confirmed deaths.
The first death occurred on 6 March, when an 86-year-old patient died in Rotterdam.
On the advice of the Outbreak Management Team (OMT), under supervision of Jaap van Dissel, measures were taken by the Third Rutte cabinet for the public health to prevent the spread of this viral disease, including the "intelligent lockdown".
The government strategy on pandemic control has been criticised for the refusal to acknowledge the role of asymptomatic spread and the role of masks in preventing spread, as well as for the lack of testing capacity, in particular during the first half of 2020.
In March 2020, Prime Minister Mark Rutte called for herd immunity as an important method to stop the pandemic.
On 23 January 2021, as the government imposed a nationwide 9:00 p.m. curfew in a context of emergence of the British variant, the worst riots in 40 years broke out across the country.

==
Background ==
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality rate for COVID-19  has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

: after the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office was renamed “Netherlands Office Taipei" to reflect the increased scope of cooperation between the two countries, the Chinese ambassador expressed discontent, demanded a clarification of the name change, and reminded the Dutch government to dutifully adhere to the one-China principle.
The Global Times warned of a backlash and claimed that users of Chinese social media sites had called for China to immediately stop exporting medical supplies to the Netherlands and that Chinese citizens were demanding a boycott of Dutch products and cancelling their travel plans to the Netherlands.

May 2020 ===
6 May: the government announces that starting from 11
May so-called "contact jobs" such as hairdressers and beauty salons, can open again.
From 1 June, bars can open their outside areas again.
From that date the government also aims to test anyone with COVID-19 symptoms, instead of only health care workers.
The advice "Stay home" changes to "Stay home when showing symptoms".
Face masks become mandatory in public transport, despite the RIVM still doubting the effectivity.

7
May: Minister Hugo de Jonge indicates in a letter to the House of Representatives that large-scale events will not be possible until a vaccine is found.

11
May: indoor pools were also allowed to open again.
Visitors are required to dress at home beforehand and shower at home afterward.
All visitors older than 12 years old have to maintain 1.5 meter distance.

19 May: in a press conference the government announces that more restrictions can be loosened, provided that no new outbreaks will occur.
From 2 June secondary schools will partly open for students.
From 8 June primary schools will fully open.
And from 15 June onwards, middle level (mbo) and high educations (hbo/wo) will partly open.

=== June 2020 ==
=
1 June: bars and restaurants are allowed to open from 12:00.
Inside a maximum of 30 guests are allowed who have to reserve beforehand.
On outdoor terraces no maximum is enforced.
Both in- and outside guests and personnel have to maintain 1.5 meter distance, unless they are from the same household.
On this day there was also a large demonstration on Dam Square in Amsterdam.
This was part of the George Floyd protests.
About 5,000 people converged on the square.
While most of them wore face masks, it was impossible to maintain 1.5 metre distance.
The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, opted to not stop the demonstration, as she feared riots.
She faced harsh criticism afterwards, as this demonstration could cause a new outbreak of COVID-19.
However, almost no cases linked to the demonstration (or similar demonstrations in other cities) were found in the weeks after.
===
July 2020 –
present:
second wave ===
Since mid-July, there has been a large increase in positive cases, from about 50 positive tested people/day to over 7,000 positive tested people per day.
Measures were tightened in late September to achieve control over the spread again.
About 1 in 120 people were deemed infectious in late September.
A record number of 11,107 new cases in one day was reported on 30 October.
From 14 October 22:00, a partial lockdown came into effect.
Cafes, restaurants, and bars were to be closed for at least two weeks.
Starting 1 December, masks were made compulsory to wear while indoors.
From 15 December 2020 through at least 15 March 2021, a hard lockdown is in effect, and all non-essential shops are closed.

On 19 December 2020, it was discovered that a mutant strain of COVID-19, Variant of Concern 202012/01, had entered the Netherlands.
The Dutch government banned flights from the United Kingdom, where the strain was originally identified, in response.
The travel ban is scheduled to remain in place until at least 1 January.
Shortly after Christmas 2020, most European countries started COVID-19 vaccination programs, however the Netherlands expected to start vaccination on 8 January 2021.
The government cited issues with the digital registration system as the cause of the delayed vaccination start.
As of 9 January 2021, a total of 30,000 healthcare workers had been vaccinated, and 96 cases of the Lineage B.1.1.7 variant have been reported.
As of 16 January 2021, 200 cases of that variant have been reported.
These cases cause extra concern, as this variant is suspected to be more contagious, with a reproduction number estimated to 1.3.As of 26 January 2021, over 173,000 people had gotten vaccinated.
In January 2021, it was discovered that personal data of people in the contact tracing database was illegally sold to fraudsters by call center employees having access to them.
A few days earlier, employees of testing company U-diagnostics were found to have shared personal data in a WhatsApp group of 300 employees, violating the GDPR privacy regulations.

===
January 2021
curfew and protests ===
Starting on 23 January 2021, the Dutch government introduced a curfew as means to curb the epidemic.
On 24 January 2021, violent protests erupted as a reaction.
The curfew, imposed between 9 PM to 4:30 AM, was the first of its kind to be enacted in the country since the Second World War.
Protests took place in most major cities, including Amsterdam and Eindhoven.
Police made hundreds of arrests and issued thousands of fines.
The Dutch Police Association described the riots at the worst violence in Netherlands in the last 40 years.
The protests have been described as being composed of mostly young men.
An opinion poll by public broadcaster NOS indicated that the curfew was supported by seven out of 10 Dutch respondents, with just 18% of the population opposing it.
Exceptions to the curfew have been made for several groups of people, including medical emergencies, essential jobs, including delivery, and walking dogs on a leash.

==
Prevention measures and response ==
In late March, the government announced strict social distancing rules as cases surged over 5,000.
All large public events and gatherings are banned until 1 September.
Furthermore, in public space a distance of at least 1.5 metres between people not from the same household must be observed, and shops and other venues are to enforce this distancing among their visitors.
Fines will be issued to those not complying with the new rules.
Companies may face a fine up to €4,000, individuals risk a fine up to €400.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte repeated his call to keep distance from each other.

Final examinations of secondary school were cancelled on 24 March.
Other measures were that schools and day-cares were closed, except for children whose parents work in the 'vital' sectors, like health care.
People were required to work from home as much as possible.
These measures also resulted in modified schedules for public transport, as much less transportation of individuals was necessary.

===
Reaction to second wave ===
As a response to the large increase in positive tests since July, the Dutch government released additional regulations on 13 October.
These include:
Closing the hospitality industry.

Banning the sale of alcohol in the evening, as well as closing non-essential stores.

Limiting group sizes and the number of guests received at home.

Banning events and amateur sports for adults.

Requiring face masks in public indoor spaces, including schools outside classrooms.
Additionally the government advised people to work from home and limit unnecessary travel.

====
Holiday season ====
The Dutch government also stated that people should be mindful of the regulations during the holiday season.
Sint Maarten, a holiday where children collect sweets from neighbors, was still held with social distancing and maximum group size regulations in place.
Sinterklaas was also be held with the same regulations, with people also being advised not to delay holiday shopping to the last possible moment.
In November 2020, the government also announced that it would ban fireworks on New Year's Eve (traditionally the only time of the year that consumers are allowed to purchase and ignite fireworks), citing that firework-related injuries would put too much stress on the healthcare system during the pandemic.

====
Reaction to the B.1.1.7 variant ====
In January 2021, the government extended its regulations and considered tightening them in order to limit the spread of Lineage B.1.1.7, which is estimated to be more contagious.

===
Contact tracing application ===
The Dutch Ministry of Public Health officially maintains an application called CoronaMelder for Android and iOS.

The applications, including the backend are open source software under the European Union Public License.

CoronaMelder launched nationwide on 10 October, and was downloaded 2,6 million times 2 days later.
The maintainers stated that they are unable to track the number of users that actively use the application owing to privacy reasons.
Later that month on 26 October the app had reportedly 3,5 million downloads and around 14.000 reports of positive test results.

==
Testing ==
By mid-March, the country could test about 1,000 samples per day, which is less than the capabilities of other European countries.
This also explains a relatively large ratio of the number of deaths to the number of confirmed cases.
As of 25 March, 2,500 samples have been tested daily and a total number of 38,000 tests performed.
Because of the limited availability of testing capacity, certain groups were prioritised in testing, such as healthcare workers, elderly, and people with acute symptoms.
A lack of testing capacity causes a distinct number of deaths by COVID-19 that are not registered as such, although local doctors can recognise the symptoms.
By the end of March, the country was testing about 4,000 people per day, with the goal of expanding the testing capacity to about 17,500 daily tests in a couple of weeks.
Once such a testing capacity has been reached the Dutch government wants to expand its testing capacity to 29,000 tests a day.

According to a report by the RIVM, an average of 4,280 tests per day have been performed in the period between 9 March and 26 April.
Several health organizations have started testing themselves, claiming the procedures of the GGD testing centers take too long.
In a press conference on 6 May, the government announced that starting from 1 June it wants to test all people with COVID-19 symptoms.
The coordination has been criticized, with the regional GGD offices stating there is no clear national plan to scale up testing.
Nonetheless, the test capacity was increased to 30,000 per day with the GGDs being able to conduct 600 to 2400 contact traces for positively tested applicants with 2-8% of the tests done assumed to result positive for the virus.
On 1 June, a national telephone number was made public through which a test time and location could be scheduled.
The new system, although initially overwhelmed by the number of callers on the first day, tested 50,000 people in the first week and had 100,000 applicants by 11 June.
By 9 June, most regions where successful in handling the increased demand, with people often being able to schedule a test the same day or the day after.
The GGDs strive for a test result to be made known to the applicant within 48 hours, with 96% of results being successfully returned within that time by 11 June.

==
Impact ==
In response to regulations announced on 12 March, panic buying of food, toilet paper and medicines, resulted in empty shelves in supermarkets.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte appealed to the nation to stop this behaviour.
On 12 March it was announced that all public events with more than 100 people will be cancelled until 6 April.
On 24 March this period was extended to 1 June for all permit-requiring events.
Three days later it was announced in a press conference that all restaurants, museums, sport clubs and schools had to close.
A Dutch "grassroots" initiative, Mond Kapjes Nodig was formed to address the local PPE shortages.
More than 400,000 masks was delivered within weeks to those fighting the pandemic in the Netherlands.
This helped relieve the coordination efforts on a national level.
===
Economic ===
On 26 March, the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis published the first calculations of the economic expectations.
These expectations are based on the length of the prevention measures against the coronavirus pandemic.
If these measures are present for three months, the Dutch economy is expected to shrink by 1.2 percent in 2020.
If these measures are required for a year the economy would decline by 10 percent.
In all cases it is expected that the economy will slightly grow the following year.
On 8 June, three months into the crisis, an analysis of Rabobank was published.
They expected that the economy between March and June shrunk by 8%, with the catering sector being hit the most.
They expected that, whereas the crisis was over the peak, the economy would continue shrinking, and the industries, in particular the construction industry, which were doing relatively well, would be hit as well.
The forecast was that the unemployment rate would grow from 3% to 7% by the end of 2020.As a result of the ban on fireworks for the 2020-2021 New Year's Eve the Dutch government has compensated the fireworks industry for around 40 million euros.

The following is a timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during 2020.

==
Background ==
By late November 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 had broken out in Wuhan, China.
As reported in Clinical Infectious Diseases on November 30, 2020, 7,389 blood samples collected between December 13, 2019, and January 17, 2020, by the American Red Cross from normal donors in nine states (California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin) included 84 (1.1 percent) that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
According to the article, "These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have been introduced into the United States prior to January 19, 2020."On December 31, 2019, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) became aware of cases in China and began developing reports for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 1.
==
Timeline ==


===
January 1–20 ==
=
On January 3, CDC Director Robert Redfield was notified by a counterpart in China that a "mysterious respiratory illness was spreading in Wuhan [China]"; he notified HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who shared the report with the National Security Council (NSC).
According to The Washington Post, warnings about the virus were included in the President's Daily Brief in early January, an indicator of the emphasis placed on the virus by the intelligence community.
On January 3, Redfield emailed and spoke to George Gao, director of the Chinese CDC, and the following day, January 4, emailed an offer of technical assistance.
On January 5, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a "pneumonia of unknown cause" in Wuhan.
The WHO advised against travel or trade restrictions at the time.
On January 6, the CDC issued a travel notice for the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China,  and CDC Director Redfield offered in a letter to Chinese officials to send a team of CDC scientists to assist China.
China did not accept the offer for several weeks, which delayed the U.S. access to the virus, important for developing diagnostic tests and a vaccine.

China did release genetic data on the new coronavirus on January 9.During the week of January 6, officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convened an intra-agency task force including Redfield (CDC), Azar (HHS), and Anthony S. Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
On January 7, the CDC established a coronavirus incident management system to better share and respond to information about the virus.
On January 8, the CDC issued its first public alert about the coronavirus.
On January 9, the WHO issued a statement naming the disease as a new coronavirus in Wuhan.
On January 10, the WHO issued a comprehensive package of guidance to countries on how to test for potential cases.
By this date, the WHO warned of the risk of human-to-human transmission.
On January 11, the CDC updated the January 6 Level 1 travel health notice for Wuhan, China.
On January 14, the WHO held a press briefing stating that their information suggested a possibility of limited, but not sustained, human-to-human transmission.
The WHO recommended countries to take precautions due to the human-to-human transmission during earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks.
The WHO also tweeted that "preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV)".
The head of China's National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, confidentially provided a "grim" situation assessment to key Chinese health officials.
The related memo said "human-to-human transmission is possible."
An investigation by AP News indicated that the reporting of a case in Thailand prompted the meeting, as well as the risk of spread with heightened travel during the Chinese New Year and various political considerations.
However, the Chinese public is not warned until January 20.Beginning January 17, the CDC dispatched public health experts to screen incoming airport passengers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, adding monitors at Chicago and Atlanta in late January.
On January 18, HHS Secretary Azar discussed the coronavirus outbreak with President Donald Trump, who, Azar said, criticized him as alarmist.
===
January
20–28 ===
On January 20, Chinese authorities announced the confirmation that human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had already occurred.
The first recorded U.S. case of the new virus was also reported on January 20, in a 35-year-old American citizen traveling from Wuhan, China, to his home in Washington state.
By January 20, the CDC developed its own coronavirus test (as it typically does) and used it to evaluate the first U.S. case.
The CDC test was soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results.
The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation, significantly increasing testing turn-around times.
On January 20, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and State Council premier Li Keqiang issued the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.
On January 20, Fauci announces the National Institutes of Health is already working on the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus.

On January 20, state and local health departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed from the CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had close contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients.
On January 21 the CDC activated its emergency operations center to enhance support for the coronavirus response.
A man who had returned from Wuhan was hospitalized for the virus in Washington state on January 21, 2020.
He was released after two weeks of treatment.
A few days later, another case was reported in Chicago, by a woman who had also just returned from Wuhan.
A third case was confirmed a day later in Orange County, California.
On a January 21 press telebriefing, CDC and Washington State health officials announced the first U.S. case, describing  how he had returned to Seattle via an indirect flight from Wuhan two days before the January 17 start of enhanced airport entry screening.
After arrival, responding to ongoing  passenger education,  he recognized he should seek care and was appropriately evaluated locally with overnight confirmation by CDC with the just finalized test (utilizing the genetic data released days earlier from China), with resulting isolation and contact  tracing.

The press was also advised that the enhanced screening then underway—initially at the 3 locations determined to be receiving the vast majority of direct and connecting flights from Wuhan—had so far processed over 1,200 passengers with negative findings, but that in conjunction with HSA and DOT the CDC was about to operationalize full coverage by a complex funneling of  Wuhan passengers from all over the globe into designated  airports by reissuing tickets and rerouting through connecting and direct flights.
The CDC posture was stated as “being proactive at all levels,” and that they “continue to believe the risk of this novel coronavirus to the American public at large remains low at this time.”

On January 22, Trump received his first public question from a reporter regarding whether he was concerned about the coronavirus.
Trump responded: "No, not at all.
And we have it totally under control.
It's one person coming in from China ...
It's going to be just fine."

Besides this response during a business-press interview while at Davos,  the President told other reporters “we do have a plan
and we think it is going to be handled very well.
We’ve already handled it very well.
The CDC is terrific.
Very professional.”

The NIH
’s
Dr. Fauci, interviewed a few days later on an AMA podcast about this case and the immediately subsequent handful of other travel-related cases, advised that “we handled it properly,” and that fortunately so far there were  no secondary  cases, but cautioned that the next few weeks would be critical as to whether it would become a sustained global outbreak or just "disappear the way SARS did.”
On the same day of the President’s remarks while at Davos, the Emergency Committee of the WHO, meeting in Geneva, could not agree if the events in China warranted a declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), but considered the situation urgent and to reconvene in a matter of days to examine the matter further.

An advisory by the Committee to China included provision that exit screening be conducted at international airports and ports in the affected provinces.
On January 23, Chinese authorities lockdown Wuhan, a city of 11 million, which heightened the urgency for the U.S. response team.
The Washington Post reported that Secretary Azar (HHS) instructed his team to establish a surveillance mechanism shortly thereafter, but the money and diagnostic tests "would elude U.S. officials for months".
The entire Hubei province, which contains Wuhan, was locked-down January 30.On
January 23, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a statement on the coronavirus, indicating that: "Human-to-human transmission is occurring and a preliminary R0 estimate of 1.4–2.5 was presented.
Amplification has occurred in one health care facility.
Of confirmed cases, 25% are reported to be severe.
The source is still unknown (most likely an animal reservoir) and the extent of human-to-human transmission is still not clear."
At the time, the fatality rate was 4% (17 of 557).
The WHO recommended that: "[A]ll countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoV infection, and to share full data with [the] WHO."On January 23 the CDC sought an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA enabling states to use its newly developed coronavirus test.
On January 24, the U.S. Senate was briefed on the coronavirus by key health officials.
U.S. Senators Richard M. Burr, Kelly Loeffler, Dianne Feinstein, and James Inhofe allegedly sold stock thereafter, prior to significant declines in the stock market.
In Senator Loeffler's case, the sales began the same day as the briefing.
All denied any wrongdoing, citing various reasons.
Senator Burr faced calls for his resignation.
On January 24, President Trump praised China for its coronavirus efforts in a tweet.

Four days later WHO director Tedros met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and praised the efforts of the Chinese government in fighting COVID-19.

Two more cases were confirmed on January 26, similarly by two people who had returned from Wuhan.
All cases to this point were allowed to self-isolate at home for two weeks, whereafter they were assumed to be no longer infected or contagious.
On January 27, the WHO assessed the risk of the coronavirus to be "high at the global level".
In a January 27 press update the CDC reported that around 2400 travelers from Wuhan/Hubei had been screened so far, and that from all sources of surveillance there was an accumulation of 110 persons under investigation (PUI) from 26 states of which so far five persons had tested positive and 32 negative.

===
January
29–31 ===
On January 29, the U.S. formally announced a White House Coronavirus Task Force, including senior officials such as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and others at HHS, CDC, and the U.S. State Department.
President Trump attended the meeting on January 29, and tweeted related photos.
However, the scope was limited initially to the logistics of keeping travelers out of the U.S. from China, and evacuating U.S. citizens.
They did not initially focus on testing or supplies in the U.S.On January 29, the U.S. government evacuated 195 State Department employees from Wuhan along with their families and other U.S. citizens to March Air Reserve Base near Riverside, California, where they were kept under quarantine for 14 days, although none had been infected.
The New York Times reported that President Trump was told "at the time" of a January 29 memo by trade adviser Peter Navarro that the coronavirus could cause as many as half a million deaths and trillions in economic damage.
Further, on January 30, HHS Secretary Azar warned President Trump about the "possibility of a pandemic".
On January 29, WHO Health Emergencies program leader Dr. Mike Ryan said in a press briefing: "The whole world needs to be on alert now ... and be ready for any cases that come from the epicenter ..." At the time, 68 cases had been confirmed outside China, affecting persons in 15 countries.
On January 30, the first case of person-to-person transmission was confirmed in Chicago, between a married couple, after the wife returned from China.
On January 30, the WHO named the coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, warning that "all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread".
The statement also praised the "impressive" Chinese response.
The WHO also released a statement that included: "
The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk."
However, the federal government and individual states did not direct their populations to practice social distancing (e.g., stay at home except for essential travel) until March 19.
Further, as late as April 8, five states had no social distancing rules and three others had rules for only parts of the state.

On January 31, another case of a person who returned from Wuhan was confirmed in California, which marked the seventh known case in the U.S.On January 31, the Trump Administration, through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, declared a public health emergency, and imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for any U.S. citizens who has visited Hubei Province in China within the preceding two weeks.
It also began denying entry of non-U.S. nationals who had traveled to China within the preceding two weeks.
This was the first such travel restriction by the U.S. in more than 50 years.
On January 31, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in coordination with the CDC directed all flights to the U.S. carrying travelers recently from, or otherwise present within, the People's Republic of China to arrive at designated U.S. airports where public health resources had been focused.
Three days later the airport list was expanded.

As of January 31, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from state and local health departments, health care providers, and airport health screening personnel to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection from travel, close contact with a 2019-nCov patient or person under investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV in
the U.S.President Trump repeatedly claimed credit for acting early with the travel ban.
However, The Washington Post reported that 300,000 people traveled to the U.S. from China during the month prior to the ban.
[
The travel ban was not a ban, but a 14-day waiting period.
Also, a month before January 31, not even WHO believed COVID had human-to-human transmission and there were no known cases in the United States until January 21  See January 14th above about WHO's lack of knowledge.]The
New York Times reported that more than 40,000 persons traveled from China to the U.S. after the January 31 partial ban, and around 430,000 total between the December 31 disclosure of the outbreak by China and April 4.
The Washington Post reported that six other countries had restricted travel from China before January 30, six did so on January 31, and by the time U.S. travel restrictions became effective on February 2, 38 other countries had taken action before or at the same time as the U.S. restrictions.
The earliest action was Singapore on January 23.
Flights from Europe were not banned until March 11, with hundreds of thousands crossing the Atlantic into the U.S., due to disputes about the impact on the U.S. economy among Trump Administration officials.

=== February ===
==== February
1–15 ====
New cases are being reported throughout the country nearly every day.
Many are people who have recently returned from China, including a college student from Boston and a woman in California who returned from Wuhan.
Two more cases of person-to-person transmission are reported in California.
The Washington Post reported that HHS Secretary Azar, responding to concerns about a "startling" shortage of essential medical supplies (masks, gowns, gloves, etc.),
wrote letters in late January and early February asking for additional funding.
Since China also needed such supplies, replenishing them could be difficult as much of the manufacturing was in China.
He also made a formal request for $4 billion on February 5, which "OMB officials and others at the White House greeted as an outrage".
Congress later increased the figure to $8 billion, and Trump signed it into law on March 6 (two days after passage by Congress on March 4), but this delay meant that the U.S. would increasingly compete with other nations for such supplies.
On February 3, 49 members of Congress signed a letter to CDC Director Redfield highlighting the urgency of distributing a rapid diagnostic kit that could be processed locally, rather than centrally at the CDC in Atlanta, which they referred to as an "unsustainable bottleneck" as the number of suspected cases rise.
On February 3, Reuters reported that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was no need for measures that "unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" to halt the coronavirus.
He praised the Chinese response, and referred to the virus's spread as "minimal and slow".
On February 3, it was reported by Reuters from a briefing by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, that the CDC had a team waiting and ready to go to China as soon as they are allowed to go in.
On February 4, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the CDC diagnostic to test for coronavirus.
On February 5, the twelfth case is discovered: another college student from Wisconsin.
That day, the U.S. evacuates 345 citizens from Hubei Province and takes them to two air bases in California to be quarantined for 14 days.
Another government evacuation flight takes place on February 6, containing 300 passengers, most of who are taken to bases in Nebraska and Texas.
By this time, more than 500 people are quarantined at three air bases.
On February 5, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top officials including Dr Anthony Fauci briefed Congressional lawmakers on the Federal Government's coronavirus response efforts.
On February 6, the Centers for Disease Control began sending 90 of its own viral detection tests to state-run labs which discovered the tests were inadequate and viral samples had to be shipped to the Atlanta CDC lab instead.
Also on February 6, the WHO Director-General said: "We have shipped 250,000 tests to more than 70 laboratories around the world, and we're training lab workers to use them."
Researchers at Stanford and other laboratories had developed tests following the WHO protocol, but "relatively tight" rules at the Food and Drug Administration discouraged them from using them.
These rules were not relaxed until early March.
On February 6, 57-year-old Patricia Dowd of San Jose, California became the first COVID-19 death in the United States (discovered by April 2020).
She died at home without any known recent foreign travel, after being unusually sick from flu in late January, then recovering, working from home, and suddenly dying on February 6.
A February 7 autopsy was completed in April (after virus tests on tissue samples) and attributed the death to Transmural Myocardial Ischemia (Infarction) with a Minor Component of Myocarditis due to COVID-19 Infection.
Her case indicates that community transmission was happening undetected in the US, most likely since December.
In a recorded interview later made public by journalist Bob Woodward, Trump said on February 7 that he knew the novel coronavirus was airborne and that "It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.
"
For the next month, however, he would publicly minimize the threat of the virus, and told Woodward in March that "I wanted to always play it down.
I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.
"On
February 9, The White House Coronavirus Task Force briefed governors from across the nation at the National Governors’ Association Meeting in Washington.
On February 11, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing: "[A] virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack ...
If the world doesn't want to wake up and consider this enemy virus and Public Enemy Number 1, I don't think we will learn our lessons."

Ending six weeks of uncertainty
the WHO, at a press conference the same day, announced the official name for the new illness (as abbreviated) -- 'Covid-19.'

Concurrently the separate international body charged with classifying and naming viruses named the actual causative coronavirus
'SARS-CoV-2' (since it was considered to be a variant of the virus that in 2002–03 caused severe acute respiratory syndrome), but
which name a WHO spokesperson advised Science magazine that WHO would not be using in part out of concern
the word 'SARS' could cause "unnecessary fear"—or, as it was put by the BBC -- "extra panic.
"On
February 11, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expanded a partnership with Janssen Research & Development, a part of Johnson & Johnson, to “expedite the development” of a coronavirus vaccine.
On February 14, the CDC announced it is working with the existing public health department network of community-based influenza surveillance intending to aid in early detection of coronavirus.
From February 12 to 15, three more cases are confirmed, all who travelled from Wuhan, and are similarly quarantined.

On February 15, the government evacuates 338 U.S. nationals stranded aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which had been held in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan.
Fourteen of those repatriated people are infected with the virus.
Five more nationals who were also reported as being infected are evacuated from the ship the following week, and are quarantined at an airbase in California.
Six more cases are subsequently confirmed among those who were evacuated from the cruise ship.
On February 18, HHS announced it would engage with Sanofi Pasteur in an effort to quickly develop a vaccine and treatments against the novel coronavirus.
The New York Times reported that the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Homeland Security, Dr. Duane C. Caneva, continued hosting a series of coronavirus e-mail chains begun in January among a group of infectious disease experts from academia and government.
The group referred to these chains as the "Red Dawn" e-mails, (a movie reference).
On February 17, an e-mail from one participant indicated that the type of social gathering on the Diamond Princess cruise ship wasn't that different from a mall, school, or work environment.
Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions ("NPI") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover.
By the third week of February, the group had "effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation" such as NPI's.
This was based on the "realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms".
For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective.
Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11.
As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools.
Governors began to implement NPI's thereafter, "largely without federal leadership".
On February 20 and 21, two more cases of people who had returned from China are confirmed in California.
The first case of community transmission, because it had no known origin, is confirmed in Solano County, California, on February 26.
A second case of unknown origin is confirmed two days later, also in California, followed by others in Oregon and Washington state.
On February 22, a U.N. WHO team of international specialists from the U.S., Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea arrives in Wuhan city.
By Mid-February, the U.S. was testing about a hundred samples per day.
Researchers concluded in late February that "the virus had probably been spreading for weeks" person-to-person.
The CDC test initially used three genetic sequences or "probes", but sometime after February 24, directed states to use a workaround of using two of the three probes and evaluating them locally.
As of February 23,  fourteen COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed from six states:  Arizona -1 case,  California -8, Illinois -2, and Massachusetts, Washington, and Wisconsin, 1 case each).

Twelve of the cases were related to travel to China, and two occurred through person-to-person transmission from close household contacts with confirmed COVID-19.

An additional 39 cases were reported among repatriated U.S. citizens, residents, and their families returning from Hubei province China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was docked in Yokohama, Japan.

Airport screening by then totaled 46,016 travelers of which 11 had been referred to a hospital with one testing positive, isolated, and managed medically.
Seventeen had been quarantined because of travel from Hubei Province with 4 remaining.
(
The CDC would later have to conclude after months of further experience involving  more than 700,000 screenings that temperature and symptom-based entry screening was ineffective likely due to multiple factors including an overall low COVID-19 prevalence in travelers, the relatively long incubation period, illness presentation with a wide range of severity, afebrile cases, nonspecific symptoms common to other infections, asymptomatic infections, and travelers who might deny symptoms or take steps to avoid detection of illness (e.g., through use of antipyretic or cough suppressant medications).On February 24, President Trump tweeted: "The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA ...
CDC and World Health [Organization] have been working hard and very smart.
"On
February 24, Speaker Pelosi, when asked if people should stay away from San Francisco's Chinatown stated: "That’s what we’re trying to do today is to say everything is fine here, Pelosi said.
Come because precautions have been taken.

"On
February 25, HHS Secretary Azar testified before the U.S. Senate.
National Geographic summarized his testimony, reporting that "the Strategic National Stockpile has just 30 million surgical masks and 12 million [N95] respirators in reserve."
An additional 300 million of each could be required to protect health workers.
HHS said it intended to purchase as many as half a billion respirators and surgical face masks over the next year and a half.
National Geographic concluded that the "U.S. has only a fraction of the medical supplies it needs to combat coronavirus.
"On
February 25, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, delivered a briefing indicating that "disruption to everyday life might be severe."
The New York Times reported that President Trump was "furious", and HHS Secretary Azar attempted downplay her comments in a news conference later that day.
On February 26 at a news conference, President Trump said: "When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."

The next day Dr. Redfield of the CDC testified to a House committee that "as of February 26, 2020 14 cases have been reported across 6 states, and 45 cases have been detected among people repatriated from Hubei, China and the Diamond Princess
We expect to see additional imported cases and limited person- to-person spread.
While community-wide transmission has not been documented yet in the United States, it is expected, and we are aggressively preparing for it.”

He added: “Most cases of COVID-19 in the United States have been associated with travel from China, but some person-to-person spread among close contacts of travelers has been seen.
It’s important to note that this virus is not spreading within American communities at this time.”

The evolving understanding at that time by CDC/NIH experts was also expressed in a February 28 New England Journal of Medicine online editorial regarding the just published observations from Wuhan on the first several hundred cases which appeared to indicate that as an illness Covid-19  would be more akin to a severe seasonal influenza or a pandemic influenza rather than SARS or MERS, but of concern in being more efficient in transmission, as well as having comparatively increased infectivity when symptoms were minimal.
On February 26, Vice-President Mike Pence was appointed to lead the Coronavirus Task Force, replacing HHS Secretary Azar as the group's leader.
Pence was the first official from within Trump's White House to coordinate the planning and response, two months after the government became aware of the coronavirus.
On February 28, the CDC revised its faulty test for COVID-19.On February 29, the first death from coronavirus in the U.S. was reported at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Washington, followed by two other confirmed cases in a nursing home in the same city.
(
Later, it would be reported that the first U.S. death had actually occurred on February 6.)
On February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency for the State of Washington.
New cases continued to show up in California and Illinois.
The Food and Drug Administration began loosening rules that had restricted labs from developing their own coronavirus tests.

COVID-19 vaccination in Australia began on Monday 22 February  2021, and will continue throughout the year with the goal of vaccinating all willing Australians before 2022.
Front-line workers and aged care staff and residents will be the first Australians to be inoculated, before a gradual phased release to less-vulnerable and lower-risk population groups throughout 2021.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved two vaccines in Australia: the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine on 25 January, and the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine on 16 February.
As of 27 April 2021, Australia has administered 1,969,337 vaccine doses across the country.

==
Vaccine approval ==
The two vaccines currently approved for administration in Australia are classified as being "provisionally approved", meaning that they have been deemed safe and effective based on clinical and scientific data and are in the process of non-expiring registration.
The authorisation means the vaccine will become part of the Australian Therapeutic Goods Register and will be up for review again in two years based on additional clinical data.
Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine
Oxford–
AstraZeneca vaccine

COVID-19 vaccine national rollout phases ===
On 21 February 2021, a day before the previously announced program start date, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, Chief Nurse Alison McMillan, and "a small group" of aged care staff and residents became the first Australians to receive the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine.
The early vaccination was heavily televised with the hopes of reassuring Australians about the quality, efficacy, and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.
On 22 February, the first Canberran received a COVID-19 vaccination.
She was a 22-year-old registered nurse, and a member of a COVID-19 testing team.
On 22 March, Health Minister Greg Hunt announced the start of the phase-1b vaccination roll-out.
In this phase, more than 6 million Australians are targeted for inoculation, and approximate 1,000 GP clinics are participating in vaccination all over the nation to ramp up the speed of vaccination.
The government of Australia has decided to prioritise the people who are 50 years or old for vaccination and will be eligible to get jab on 3 May 2021 from General Practice Respiratory Clinics and state and territory vaccination clinics.
Moreover, from 17 May people over 50 can also do their vaccination from selected participating GP clinics.
Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation also advised the government to reserve the Pfizer vaccine for under 50, and the AstraZeneca vaccine will be administered for phase 2a.
===
Distribution ===
The federal government has promised to provide free vaccinations to everyone living in Australia, largely regardless of immigration status.
Like most vaccines, Australians will not need a prescription to receive them.

The person had a history of anaphylaxis and was discharged after full recovery on the same day.
A 44-year-old Victorian man was admitted to Melbourne's Box Hill Hospital on 2  April 2021 when he developed serious thrombosis and a low platelet count after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine on 22  March.
He developed blood clots in his spleen, liver and gut.
Similar cases had been reported overseas among those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine (30 cases in the UK alone) but none among those who had received the Pfizer vaccine.
Canada and Germany had already suspended the use of AstraZeneca for people under the age of 55 and 60-years, respectively.
It was estimated that this occurred in somewhere between one in 100,000 and one in a million recipients.
This prompted the TGA to warn anyone who experienced persistent headaches or other worrying symptoms 4 to 20 days after receiving the vaccine to seek medical advice.
After the latest finding and advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine by UK and EU, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and the TGA had a meeting on 8 April to review and advise the government about the concerns of the vaccine.
Chef medical officer reassured the safety of the vaccine but being reviewed and other vaccine options like Pfizer and Novavax (expected in mid-2021) for the nation.
ATAGI advised the federal government to use the AstraZeneca vaccine only for over 50-years-of-age as they confirmed the very rare side-effect of blood clotting could occur in young persons.
So, the health department confirmed the new timeline of the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout.
All people aged over 50-years were encouraged to take the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The second case of blood clotting in a Western Australian woman in her 40s was linked in mid-April to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
In the third case of blood clotting, a 48-year-old New South Wales woman died in John Hunter Hospital on 15 April after developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 4 days after being vaccinated on 8  April.
The TGA confirmed the "likely" possibility her death was linked to the AstraZeneca vaccination.
They confirmed that the woman had diabetes and had other underlying medical conditions.
A fourth case of blood clotting, reported in Brisbane, is believed to be linked to the Pfizer vaccine.
A 40-year older man received the vaccine on 18 April and was admitted to a private hospital three days later.
According to the health department, investigations are underway to confirm the link between the vaccine and clotting.
Three more cases of blood clotting reported on 23 April are believed to be linked with AstraZeneca vaccination.
A 49-year-old Queensland man, an 80-year-old Victorian man and 35-year-old NSW woman all had suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).
The TGA said there was a "likely link" as all three had received the AstraZeneca vaccine.
All were in a stable condition and recovering.

Vaccination timeline criticisms ==
On 11 March 2021, the Australian Medical Association attested that it was implausible that the government's target of offering vaccination to every Australian by October 2021 would be achieved and suggested that mid-December 2021 would be a more realistic date.
The government had aimed to administer 60,000 doses by the end of February but ended up administering only 31,000 doses.
The Australian vaccination program was 85% behind its target figure by the end of March, whereby 4 million doses were targeted by the Health Department before rollout but only 670,000 had been delivered.
The Australian vaccination rollout had a further setback when pharmacists postponed joining the vaccination program until June.
The federal government said that the EU blocked the shipment of more than 3 million doses of vaccine to Australia is a major reason for the delayed vaccine rollout, although the EU only officially confirmed the export blocking of only 250,000 doses in early March.
The advisory discouraging the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on people under the age of 50 proved a major setback in the vaccination rollout, given it was originally slated as the cornerstone of the entire rollout.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated at the time that a definitive timeline for vaccine rollout could no longer be provided, and there is a need to re-evaluate and recalibrate the program.
On 11 April 2021, PM Scott Morrison conceded COVID-19 vaccination's target set earlier to vaccinate all Australians by the end of this year is difficult to achieve.
He also said there is no set target for the vaccine rollout timeline due to many uncertainties involved.
PM
Morrison suggested two meetings of the National cabinet per week can be held until the issues of vaccine rollout are fixed.

===
History ===
On 1 December 2020, the Government of Ireland approved an advance purchase agreement for 875,000 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
On 15 December, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced the Government's National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, which outlines the country's high-level plan for safe, effective and efficient vaccination of the Republic of Ireland, while safeguarding continued provision of health and social care services.

===
Timeline ===
On St Stephen's Day, the first shipment of 10,000 Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines arrived in the country.
Annie Lynch, a 79-year-old woman, became the first person in the Republic of Ireland to receive the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine at St. James's Hospital, Dublin on 29 December 2020, and received the second dose three weeks later on Tuesday 19 January 2021.Maura
Byrne, a 95-year-old woman, became the first nursing home resident in the Republic of Ireland to receive the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine on 5 January 2021, while Dr Eavan Muldoon, an infectious diseases consultant, became the first healthcare worker in the Mater University Hospital to receive the vaccine.
On the same day, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced that up to 135,000 people would be vaccinated nationwide by the end of February 2021.Following
the approval of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine by the European Medicines Agency on 6 January 2021
, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar announced that the vaccine would allow 10,000 more people in Ireland to be vaccinated per week.
The rollout of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine in private and voluntary nursing homes began nationwide on 7 January, with 22 nursing homes of 3,000 residents and staff to be vaccinated.
The first shipment of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Republic of Ireland on 12 January.
Around 1,800 healthcare workers received the Moderna vaccine at three mass vaccination centres that opened in Dublin, Galway and Portlaoise on 16 January.
On 17 January, the Government requested early deliveries of the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine as discussions to secure early delivery of the vaccine got underway.
The first shipment of 21,600 AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in the country on 6 February.
On 24 February, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced that Ireland had ordered enough vaccines to vaccinate 10.3 million people with 18.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines ordered.
On 6 March, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced that Ireland had reached the milestone of half a million COVID-19 vaccines administered.
On 10 March, Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed that Ireland was to receive a further 46,500 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine before the end of March.
On 14 March, the administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was suspended in Ireland by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) as a precautionary measure following concerns over serious blood clots in Norway.
On 19 March, the NIAC recommended that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine could continue to be used in Ireland following approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 18 March.
On 8 April, the CEO of the Health Service Executive (HSE)
Paul Reid announced that Ireland had reached the milestone of one million COVID-19 vaccines administered.
On the same day, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) began an investigation after the first case of a very rare blood clot in the brain of a person after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine was confirmed in a 40-year-old Dublin woman.
On 12 April, following a lengthy meeting, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommend that only people over 60 years of age should get the AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine and that a second dose of the vaccine should not be given to anyone who developed unusual blood clots with low platelets after the first dose.
On 15 April, over 26,000 people registered for a COVID-19 vaccination after the online portal for 69-year-olds went live.
On 25 April, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced that Ireland had reached the milestone of one million first doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered.
===
Vaccines on order ===


==
Organisations involved ==
A High-Level Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccination was established on 11 November 2020 to oversee the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in the country once they were approved by the statutory authorities, and to support the Department of Health and Health Service Executive (HSE) to deliver a COVID-19 immunisation programme that meets best practice and provides good governance.
The first full meeting of the task force took place on 23 November 2020 and was chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith.
The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (an independent body outside of the HSE) provides expert, evidence-based and impartial guidance about the COVID-19 vaccines to the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health.

===
Members of the Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccination ===
Members of the High-Level Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccination is made up of senior representatives from the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Office of Government Procurement, IDA Ireland, the Dublin Airport Authority, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Taoiseach.

==
Rollout schedule ==


===
Phases ===
Under the Government's National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, the vaccines will be rolled out in three phases:


===
Vaccine priority groups ===
The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy currently includes 9 priority groups for the vaccine rollout in Ireland.
On 23 February, following the publication of the Government's new revised Living with COVID-19 plan called "The Path Ahead", Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced an update to the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy with people aged between 16 and 69 who are at very high risk of developing severe COVID-19 moved up the priority list, after the National Public Health Emergency Team endorsed recommendations by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.
On 30 March, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced an update to the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy with priority groups being changed to an age-based system after vulnerable people with underlying conditions were vaccinated.

"People who have an underlying condition that puts them at high risk of severe disease and death" is defined as:
People with cancer
Haematological – within 1 year
Haematological – within 1–5 years
Non-haematological – within 1 year
All other cancers on non-hormonal treatment
People with chronic heart (and vascular) disease (e.g. heart failure, hypertensive cardiac disease)
People with chronic kidney disease with eGFR <30ml/min
People with chronic liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis or fibrosis)
People with chronic neurological disease or condition (e.g. Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy.

People with chronic respiratory disease (e.g. stable cystic fibrosis, severe asthma (continuous or repeated use of systemic corticosteroids), moderate COPD)
People with diabetes (Type 1 and 2)
People who are immunocompromised due to disease or treatment (e.g. high dose systemic steroids, persons living with HIV)
People with inherited metabolic diseases
People with intellectual disability (excluding Down syndrome)
People who are obese (BMI >35 Kg/m2)
People with severe mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression)


== Progress to date ==


==
Vaccination centres ==
Up to 40 large vaccination centres were put in place across the country to administer COVID-19 vaccines.
Major facilities were put in place in Cork, Dublin, Waterford, Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Athlone, with smaller centres in Mullingar, Longford, Ennis, Nenagh, Bantry and Tralee.
Three GP-run vaccination centres were also put in place across the country, with The Helix at Dublin City University
the first to be established, vaccinating 5,000 people a day.
Cork City Hall, Páirc Uí Chaoimh GAA grounds and Munster Technological University's Bishopstown campus were transformed into mass vaccination centres, administering 10,000 shots a day.
Large venues such as sports stadia, GAA clubs, hotels, conference centres and arenas were used as mass vaccination centres across all counties in Ireland.

=== Locations ===
On 15 February, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly confirmed locations for 37 vaccination centres across all counties as part of the country's COVID-19 vaccination programme.
On 20 February, nearly 1,000 patients over the age of 85 received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at the country's first mass vaccination centre at The Helix in Dublin City University.

==
Controversies ==
On 26 March, the Labour Party leader Alan Kelly called for the chief executive of the Beacon Hospital to resign after it gave 20 leftover COVID-19 vaccines to a number of teachers and staff at a private secondary school in Bray, County Wicklow on 23 March.
One day later on 27 March, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly requested the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccine operations at the Beacon Hospital following the controversy.
On 30 March, a decision by the Government to overhaul the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to an age-based system sparked anger and concern among teachers' unions and key workers.
The new change meant that key workers in essential jobs and the education sector who couldn't avoid a high risk of exposure to the virus would lose vaccine prioritisation.
Ireland's largest teaching union, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO), strongly criticised moves to change the vaccination rollout plan stating it was "extremely concerned" by the news, while the Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI) echoed concerns and called for urgent engagement with the Department of Education.
The Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI) stated it was "shocked and dismayed" by the changes and claimed the decision was "totally at odds" with the objective to keep schools open, while the president of the Garda Representative Association (GRA) described the change as "a sucker punch" to their members, and that the decision "downgraded" the work of Gardaí and disregarded the risks they took while policing the pandemic.
On 7 April, the three teacher unions voted for an emergency motion backing industrial action, up to and including strike action, if they were not prioritised for vaccination.
On 1 April, an independent review of the COVID-19 vaccination programme at the Coombe Hospital found that a consultant brought two leftover vaccine doses home to administer them to two family members.

COVID-19 Vaccine
Ireland's COVID-19 Data Hub – Vaccinations
The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 29 April 2021, more than 149 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.15 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe.
Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.
Small droplets containing the virus leave an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enter another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes.
Airborne transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller infected droplets can linger in the air for minutes to hours within enclosed spaces that have inadequate ventilation.
Less commonly, the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces.
People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.
Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.
Several vaccines have been developed and widely distributed since December 2020.
Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns/quarantines, workplace hazard controls, and business closures.
Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.
The pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.
It has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption and food shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.
Numerous educational institutions and public areas have been partially or fully closed, and many events have been cancelled or postponed.
Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media.
The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights.

==
Epidemiology ==


===
Background ===
Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown, the first outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China in late 2019.
Many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease "COVID-19", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2)
, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Scientific consensus is that COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus that arose from bats in a natural setting, although the exact original host and cross-species infection routes remain in need of further investigation.
Despite this, the subject has generated a significant amount of online conspiracy theories.
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 November.
Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two thirds were found to have a link with the market.
There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.

===
Cases ===
Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.
An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.
Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.
On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.
Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.
Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.
Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.
Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.
It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.
A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).
R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity.
By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.

===
Deaths ===
Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.
These counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.
Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.
Comparisons of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicate excess mortality in many countries.
This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.
The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.
More than 95 percent of the people who contract COVID-19 recover.
Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.
As of 29 April 2021, more than 3.15 million deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
People at the greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as those with a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.
Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.1 percent (3,153,526 deaths for 149,744,454 cases) as of 29 April 2021.
The number varies by region.

====
Reporting ====
On 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, indicated the WHO had provided two codes for COVID-19: U07.1 when confirmed by laboratory testing and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiological diagnosis where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.
The CDC noted that "Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics" and that U07.1 would be used "
If the death certificate reports terms such as 'probable COVID-19' or 'likely COVID-19'.
"
The CDC also noted "It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases" and while the "underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, ... the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not.
"On
16 April 2020, the WHO, in its formal publication of the two codes, U07.1 and U07.2, "recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.
"
It was also noted that the WHO "does not distinguish" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
====
Infection fatality ratio (IFR) ====
A crucial metric in assessing the severity of a disease is the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals (including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections) as measured or estimated as of a specific date.
Epidemiologists frequently refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality rate' to clarify that it is expressed in percentage points (not as a decimal).
Other published studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality
risk'.
In April 2020, an IFR range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed serology surveys, with the upper bound characterised as much more credible and the range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).In June 2020, a peer-reviewed analysis of pre-serology data from mainland China yielded an overall IFR of 0.66% (with age-bracketed values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9 years to 0.595% for 50–59 years to 7.8% for > 80 years).In July 2020, the US CDC adopted the IFR as a "more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19" and computed an overall 'best estimate' for planning purposes for the U.S. of 0.65%.

In August 2020, the WHO reported serology testing for three locations in Europe (with some data through 2 June)
that showed IFR overall estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.
A systematic review article in The BMJ advised that "caution is warranted ... using serological tests for ... epidemiological surveillance" and called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of "RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures."
CEBM researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record "CT lung findings and associated blood tests" and for the WHO to produce a "protocol to standardise the use and interpretation of PCR" with continuous re-calibration.
In September, the CDC computed an age-bracketed 'best estimate' for the U.S. of 0.003% for 0–19 years; 0.02% for 20–49 years; 0.5% for 50–69 years; and 5.4% for 70+ years.
In September 2020, a Bulletin of the World Health Organization article by John Ioannidis estimated the median global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23% overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high mortality) and 0.05% for people < 70 years (a range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic.
On 6 October 2020, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme announced "Our current best estimates tell us that about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus."
Also in October, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) reported a 'presumed estimate' of global IFR at between 0.10% to 0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.
These researchers noted a decrease in IFR in England over time; and, for the UK and Italy (the two European nations worst hit by COVID-19), attribute the rise in daily cases, stability in daily deaths, and shift of cases to a younger population to waning viral circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus mutation.
In November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for a number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%.In December 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the European Journal of Epidemiology estimated that population-weighted IFR was 0.5% to 1% in some countries (France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in several other countries (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and about 2.5% in Italy; these estimates included fatalities in elderly care facilities.
This study also found that most of the differences in IFR across locations reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and the age-specific pattern of infection rates, due to very low IFRs for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher IFRs for older adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).
These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the World Health Organization.

====
Case fatality ratio (CFR) ====
Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (CFR), which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.
This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).
On 4 August, WHO indicated "at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of CFR by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%."

Vaccines ===
On 21 December 2020, the European Union approved the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine.
Vaccinations began to be administered on 27 December 2020.
The Moderna vaccine was authorized on 6 January 2021 and the AstraZeneca vaccine was authorized on 29 January 2021.

On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19, covering "any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID-19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the declaration precludes "liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct".
The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.
On 8 December it was reported that the AstraZeneca vaccine is about 70% effective, according to a study.

===
Treatment ===
There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Thus, the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 is supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.

Most cases of COVID-19 are mild.
In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing.
Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.
People with more severe cases may need treatment in hospital.
In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the risk of death.
Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in clinical trials.
Others were thought to be promising early in the pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found them to be ineffective or even harmful.
Despite ongoing research, there is still not enough high-quality evidence to recommend so-called early treatment.
Nevertheless, in the United States, two monoclonal antibody-based therapies are available for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease.
The antiviral remdesivir is available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to limited evidence of its efficacy.

===
Variants ===
Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged that are spreading globally.
The most currently prevalent, all of which share the D614G mutation, are:
B.1.1.7, first detected in the UK, which has spread to over 70 countries
P.1, first detected in Brazil, which has spread to more than 4 countries
B.1.351, first detected in South Africa, which has spread to over 30 countries
B.1.427, first detected in California, which has spread to 14 countries
B.1.429, first detected in California, which has spread to 25 countries

Prognosis ===


==
Mitigation ==
Speed and scale are key to mitigation, due to the fat-tailed nature of pandemic risk and the exponential growth of COVID-19 infections.
For mitigation to be effective, (a) chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health care must be available to provide for the needs of those infected, and (c) contingencies must be in place to allow for effective rollout of (a) and (b).

===
Screening, containment and mitigation ===
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation.
Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the infection.
Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading.
When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.
Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.

====
Contact tracing ====
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
(
Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)On 10 April 2020
, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.
The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.
In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.

===
Health care ===
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.
On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing.
NASA is seeking fast-track approval.

History ==


=== 2019
===
Based on the retrospective analysis, starting from December 2019, the number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December.
On 24 December 2019, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.
On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.
A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December 2019, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result.
Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January), were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours; and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".
The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases—enough to trigger an investigation.
The following day, on December 31, the WHO learned about a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of an unknown cause in Wuhan.
An investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.According to official Chinese sources, the early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.
However, in May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.
In March 2021, the WHO published their report on the potential zoonotic source of the virus.
The WHO concluded that human spillover via an intermediate animal host was the most likely explanation, with direct spillover from bats next most likely and introduction through the food supply chain as another possible explanation.

=== 2020 ===
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.
On 10 January, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later) and more may have been infected.
A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".
On 31 January The Lancet would publish the first modelling study explicitly warning of inevitable "independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally" and calling for "large-scale public health interventions.
"On 30 January 2020, with 7,818 confirmed cases across 19 countries, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and then a pandemic on 11 March 2020 as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported increasing numbers of cases.

On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.
As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.
On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.
By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.
Research on SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travelers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.
Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019 and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being officially reported, the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.
As of 15 June 2020, 79 cases were officially confirmed.
Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.
On 29 June 2020, WHO warned that the spread of the virus was still accelerating as countries reopened their economies, despite many countries having made progress in slowing down the spread.
On 15 July 2020, one COVID-19 case was officially reported in Dalian in more than three months.
The patient did not travel outside the city in the 14 days before developing symptoms, nor did he have contact with people from "areas of attention.
"In
October 2020
, the WHO stated, at a special meeting of WHO leaders, that one in ten people around the world may have been infected with COVID-19.
At the time, that translated to 780 million people being infected, while only 35 million infections had been confirmed.
In early November 2020, Denmark reported on an outbreak of a unique mutated variant being transmitted to humans from minks in its North Jutland Region.
All twelve human cases of the mutated variant were identified in September 2020.
The WHO released a report saying the variant "had a combination of mutations or changes that have not been previously observed.
"
In response, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ordered for the country – the world's largest producer of mink fur – to cull its mink population by as many as 17 million.
On 9 November 2020, Pfizer released their trial results for a candidate vaccine, showing that it is 90% effective against the virus.
Later that day, Novavax entered an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine.

Virologist and U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
director Anthony Fauci indicated that the Pfizer vaccine targets the spike protein used to infect cells by the virus.
Some issues left to be answered are how long the vaccine offers protection, and if it offers the same level of protection to all ages.
Initial doses will likely go to healthcare workers on the front lines.
On 9 November 2020 the United States surpassed 10 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, making it the country with the most cases worldwide by a large margin.
It was reported on 27 November, that a publication released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the current numbers of viral infection are via confirmed laboratory test only.
However, the true number could be about eight times the reported number; the report further indicated that the true number of virus infected cases could be around 100 million in the U.S.On 14 December 2020, Public Health England reported a new variant had been discovered in the South East of England, predominantly in Kent.
The variant, named Variant of Concern 202012/01, showed changes to the spike protein which could make the virus more infectious.
As of 13 December, there were 1,108 cases identified.
Many countries halted all flights from the UK; France-bound Eurotunnel service was suspended and ferries carrying passengers and accompanied freight were cancelled as the French border closed to people on 20 December.

=== 2021 ===
On 2 January, VOC-202012/01, a variant of SARS-CoV-2 first discovered in the UK, had been identified in 33 countries around the world, including Pakistan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Norway, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, India, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, and China.
On 12 January, it was reported that a team of scientists from the World Health Organization would arrive in Wuhan on the 14th of the month; this is to ascertain the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and determine what were the intermediate hosts between the original reservoir and humans.
On the following day, two of the WHO members were barred from entering China because, according to the country, antibodies for the virus were detected in both.
On 25 January, the Brazil variant was detected in Minnesota.
On 29 January, it was reported that the Novavax vaccine was only 49% effective against the 501.V2 variant in a clinical trial in South Africa.
The China COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac indicated 50.4% effectivity in a Brazil clinical trial.
On 12 March, it was reported that several countries including Thailand, Denmark, Bulgaria, Norway, and Iceland had stopped using the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine due to what was being called severe blood clotting problems, a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
Additionally, Austria halted the use of one batch of the aforementioned vaccine as well.
On 20 March, the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link between thrombus (a blood clot of clinical importance), leading several European countries to resume administering the AstraZeneca vaccine.
On 29 March, it was reported that the U.S. government was planning to introduce COVID-19 vaccination 'passports' to allow those who have been vaccinated the ability to board airplanes, cruise ships as well as other activities.
As of 29 April 2021, more than 149 million cases have been reported worldwide due to COVID-19; more than 3.15 million have died and more than 86.9 million have recovered.

==
National responses ==
A total of 192 countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).
The WHO's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted.
To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the long-term responses to the pandemic should consist of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.
By 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.
By late April 2020, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.
Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, around 100 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.

===
Asia ===
As of 30 April 2020, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases.
Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly Bhutan, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam has allowed them to fare comparatively well.
China was criticised for initially minimising the severity of the outbreak, but its wide-scale response has largely contained the disease since March 2020.
As of 29 January 2021, Singapore has the lowest case fatality rate in the world at
<0.1%.The pandemic has had direct side effects, per a report on 28 November, in Japan.
According to the report by the country's National Police Agency, suicides had increased to 2,153 in October.
Experts also state that the pandemic has worsened mental health issues due to lockdowns and isolation from family members, among other issues.

====
China ====
As of 14 July 2020, there are 83,545 cases confirmed in China— excluding 114 asymptomatic cases, 62 of which were imported, under medical observation; asymptomatic cases have not been reported prior to 31 March 2020—with 4,634 deaths and 78,509 recoveries, meaning there are only 402 cases.
Hubei has the most cases, followed by Xinjiang.
By March 2020, COVID-19 infections have largely been put under control in China, with minor outbreaks since.
It was reported on 25 November, that some 1 million people in the country of China have been vaccinated according to China's state council; the vaccines against COVID-19 come from Sinopharm which makes two and one produced by Sinovac.

====
India ====
The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020.
India ordered a nationwide lockdown for the entire population starting 24 March 2020, with a phased unlock beginning 1 June 2020.
Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country—Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.
On 10 June 2020, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.
On 30 August 2020, India surpassed the US record for the most cases in a single day, with more than 78,000 cases, and set a new record on 16 September 2020, with almost 98,000 cases reported that day.
As of 30 August 2020, India's case fatality rate is relatively low at 2.3%, against the global 4.7%.As of September 2020, India had the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia; and the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world, behind the United States, with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May 2020, 1,000,000 on 16 July 2020, and 5,000,000 confirmed cases on 16 September 2020.On 19 December 2020, India crossed the total number of 10,000,000 confirmed cases but with a slow pace.
The Indian Ministry of Science initiated a mathematical simulation of the pandemic, the so-called "Indian Supermodel", which correctly predicted the decrease of active cases starting in September
2020.A second wave hit India in April 2021, placing healthcare services under severe strain.
By late April, the government was reporting over 300,000 new infections and 2,000 deaths per day, with concerns of undercounting.

====
Iran ====
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people had died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, Friday prayers, and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran allocated 5 trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000) to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020
there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March 2020, although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year
Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March.
Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China in February 2020.
More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March 2020.
On 15 March 2020, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March 2020.
By 23 March 2020, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to COVID-19.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.
On 20 April 2020, Iran reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country.
After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June 2020, raising fear of a second wave.
On 18 July 2020, President Rouhani estimated that 25 million Iranians had already become infected, which is considerably higher than the official count.
Leaked data suggest that 42,000 people had died with COVID-19 symptoms by 20 July 2020, nearly tripling the 14,405 officially reported by that date.

====
South Korea ====
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.
By 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms.
South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 29 February, more than 3,150 confirmed cases were reported.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.
Airline schedules were also changed.
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.
Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day, and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
Despite some early criticisms of President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis, South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Persistent local groups of infections in the greater Seoul area continued to be found, which led to Korea's CDC director saying in June that the country had entered the second wave of infections, although a WHO official disagreed with that assessment.

===
Europe ===
On 21 August, it was reported the COVID-19 cases were climbing among younger individuals across Europe.
On 21 November, it was reported by the Voice of America that Europe is the worst hit area by the COVID-19 virus, with numbers exceeding 15 million cases.

====
France ====
Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.
A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.
On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places, and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until
11 May. As of 14 September, France has reported more than 402,000 confirmed cases, 30,000 deaths, and 90,000 recoveries, ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.
In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.
On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.
On 12 November, it was reported that France had become the worst-hit country by the COVID-19 pandemic, in all of Europe, in the process surpassing Russia.
The new total of confirmed cases was more than 1.8 million and counting; additionally it was indicated by the French government that the current national lockdown would remain in place.

====
Italy ====
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February 2020.

On 22 February 2020, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided.
Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas.
"On 4 March 2020
, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths.
All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March 2020, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.
On 6 March 2020, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.
On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most COVID-19-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.
On 22 March 2020, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 28 March, there were 3,532,057 confirmed cases, 107,933 deaths, and 2,850,889 recoveries in Italy, with a large number of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.
On 19 April 2020, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses were asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.

On 13 October 2020, the Italian government again issued restrictive rules to contain a rise in infections.
On 11 November, it was reported that Silvestro Scotti, president of the Italian Federation of General Practitioners indicated that all of Italy should come under restrictions due to the spread of COVID-19.
A couple of days prior Filippo Anelli, president of the National Federation of Doctor's Guilds (FNOMCEO) asked for a complete lockdown of the peninsular nation due to the pandemic.
On the 10th, a day before, Italy surpassed 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases.
On 23 November, it was reported that the second wave of the virus has caused some hospitals in Italy to stop accepting patients.

====
Spain ====


====
Sweden ====
Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.
Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favoured forgoing a lockdown.
The Swedish strategy focused on measures that could be put in place over a longer period of time, based on the assumption that the virus would start spreading again after a shorter lockdown.
The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.
On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.
In the end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality.

====
United Kingdom ====
Devolution in the United Kingdom meant that each of the four countries of the UK had its own different response to COVID-19, and the UK government, on behalf of England, moved quicker to lift restrictions.
The UK government started enforcing social distancing and quarantine measures on 18 March 2020 and was criticised for a perceived lack of intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government ordered all leisure establishments to close as soon as possible, and promised to prevent unemployment.
On 23 March, Johnson banned gatherings of multiple people and restricting non-essential travel and outdoor activity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings.
Most non-essential businesses were ordered to close.
On 24 April, it was reported that a promising vaccine trial had begun in England; the government pledged more than £50 million towards research.
A number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.
The first operating was the 4,000-bed NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed for over nine days.
On 4 May, it was announced that it would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities; 51 patients had been treated in the first three weeks.
On 16 April, it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.
On 2 December, the UK became the first Western country to approve the Pfizer vaccine against the COVID-19 virus; 800,000 doses would be immediately available for use.
It was reported on 5 December that the United Kingdom would begin vaccination against the virus on 8 December, less than a week after having been approved.
On 9 December, MHRA stated that any individual with a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, such as an anaphylactoid reaction, should not take the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19 protection.

Brazil ====
On 20 May, it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities.
With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.
On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths.
President Jair Bolsonaro has created controversy by referring to the virus as a "little flu" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines.
His attitude towards the outbreak has been likened to that of former U.S. President Trump, with Bolsonaro being called the "Trump of the Tropics".
Bolsonaro later tested positive for the virus.
In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths.
On 5 June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths.
The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of the previous 24 hours.
The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths.
On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.
Brazil briefly paused Phase III trials for the Coronavac COVID-19 vaccine on 10 November after the suicide of a volunteer before resuming on 11 November.
By early 2021, the death toll had climbed to 231,534.
The total number of cases on 7 February exceeded 9.5 million.
The only countries with worse outbreaks were India and the United States.

International responses ==
The COVID-19 pandemic shook the world's economy, with especially severe economic damage in the United States, Europe, and Latin America.
A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April 2021 concluded, "Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally, as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized groups."
Furthermore, COVID-19 has inflamed partisanship and polarization around the world as bitter arguments explode over who to scapegoat and who to help first.
The risks include further disruption of international trade and the formation of no-entry enclaves.

===
Travel restrictions ===
As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas, or for all travellers.
Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector.
Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.
A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.
Researchers concluded that "travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late".
The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy, a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.

===
Evacuation of foreign citizens ===
Owing to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.
Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.
On 14 March 2020, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.
Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.
On 15 February 2020, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.
On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

===
United Nations response measures ===
The United Nations response to the pandemic has been led by its Secretary-General and can be divided into formal resolutions at the General Assembly and the Security Council (UNSC), and operations via its specialised agencies.
In June 2020, the Secretary-General launched its 'UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19'.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNSC) has been criticised for a slow coordinated response, especially regarding the UN's global ceasefire, which aims to open up humanitarian access to the world's most vulnerable in conflict zones.

====
WHO response measures ====


===
Protests against governmental measures ===
In several countries, protests have risen against governmental restrictive responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lockdowns.
A February 2021 study found that large protest rallies against coronavirus measures are likely to directly increase the spread of viruses including the coronavirus.

Impact ==


===
Economics ===
The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes.
One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China.
On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08) and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook.
Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.
Lloyd's of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season and 11 September attacks, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.

Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel.
Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The cruise line industry was hard hit, and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.
The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent.
North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop.
This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.

Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally.
More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims.
The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating between 30 and 40 million Americans are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020.
According to a report by Yelp, about 60% of U.S. businesses that have closed since the start of the pandemic will stay shut permanently.
According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.
According to the World Bank, up to 100 million more people globally could fall into extreme poverty due to the shutdowns.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) informed that the income generated in the first nine months of 2020 from work across the world dropped by 10.7 per cent, or $3.5 trillion, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.

====
Supply shortages ====
The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.
The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust).
The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.
According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.
The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was worldwide.
The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine.
The Yuancheng Group, headquartered in Wuhan, is one of the leading suppliers.
Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the streets of the UK.
U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors.
The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis.
David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said "we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months."
Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve, for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020.

====
Oil and other energy markets ====
In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.
June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.
===
Culture ===
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally.
Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.
By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.

Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The 2020 Hajj was limited to around 1,000 selected pilgrims, in contrast to the usual number of over 2 million.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020,
2019–20 NBA season, 2019–20 NHL season, and 2020 Arctic Winter Games.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, which were originally scheduled to start at 24 July 2020, and were postponed by the International Olympic Committee to 23 July
2021.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in May, was cancelled; however, the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021.
Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work.
The large number of people working or learning from home via videoconferencing software led to several new terms and trends, including "Zoom fatigue", a decline in demand for formal clothing, and increased fashion focus on masks and clothes for the upper body (the lower body generally not being visible on a videoconference).
The term "doomscrolling" became more widely used.
Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.
A popular Twitter account called "Room Rater" jokingly commented on and assigned numerical scores to the backgrounds of journalists and others appearing in mass media from home.

===
Politics ===
The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities, isolations or deaths of multiple politicians, and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.
Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus, although research has determined that they were not.
Although they have broad support among epidemiologists, social distancing measures have been politically controversial in many countries.
Intellectual opposition to social distancing has come primarily from writers of other fields, although there are a few heterodox epidemiologists.
On 23 March 2020, United Nations Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres issued an appeal for a global ceasefire in response to the pandemic; 172 UN Member States and Observers signed a non-binding statement in support of the appeal in June, and the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting it in July.

====
China ====
The government of China has been criticised by the United States, the UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and others for its handling of the pandemic.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine measures in China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak.
Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect CCP general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.
The U.S. intelligence community claims China intentionally under-reported its number of COVID-19 cases.
The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.
However, journalists and activists who have reported on the pandemic have been detained by authorities, such as Zhang Zhan, who was arrested and tortured for reporting on the pandemic and the detainment of other independent journalists.

====
Italy ====
In early March, the Italian government criticised the EU's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy—Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said "only China responded bilaterally", not the EU.
On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."

In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant, and Ursula von der
Leyen offered an official apology to the country.

====
United States ====
The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts believe it may have contributed to Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election.
Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.
Simultaneously, protests ensued by essential workers in the form of a general strike.
In early October 2020, Donald Trump, his family members, and many other government officials were diagnosed with COVID-19, further disrupting the country's politics.

====
Other countries ====
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, was held on a reduced scale.
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying "it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating.
"The
Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.
Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.
Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
In some countries, including Egypt, Turkey, and Thailand, opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.
In India, journalists criticising the government's response were arrested or issued warnings by police and authorities.
Rates of imprisoned or detained journalists increased worldwide, with some being related to the pandemic.
The government of the UK faced criticism after the now-former Chief of Staff Dominic Cummings was discovered multiple times breaking lockdown.

===
Agriculture and food systems ===
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted agricultural and food systems worldwide.
COVID-19 hit at a time when hunger or undernourishment was once again on the rise in the world, with an estimated 690 million people already going hungry in 2019.
Based on the latest UN estimates, the economic recession triggered by the pandemic may lead to another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.
This is mainly due to a lack of access to food – linked to falling incomes, lost remittances and, in some cases, a rise in food prices.
In countries that already suffer from high levels of acute food insecurity, it is no longer an issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food production.
The pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production.
As a result, several famines are forecast, which the UN called a crisis "of biblical proportions," or "hunger pandemic.
"
It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that "12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger" by the end of 2020.

This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019–2021 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way.

55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario.
265 million people are forecast to be in famine conditions, an increase of 125 million due to the pandemic.

Environment and climate ===


===
Xenophobia and racism ===
Heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East and Southeast Asian descent.
Reports from February 2020 (when most confirmed cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus.
Chinese people and other Asian peoples in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump was criticised for referring to the COVID-19 as the "Chinese Virus" and "Kung Flu", which has been condemned as racist and xenophobic.
On 14 March, an Asian family, including a two-year-old girl, was attacked at knifepoint in Texas in what the FBI has called a COVID-19 related hate crime.
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia, as were people from hotspots in other countries.
Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.
As of late April 2020, Paris had seen riots break out over police treatment of marginalised ethnic groups during the then in-place lockdown.
Racism and xenophobia towards South Asian groups increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.
South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.
In China, some people of African descent  were evicted from their homes and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.
This policy was criticised by some foreign governments, diplomatic corps, and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.

===
Lifestyle change adaptation during the pandemic ===
The pandemic has resulted in many people adapting to massive changes in life, from increased internet commerce activity to the job market.
Social distancing has caused increased sales from large e-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Coupang.
Online retailers in the US posted 791.70 billion dollars in sales in 2020, an increase of 32.4% from 598.02 billion dollars from the year before.
The trend of home delivery orders have increased due to the pandemic, with indoor dining restaurants shutting down due to lockdown orders or low sales.
Hackers and cybercriminals/scammers have started targeting people due to the massive changes, with some pretending to be part of the CDC, and others using different phishing schemes.
Education worldwide has increasingly shifted from physical attendance to video conferencing apps such as Zoom as lockdown measures have resulted in schools being forced to shut down.
Due to the pandemic, mass layoffs have occurred in the airline, travel, hospitality, and some other industries.
(
There is no sign of a permanent recovery as of March 2021.)

Information dissemination ==
Ongoing COVID-19 research is indexed and searchable in the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio.
Some newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their COVID-19-related articles and posts, while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.
Maps have played a key role in disseminating information concerning the spatial distribution of the disease, especially with the development of dashboards to present data in near real-time.
Methods of data visualisation have drawn some criticism, however, in the over-simplification of geographical patterns indicated by choropleth maps that adopt national, rather than local, map scales.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Metro Manila is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus reached Metro Manila on January 30, 2020, when the first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed in Manila.
Metro Manila is the worst affected region in the Philippines, where most cases are recorded, and is considered as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
A state of calamity and community quarantine have been in place in the region since March 15.After a month of no new cases in the country, the first case of someone without travel history abroad was confirmed on March 5, a 62-year-old male who frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan, Metro Manila, raising suspicions that a community transmission of COVID-19 is already underway in the Philippines.
The man's wife was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 on March 7, which was also the first local transmission to be confirmed.
As of April 24, 2021, there have been 438,484 confirmed cases of the disease in Metro Manila.
Out of these cases, 393,588 have already recovered, while 6,155 died.
==
Background ==
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was recorded in Metro Manila on January 30, 2020.
It involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, the origin of the disease, who arrived in Manila after travelling to Cebu City and Dumaguete in central Philippines from Hong Kong.
Three days later, the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that a second Chinese national tested positive for COVID-19, identified as the 44-year-old male companion of the first confirmed patient.

Both patients received treatment at Manila's San Lazaro Hospital with the latter being reported to have died from the disease on February 2, becoming the first known fatality outside China.
On March 6, the DOH reported the first case of local community transmission of the deadly virus, a 62-year-old Filipino man from suburban Cainta, Rizal, just east of Metro Manila, with no prior travel history to affected countries.
He and his 59-year-old Filipino wife were initially admitted to the Cardinal Santos Medical Center in San Juan where they were diagnosed with the virus before being transferred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa where they both died on March 11.On March 12, 2020, following the declaration of a public health emergency, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire capital region under community quarantine for 30 days starting March 15, 2020.
Most areas in Metro Manila have also issued curfews to help limit the spread of the virus.
On March 16, an enhanced community quarantine order was issued by the president covering Metro Manila and the entire island of Luzon.
On April 7, DOH secretary Francisco Duque reported that Metro Manila's COVID-19 cases continued to rise as 80 percent of the country's 3,764 confirmed cases were from the region.
Duque also identified the cities with the most number of cases by the third week of the mass quarantine: Quezon City with 583, Manila with 221, Makati with 160,
Parañaque with 155, and San Juan with 134 confirmed cases.
The cities with the most reported deaths so far were identified as Quezon City with 34, Manila with 30, San Juan with 24, Pasig with 15, and Caloocan and Parañaque with 14 fatalities each.
On the same day, President Duterte announced that the Luzon-wide quarantine measures have been extended to April 30.
It was further extended up to May 15.
A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was then applied to NCR, Laguna, and Cebu City afterwards, while GCQ was raised to 41 provinces and 10 cities with moderate risk.

2020 ===
====
January–February 2020
– first cases ====
The first suspected case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was reported in January 2020.
The case was that of a 5-year-old boy in Cebu, who arrived in the country on January 12 with his mother.
At that time, the Philippines has no capability to conduct tests to confirm suspected COVID-19 cases.
The boy tested positive for "non-specific pancoronavirus assay" by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, and samples from the boy were sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing to determine the specific coronavirus strain.
The boy tested negative for COVID-19 but several suspected cases were reported in various parts of the country.
The RITM developed capability to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-19 cases.
It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30.
On the same day, the Philippines confirms its first case of COVID-19 in Metro Manila and the entire country, a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 21.
She was hospitalized at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.
She sought a consultation due to a mild cough, and was already asymptomatic at the time of the announcement.
The second case was confirmed on February 2, a 44-year-old Chinese man who was the companion of the first case.
His death on February 1 was the first recorded outside China.
He suffered from coinfection with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

====
March 2020 –
early spread ====
On March 6, the first case of community transmission is reported by the DOH, a 62-year-old Filipino man from nearby Cainta, Rizal, with no known history of travel abroad and who regularly visited a Muslim prayer hall in Greenhills, San Juan.
The next day, on March 7, Taguig records its first COVID-19 case, a lawyer who works at Bonifacio Global City and has a history abroad of travelling to Japan.

Alphacoronavirus 1 is a species of coronavirus that infects cats, dogs and pigs.
It includes species earlier described as Feline coronavirus, Canine coronavirus and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus.
It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus and able to enter its host cell by binding to the APN receptor.
It was first recognised as a virus that caused transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs in 1965.
It was originally named Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus in 1976.
After subsequent discovery of Canine coronavirus in dogs and Feline coronavirus in cats, the three viruses were merged into a single species in 2009.

==
Discovery ==
In the mid-1940s there was an outbreak of pig disease in US, called transmissible gastroenteritis, which was characterised mainly by diarrhoea and vomiting.
It was suspected to be a viral infection and was highly fatal among young pigs.
Leo P. Doyle and L. M. Hutchings reported the case in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in 1946.
The virus was identified and isolated by A. W. McClurkin in 1965.
The International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (ICNV, later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, in 1975) accepted the scientific named Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine in its first report in 1971, but renamed it Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (PTGV) in its second report in 1976.

There was another case of coronavirus infection in cats in 1966.
The virus caused inflammation of the abdomen (peritonitis) and was highly fatal.
The virus was identified in 1968, and was named as Feline infectious peritonitis virus by ICTV in 1991.
It was again renamed Feline coronavirus in 1999.
In 1974 there was an outbreak of viral infection among US military dogs.
The virus was identified as a coronavirus and the formal name Canine coronavirus was adopted by ICTV in 1991.
As the molecular and antigenic relationship of the three viruses were later established in the late 1980s, ICTV merged them into a single species Alphacoronavirus 1 in 2009.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is the virus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Also colloquially known simply as the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019
(HCoV-19 or hCoV-19).
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (and hence Baltimore class IV)
that is contagious in humans.

As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.

Taxonomically, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species
severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).

It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus.
Research is ongoing as to whether SARS‑CoV‑2 came directly from bats or indirectly through any intermediate hosts.

The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019.Epidemiological studies estimate that each infection results in an average of 2.39-3.44 new ones when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken.
The virus primarily spreads between people through close contact and via respiratory droplets produced from coughs or sneezes.
It mainly enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

==
Terminology ==
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, various names were used for the virus; some names used by different sources included the "coronavirus" or "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organisation recommended "2019 novel coronavirus" (2019-nCov) as the provisional name for the virus.
This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names.
On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS‑CoV‑2).
To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as "the COVID-19 virus" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles.
The general public often calls both the virus and the disease it causes, "the coronavirus".
U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the virus as the "Chinese virus" in tweets, interviews, and White House press briefings, which drew some criticism that he was stigmatizing the disease with racial or nationalistic overtones.

Virology ==


===
Infection and transmission ===

Human-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Transmission was initially assumed to occur primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.8 metres (6 ft).
Laser light scattering experiments suggest that speaking is an additional mode of transmission and a far-reaching and under-researched one, indoors, with little air flow.
Other studies have suggested that the virus may be airborne as well, with aerosols potentially being able to transmit the virus.
During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.
Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another possible cause of infection.
Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours; the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its lipid bilayer.
Viral RNA has also been found in stool samples and semen from infected individuals.
The degree to which the virus is infectious during the incubation period is uncertain, but research has indicated that the pharynx reaches peak viral load approximately four days after infection or the first week of symptoms, and declines after.
A study by a team of researchers from the University of North Carolina found that the nasal cavity is seemingly the dominant initial site for infection with subsequent aspiration-mediated virus seeding into the lungs in SARS‑CoV‑2 pathogenesis.
They found that there was an infection gradient from high in proximal towards low in distal pulmonary epithelial cultures, with a focal infection in ciliated cells and type 2 pneumocytes in the airway and alveolar regions respectively.
There is some evidence of human-to-animal transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2, including examples in felids.
Some institutions have advised those infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 to restrict contact with animals.

====
Asymptomatic transmission ====
On 1 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that "transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission".
One meta-analysis found that 17% of infections are asymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals were 42% less likely to transmit the virus.
However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the outbreak in China suggested that "pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections" and that subclinical infections may have been the source of a majority of infections.
That may explain how out of 217 onboard a cruise liner that docked at Montevideo, only 24 of 128 who tested positive for viral RNA showed symptoms.
Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the greatest amount of virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that "a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case".
====
Reinfection ====
There is uncertainty about reinfection and long-term immunity.
It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity.
The first reported case of reinfection was a 33-year-old man from Hong Kong who first tested positive on 26 March 2020, was discharged on 15 April 2020 after two negative tests, and tested positive again on 15 August 2020 (142 days later), which was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing showing that the viral genomes between the episodes belong to different clades.
The findings had the implications that herd immunity may not eliminate the virus if reinfection is not an uncommon occurrence and that vaccines may not be able to provide lifelong protection against the virus.
Another case study described a 25-year-old man from Nevada who tested positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 on 18 April 2020 and on 5 June 2020 (separated by two negative tests).
Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection.
The man's second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first infection, but the mechanisms that could account for this are not known.

===
Reservoir and zoonotic origin ===
The first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China.
The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.

Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market.

However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.

A March 2021 WHO report on a joint WHO-China study stated that human spillover via an intermediate animal host was the most likely explanation, with direct spillover from bats next most likely.
Introduction through the food supply chain and the Huanan Seafood Market was considered another possible, but less likely, explanation.
A phylogenetic network analysis of 160 early coronavirus genomes sampled from December 2019 to February 2020 showed that the virus type most closely related to the bat coronavirus was most abundant in Guangdong, China, and designated type "A".

The predominant type among samples from Wuhan, "B", is more distantly related to the bat coronavirus than the ancestral type "A".
Research into the natural reservoir of the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak has resulted in the discovery of many SARS-like bat coronaviruses,
most originating in the Rhinolophus genus of horseshoe bats.

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2.
Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2.
The RaTG13 virus sequence is the closest known sequence to SARS-CoV-2.

Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS‑CoV‑2, but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS‑CoV‑2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.
Although the role of pangolins as an intermediate host was initially posited (a study published in July 2020 suggested that pangolins are an intermediate host of SARS‑CoV‑2-like coronaviruses), subsequent studies have not substantiated their contribution to the spillover.
The possible intermediate host remains elusive.

Nearly half of the virus's genome has a phylogenetic lineage distinct from known relatives.
Isolates obtained from pangolins seized in Guangdong were only 92% identical in sequence to the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome, a number that is too low for the pangolin virus to be an intermediate host.
In addition, pangolins are unlikely to be reservoirs for SARS‑CoV‑2-like viruses because they get sick from the infection, unlike true reservoirs like bats.
The receptor-binding domain of the pangolin virus spike protein is highly similar to that of SARS‑CoV‑2, with the five critical amino acid residues in the receptor-binding motif being identical in both viruses.
However, the pangolin virus turns out to bind poorly to the human ACE2 receptor.
All available evidence suggests that SARS‑CoV‑2 has a natural animal origin and is not genetically engineered.

Nevertheless, early in the pandemic, conspiracy theories spread on social media claiming that the virus was bio-engineered by China at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
While some scientists, including former CDC director Robert R. Redfield, believe it is likely that the virus may have been studied by and escaped from the Institute, the March 2021 WHO report on the joint WHO-China study stated that such an explanation is "extremely unlikely".
===
Phylogenetics and taxonomy ===
SARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses.
It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment.
Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%).
It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS
-CoV.Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B).
Coronaviruses also undergo frequent recombination.
Its RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length, relatively long for a coronavirus.
SARS‑CoV‑2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses.
With a sufficient number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses.
By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.
A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were "highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.
As of 7 May 2020, 4,690 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.
On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species.
Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus.
In July 2020, scientists reported that a more infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 variant with spike protein variant G614 has replaced D614 as the dominant form in the pandemic.

In October 2020 scientists reported in a preprint that a variant,  20A.EU1, was first observed in Spain in early summer and has become the most frequent variant in multiple European countries.
They also illustrate the emergence and spread of other frequent clusters of sequences using Nextstrain.
In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome.
It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response.
ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins.

====
Variants ====
There are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades.
Several different clade nomenclatures have been proposed.
Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven
(L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2020.

Lineage B.1.1.7 (formerly known as Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC 202012/01)) is believed to have emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020.
Epidemiological markers suggest that the variant is more transmissible and lethal.
Among the variant's several mutations is one in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein that changes the asparagine at position 501 to tyrosine (N501Y).
This mutation may cause the virus to bind more tightly to the ACE2 receptor.
It is currently spread globally.

The 501.V2 variant, which has the same N501Y mutation, arose independently in South Africa.
It was detected in patient specimens collected at the beginning of October 2020 and currently spread globally.

The B.1.207 variant appeared in Nigeria.
It has a mutation in the spike protein (P681H) that is also found in the VOC 202012/01 variant.
P681H is located near the S1/S2 furin cleavage site.
There is no evidence that the mutations increase transmissibility of the variant.

The Lineage B.1.525 first cases were detected in December 2020 in the United Kingdom and Nigeria.
It is currently spread globally.

The Cluster 5 variant emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.
It has a set of mutations that have not been observed in other variants, including four amino acid changes in the spike protein.
The variant moderately resists neutralizing antibodies.
After strict quarantines, a ban on mink farming, and a mink euthanasia campaign, it is believed to have been eradicated.

Lineage P.1 first detected in Manaus, Brazil and already spread globally, the preprint works showed the variant to be more transmissible and have higher rate of deaths than B.1.1.28 and B.1.195 lineages.

===
Structural biology ===
Each SARS-CoV-2 virion is 50–200 nanometres in diameter.
Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope.
The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy, is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion.

Protein modeling experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS‑CoV‑2 has sufficient affinity to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells to use them as a mechanism of cell entry.
By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS‑CoV‑2.
Studies have shown that SARS‑CoV‑2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus.
SARS‑CoV‑2 may also use basigin to assist in cell entry.
Initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2
(TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS‑CoV‑2.
The host protein neuropilin 1 (NRP1) may aid the virus in host cell entry using ACE2.
After a SARS‑CoV‑2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's protease TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a fusion peptide in the S2 subunit, and the host receptor ACE2.
After fusion, an endosome forms around the virion, separating it from the rest of the host cell.
The virion escapes when the pH of the endosome drops or when cathepsin, a host cysteine protease, cleaves it.
The virion then releases RNA into the cell and forces the cell to produce and disseminate copies of the virus, which infect more cells.
SARS‑CoV‑2 produces at least three virulence factors that promote shedding of new virions from host cells and inhibit immune response.
Whether they include downregulation of ACE2, as seen in similar coronaviruses, remains under investigation (as of May 2020).

==
Epidemiology ==
Based on the low variability exhibited among known SARS‑CoV‑2 genomic sequences, health authorities likely detected the virus within weeks of its emergence among the human population in late 2019.
The earliest case of infection currently known is dated to 1 December 2019, although an earlier case could have occurred on 17 November 2019.
The virus subsequently spread to all provinces of China and to more than 150 other countries across the world.

Human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed in all these regions.

On 30 January 2020, SARS‑CoV‑2 was designated a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO, and on 11 March 2020
the WHO declared it a pandemic.
Retrospective tests collected within the Chinese surveillance system revealed no clear indication of substantial unrecognized circulation of SARS‑CoV‑2 in Wuhan during the latter part of 2019.The basic reproduction number (
R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  ) of the virus has been estimated to be around 5.7.

This means each infection from the virus is expected to result in 5.7 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken.

The reproduction number may be higher in densely populated conditions such as those found on cruise ships.

Many forms of preventive efforts may be employed in specific circumstances to reduce the propagation of the virus.
There have been about 96,000 confirmed cases of infection in mainland China.

While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear, one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015.

Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.

As of 29 April 2021, the percentage had decreased to 0.10%.As of 29 April 2021, there have been 149,744,454 total confirmed cases of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection in the ongoing pandemic.
The total number of deaths attributed to the virus is 3,153,526.
Many recoveries from both confirmed and untested infections go unreported, since some countries do not collect this data, but at least 86,977,813 people have recovered from confirmed infections.

The history of coronaviruses is a reflection of the discovery of the diseases caused by coronaviruses and identification of the viruses.
It starts with the first report of a new type of upper-respiratory tract disease among chickens in North Dakota, US, in 1931.
The causative agent was identified as a virus in 1933.
By 1936, the disease and the virus were recognised as unique from other viral disease.
The became known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), but later officially renamed as Avian coronavirus.

A new brain disease of mice (murine encephalomyelitis) was discovered in 1947 at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
The virus causing the disease was called JHM (after Harvard pathologist John Howard Mueller).
Three years later a new mouse hepatitis was reported from the National Institute for Medical Research in London.
The causative virus was identified as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).In 1961, a virus was obtained from a school boy in Epsom, England, who was suffering from common cold.
The sample designated B814 was confirmed as novel virus in 1965.
New common cold viruses (assigned 229E) collected from medical students at the University of Chicago were also reported in 1966.
Structural analyses of IBV, MHV, B18 and 229E using transmission electron microscopy revealed that they all belong to the same group of viruses.
Making a crucial comparison in 1967, June Almeida and David Tyrrell invented the collective name coronavirus, as all those viruses were characterised by solar corona-like projections (called spikes) on their surfaces.
Other coronaviruses have been discovered from pigs, dogs, cats, rodents, cows, horses, camels, Beluga whales, birds and bats.
As of 2020, 39 species are described.
Bats are found to be the richest source of different species of coronaviruses.
All coronaviruses originated from a common ancestor about 293 million years ago.
Zoonotic species such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the aetiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic.
==
Discovery of chicken coronavirus ==
Arthur Frederick Schalk and Merle C. Fawn at the North Dakota Agricultural College were the first to report what was later identified as coronavirus disease in chickens.
Their publication in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in 1931 indicates that there was a new respiratory disease that mostly affected 2-day-old to 3-week-old chickens.
They referred to the disease as "an apparently new respiratory disease of baby chicks."
The symptoms included severe shortness of breath and physical weakness.

The infection was contagious and virulent.
It was easily transmitted through direct contact between chickens or experimental transfer of the bronchial exudates from infected to healthy chickens.
Maximum mortality recorded was 90%.The causative pathogen was not known.
Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station in New Brunswick, New Jersey, put forth a hypothesis in 1932 that virus could be the cause and introduced the name as "virus of the infectious bronchitis.
"
But this was a misattribution because at the time another related disease, known as infectious laryngotracheitis, was reported that exhibited almost similar symptoms but mostly affected adult chickens.
As Beaudette later recalled in 1937, the disease he described was infectious layngotracheitis, saying: "Infectious laryngotracheitis is said to be the correct name for this disease rather than infectious bronchitis…
Moreover, the gasping symptom ordinarily accepted as typical of the disease is also a prominent symptom in infectious bronchitis (gasping disease, chick bronchitis).
"
The names infectious bronchitis and infectious laryngotracheitis were till then used synonymously and interchangeably.

Unaware of the developments, Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly at the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station studied a similar case which they called "gasping disease" due to the apparent symptom.
They had known the disease since 1928.
Their report in 1933 titled "Laryngotracheitis in chicks" published in the Poultry Science indicated a clear distinction of infectious bronchitis from infectious laryngotracheitis as the main organ affected was the bronchi.
The bronchi infection resulted in severe gasping and swift death due to inability to eat food.
It was also found that the pathogens could not be bacteria or protozoans as they passed through membranes (Berkefield filter) that would block those pathogens.
The isolation and identification of the pathogen as a virus was reported as:

In several experiments we have reproduced the disease in chicks by the intratracheal, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection of Berkefeld filtered material.
The chicks developed typical gasping symptoms after various periods of incubation, different groups of chicks first showing symptoms in six, seventeen, nineteen, etc.,
days after receiving the filtrate...
The disease may also be transferred by means of filtrates of spleen, liver, and kidney tissues and by the transfer of bacteriologically sterile blood.

This was the discovery of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).
But Bushnell and Brandy made an erroneous remark by saying, "The symptoms and lesions in the chicks [caused by IBV] are similar to those seen in so-called laryngotracheitis of adult birds and are probably due to the same agent.
"In 1936
, Jerry Raymond Beach and Oscar William Schalm at the University of California, Berkeley, reexamined Bushnell and Brady's experiment with a conclusion that infectious laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis with their causative viruses were different.
(
Beach had discovered infectious laryngotracheitis virus in 1931.)
They concluded that:

It was found that chickens that recovered from an infection with one of the two strains of virus were refractory to further infection with either strain.
It was also found that the sera from chickens that have recovered from an infection with one strain of the virus would neutralize virus of either strain.
These results show the identity of the two strains of virus.

Chickens refractory to infection with this virus were shown to be susceptible to the virus of laryngotracheitis.
Likewise, chickens refractory to the latter virus were susceptible to the former.
These results demonstrate that the two viruses are distinct from one another.
Hudson and Beaudette later in 1937 were able to culture IBV for the first time using chicken embryos.
This specimen, known as the Beaudette strain, became the first coronavirus to have its genome completely sequenced in 1987.

==
Discovery of mouse coronaviruses ==
Francis Sargent Cheevers, Joan B. Daniels, Alwin M. Pappenheimer and Orville T. Bailey investigated the case of brain disease (murine encephalitis) at the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology of Harvard Medical School in Boston in 1949.
Two laboratory mice (Schwenktker strains) of 17 and 18 days old had flaccid paralysis and died.
By then it was known that murine encephalitis was caused by a picornavirus, called Theiler's virus, which was discovered by Max Theiler at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York in 1937.
But the Harvard scientists found that the two mice had unusual symptoms other than brain damage (demyelination).
The mice had no visible illness or diarrhoea, which usually are associated with murine encephalitis.
In addition, the causative virus was isolated from different organs including liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.
This indicated that brain was not the primary target organ.
Liver was particularly affected with severe necrosis, indicating hepatitis.
The new virus was named JHM, after the initials of John Howard Mueller.
In the autumn of 1950 there was a sudden outbreak of fatal hepatitis among laboratory mice (Parkes or P strains) at the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London.
Alan Watson Gledhill and Christopher Howard Andrewes isolated the causative virus, which experimentally was highly infectious to healthy mice.
They named the virus as "mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).
"
Gledhill called the experiments on the highly infectious nature of the virus as a "bizarre discovery".
John A. Morris at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, discovered a new mouse virus, named H747, in 1959 from samples in Japan.
When he compared the virus with JHM and MHV using serological tests he found that they were both antigenically related, upon which he created a common name as "hepatoencephalitis group of murine viruses."
==
Discovery of human coronaviruses ==
Human coronaviruses were discovered as one of the many causative viruses of common cold.
Research on the study of common cold originated when the British Medical Research Council and the Ministry of Health established the Common Cold Research Unit (CCRU) at Salisbury in 1946.
Directed by Andrewes, the research laboratory discovered several viruses such as influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses and rhinoviruses that cause common cold.
David Arthur John Tyrrell joined CCRU in 1957 and succeeded Andrewes in 1962.
He developed a technique for growing rhinoviruses using nasal epithelial cells for the first time in 1960.
His team soon after developed a concept of broad categorisation of common cold viruses into two groups: one group, called H strain, could be maintained only in human-embryo-kidney cell culture, and another group,  designated M strain, could be maintained both in human-embryo-kidney cell culture and monkey-embryo-kidney cell culture.
By then many common cold viruses could be grown in either of these cell cultures and were accordingly classified as M or H strain.

During 1960-1961, Tyrrell's team collected throat swabs from 170 school boys having common cold at a boarding school in Epsom, Surrey.
England.
Among few samples that could not be cultured in any of the culture media, a specimen designated B814, collected on 17 February 1961, was particularly infectious among healthy volunteers.
There was no evidence whether the pathogen in B814 was a bacterium or a virus as all bacterial and viral culture methods available showed negative results.
It could only be maintained in human tracheal culture and experimentally passed on to healthy volunteers by nasal inoculation.
In 1965, they were able to confirm that the pathogen was a filter-passing virus, susceptible to ether treatment (indicating a lipid envelope of the virus), able to induce cold in antibiotic-treated volunteers (indicating it was not a bacterium), and cultured in human-embryo-trachea epithelial cell culture.
Serological tests (antigen-antibody reactions) further indicated that the virus was not related (not reactive) to antibodies (serotypes) of any known viruses at the time.
Reporting in the British Medical Journal, Tyrrell and Malcolm L. Bynoe wrote their conclusion as:After considerable initial doubts we now believe that the B814 strain is a virus virtually unrelated to any other known virus of the human respiratory tract, although, since it is ether-labile, it may be a myxovirus.
But they contradicted themselves regarding the identity of the virus as they mentioned in the experimental results, saying:It was concluded that B814 did not belong to any of the serotypes of myxovirus used, but might be distantly related to influenza C or Sendai viruses.
In an independent research in US, Dorothy Hamre and John J. Procknow studied respiratory tract infection among medical students at the University of Chicago.
In 1962, they obtained five samples that were associated with very different symptoms, causing mild cold only, and could be cultured only in secondary human kidney tissue in contrast to other cold viruses which could be maintained in monkey-embryo-kidney cell culture.
Serological test indicated they were not myxoviruses (Orthomyxoviridae).
They presented their discovery as "A new virus isolated from the human respiratory tract" in the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine in 1966.
They further studied one sample, designated 229E, grown in human diploid cell culture (Wi-38) and described its developmental stages using transmission electron microscopy to show that it was new type of virus.

==
Discovery of the structure ==
Viruses cannot be seen normally with light microscopes.
It was only with the development of electron microscopy that viruses could be visualised and structurally elucidated.
Reginald L. Reagan, Jean E. Hauser, Mary G. Lillie, and Arthur H. Craige Jr. of the University of Maryland were the first to describe the structure of coronavirus using the transmission electron microscopy.
In 1948, they reported in The Cornell Veterinarian that IBV was spherical in shape and some of them had filamentous projections.
But the images were difficult to interpret due to poor resolution and low magnification (at × 28,000).
Their subsequent studies did not show any striking properties from other viruses.
An important advancement was made by Charles Henry Domermuth and O.F. Edwards at the University of Kentucky in 1957 when they observed IBVs as "ring or doughnut-shaped structures."

D.M. Berry at the Glaxo Laboratories, Middlesex, UK, with J.G. Cruickshank, H.P. Chu and R.J.H. Wells at the University of Cambridge published a more comprehensive and better electron microscopic images in 1964.
Four strains of IBV, including Beaudette strain, were compared with influenza virus, with which they share most resemblance.
In contrast to influenza virus in which the projections were small and straight, all IBV strains had "pear-shaped projections", which were names the "spikes" and described as:These “spikes” were often seen over part of the surface only and were less densely packed than those seen in influenza viruses.
They varied considerably in shape.
Commonly they appeared to be attached to the virus by a very narrow neck and to thicken towards their distal ends, sometimes forming a bulbous mass 90-110 Å in diameter.
J. F. David-Ferreira and R. A. Manaker from the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, were the first to study the structure of MHV in 1965.
They also observed the surface projections as on IBV, stating, "The outer surface of the particle is covered by 'spicules'."

In 1966, Tyrrell sought the help of Anthony Peter Waterson at the St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London who had recruited June Dalziel Almeida as an electron microscopist.
Almeida had studied IBV and MHV finding them as structurally distinct viruses, but her manuscript was rejected upon a referee's decision that the microscopic images were of influenza virus and lacked novelty.
Tyrrell supplied the human virus samples from which it was possible to ascertain the viral structure.
Almeida and Tyrrell published their findings in the April 1967 issue of the Journal of General Virology, in which they concluded:Probably the most interesting finding from these experiments was that two human respiratory viruses, 229 E and B814 are morphologically identical with avian infectious bronchitis.
Their biological properties, as far as they are known, are consistent with this.
Both the human viruses are ether sensitive as is avian infectious bronchitis
229 E, have a similar size by filtration and multiply in the presence of an inhibitor of DNA synthesis.

In 1967, Kenneth McIntosh and co-workers at the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, reported the structure of common cold viruses they collected from fellow workers during 1965-1966.
They found six of their samples had common characters with B814.
Two samples (designated OC38 and OC43, as the number of specimen in organ culture) were particularly virulent and caused encephalitis in experimental mice.
They compared the structure of one of their samples numbered 501 (OC43 ) with those of 229E, IBV and influenza virus.
It was so identical to IBV that they called the human viruses as "IBV-like viruses".
They made a definitive description as:All "IBV-like" viruses, 229E, and IBV itself show the following characteristics: (1) an over-all diameter of 160 mμ with a variation of ± 440 mμ; (2) a moderate pleomorphism with resultant elliptical, round, or tear-drop shapes but no filamentous or "tailed" forms;
(3) characteristic spikes
20 mμ long, usually club- or pear-shaped narrow at the base and 10 mμ wide at the outer edge, spaced widely apart and distributed fairly uniformly about the circumference of the particle.

== Invention of the name and history of the taxonomy ==
By mid-1967 it was recognised that IBV, MHV, B814 and 229E were structurally and biologically similar so that they form a distinct group.
Tyrrell met Waterson and Almeida in London to decide on the name of the viruses.
Almeida had earlier suggested the term "influenza-like" because of their resemblance, but Tyrrell thought it inappropriate.
Almeida came up with a novel name "coronavirus".
Tyrrell wrote of his recollection in Cold Wars:
The Fight Against the Common Cold in 2002:
Even though we could only base our judgement on the electron microscope images we were quite certain that we had identified a previously unrecognised group of viruses.
So what should we call them? '
Influenza-like' seem a bit feeble, somewhat vague, and probably misleading.
We looked more closely at the appearance of the new viruses and noticed that they had a kind of halo surrounding them.
Recourse to a dictionary produced the Latin equivalent, corona, and
so the name coronavirus was born.
Proposal of the new name was submitted to and accepted by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (ICNV, established in 1966).
16 November 1968 issue of Nature reported the justification by Almeida, Berry, C.H. Cunningham, Hamre, M.S. Hofstad, L. Mallucci, McIntosh and Tyrrell as:Particles [of IBV] are more or less rounded in profile; although there is a certain amount of polymorphism, there is also a characteristic "fringe" of projections 200 Å long, which are rounded or petal shaped, rather than sharp or pointed, as in the myxoviruses.
This appearance, recalling the solar corona, is shared by mouse hepatitis virus and several viruses recently recovered from man, namely strain B814, 229E and several others...
In the opinion of the eight virologists these viruses are members of a previously unrecognized group which they suggest should be called the coronaviruses, to recall the characteristic appearance by which these viruses are identified in the electron microscope.
Coronavirus was accepted as a genus name by ICNV in its first report in 1971.
IBV was then officially designated the type species as Avian infectious bronchitis virus (but renamed to Avian coronavirus in 2009).
Mouse hepatitis virus approved in 1971 was merged with Rat coronavirus (discovered in 1970) as Murine coronavirus in 2009.
229E and OC43 were collectively named Human respiratory virus but merged as Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) in 2009.
The first discovered human coronavirus B814 was antigenically different from 229E and OC43, but it could not be propagated in culture and was exhausted during experiments in 1968, thus, was excluded in taxonomy.
Coroniviridae was adopted as the family name in the ICNV (soon after renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV)
second report in 1975.229E and OC43 were together named Human respiratory virus in the ICNV first report.
The species was split into Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-OC229E) and Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) in 1995.
While HCoV-OC229E is retained as a valid species, HCoV-OC43 was merged with Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (discovered in 1962), Bovine coronavirus  (discovered in 1973), Human enteric coronavirus (discovered in 1975), Equine coronavirus (discovered in 2000) and Canine respiratory coronavirus (discovered in 2003) into a single species Betacoronavirus 1 in 2009.Owing to increasing number and diversity of new species discovered, CTV split the genus Coronavirus in 2009 into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus.
As of 2020, there are 39 species of coronaviruses under the family Coronaviridae.
There are 7 human coronaviruses while 32 species are those of pigs, dogs, cats, rodents, cows, horses, camels, Beluga whales, birds and bats.

Other human coronaviruses ==


===
Human coronavirus
NL63 (
HCoV-NL63)
===
HCoV-NL63 was discovered in January 2003 from a seven-month-old baby in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
The baby was suffering from bronchiolitis, coryza, conjunctivitis and fever.
A year later, a comprehensive analysis of nasal swab samples was done from where it was found that a sample from an eight-month-old boy diagnosed in 1988 with pneumonia had a similar virus (HCoV-NL).
The virus was independently described in 2005 as HCoV-NH following a discovery among a group of children having respiratory infection in New Haven, Connecticut, US.
The origin of the virus remains a mystery, but it is closely related to tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) coronavirus and can survive in bat cell lines, suggesting that it is derived from animals (zoonotic).
===
Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) ===
HCoV-HKU1 was discovered from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong, China, who was suffering from pneumonia in January 2004.
When samples (nasopharyngeal aspirates from pneumonia patients) collected between April 2004 to March 2005 were analysed in 2006, it was found that 13 individuals had HCoV-HKU1.
The same year, the virus was subsequently reported from Australia, Europe, and US.
===
Zoonotic coronaviruses ===
Coronaviruses that are transmitted from animals (zoonoses) are clinically the most important human coronaviruses as they are responsible for a series of global epidemics.
There are two species of such coronaviruses:


==== 1.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ====
Two distinct viruses are known under this species, namely SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV emerged as an acute respiratory syndrome in Guangdong Province, southern China, during 16 November 2002 to 28 February 2003.
The syndrome was accompanied by pneumonia that was fatal in many cases.
The infection was believed to have been contained in China, but an infected individual carried it to Hong Kong on 21 February and spread it in the hospital.
The first clinical case outside China was reported on 26 February 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam.
It rapidly spread to Southeast Asia, North America and Europe.
The World Health Organization (WHO) notified an epidemic alert on 6 March 2003, referring to the disease as severe acute respiratory syndrome.
The virus was identified as a novel coronavirus from Hong Kong in April, from Toronto in May, and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in US in May.
In October, the samples from Guangdong were established as the prototype specimens, and the name SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) was introduced.
ICTV approved it as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2004, and renamed it Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in 2009.
By mid-July 2003, the infection subsided, and by then it had spread to 28 countries infecting 8096 people and causing 774 deaths.
In October, it was found that the infection was acquired from the masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) from a live-animal market in Guangdong.
Further studies in 2005 showed that civets were the intermediate reservoirs of the virus, and horseshoe bats (Rhinilophus species) were the natural hosts.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was known from cases of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 individuals having "viral pneumonia" on 31 December 2019.
The first known case was recorded on 12 December.
The first case outside China was in Thailand on 13 January.
WHO adopted the name of the disease as "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020, and used "2019 novel coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV" for the virus.
On 2 March 2020, ICTV published the formal description and gave the official name as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO declared the infection as pandemic on 11 March, and since then has spread to more than 192 countries and territories, affecting over 149 million people and resulting resulting in more than 3.15 million deaths.
The origin of the virus is not known.
Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) which are available in the live-animal market in Wuhan city has been studied as a probable source as the virus is closely related to the pangolin coronavirus.
Genetic evidence that it bears 93% nucleotide similarity with a novel coronavirus of Malayan horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus malayanus), and 96% identity with Bat SARS-like coronavirus RaTG13 of intermediate horseshoe bat (R. affinis) indicates that it probably originated in bats.

==== 2.
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ====
In April 2012, the Ministry of Health, Jordan, reported an outbreak of acute respiratory illness affecting 11 people at a hospital in Zarqa.
On 13 June 2012, a 60-year-old man having the symptoms was admitted to Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
He was diagnosed with acute pneumonia and died on 24 June due to progressive respiratory and renal failure.
His sputum sample showed the presence of coronavirus very similar to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5.
The virus was named HCoV-EMC (after Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where it was identified).
Retrospective study of samples from the Jordan hospital revealed that the diseases and the virus were similar.
WHO referred to the virus as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on 23 May 2013.
ICTV announced the name as Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus on 15 May 2013.
In 2013, a study revealed that the virus was 100% genetically identical to the coronavirus of the Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus coronavirus HKU4) from Bisha, Saudi Arabia, indicating its origin.
In 2014, it was established that the virus was transmitted to humans by dromedary camels, which act as the intermediate hosts.
By December 2019, the infection was confirmed in 2,499 individuals with 858 deaths (34·3% mortality) from 27 countries covering all continents.

Other animal coronaviruses ==


===
Feline infectious peritonitis virus ===
A viral infection in pigs, called transmissible gastroenteritis, which was characterised mainly by diarrhoea and vomiting, and associated with high mortality was first recognised by Leo P. Doyle and L. M. Hutchings in 1946.
A. W. McClurkin isolated and identified the virus in 1965.
The virus was named Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine in the ICNV first report, and changed to Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (PTGV) in the second report in 1976.
A new disease that caused inflammation of the abdomen (peritonitis) in cats was reported in 1966, the virus was identified in 1968, and was named by ICTV in 1991 as Feline infectious peritonitis virus.
In 1974 a new coronavirus was discovered from US military dogs, and was named by ICTV in 1991 as Canine coronavirus.

As the molecular and antigenic relationship of the three viruses were later established, ICTV merged the three viruses into Alphacoronavirus 1 in 2009.

===
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ===
An acute infectious diarrhoea was first known in England in 1971.
The infection was specifically among fattening pigs and sows.
It was referred to as TOO (for "the other one") or TGE2 (for "transmissible gastroenteritis type 2") as the symptoms were similar to transmissible gastroenteritis.
Other than causing rapid and acute diarrhoea, it was not a fatal disease.
The case was first reported by J. Oldham in Pig Farming in 1972 using the term "epidemic diarrhea".
A second outbreak occurred in 1976, and was called "porcine epidemic diarrhoea.
"
It eventually spread throughout Europe.
M. B. Pensaert and P. de Bouck at the University of Gent, Begium isolated and identified the new coronavirus in 1978, and designated it CV777.
It eventually spread throughout Europe.
ICTV named the virus Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in 1995.
An epidemic broke out from China in 2010 that spread throughout the world.
A virulent strain emerged in US between 2013 and 2015.
It affected pigs of all ages, and mortality was as high as 95% among the suckling piglets.
Another severe outbreak occurred in Germany in 2014 that spread to other European countries.

===
Bat coronaviruses ===
Reagan and his colleagues at the University of Maryland were the first to investigate bats as a potential sources of coronavirus in 1956.
They experimentally inoculated 44 cave bats or little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with IBV and found that all of them developed the symptoms of infectious bronchitis.
Their report reads:50 percent of the bats exposed to the infectious bronchitis virus showed symptoms or death in the intracerebral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, intracardiac and intraocular groups; 75 percent in the intranasal and intrarectal groups; 100 percent in the intraoral group; and 25 percent intralingual and intramuscular group, whereas the controls appeared normal.
But nothing was known of the real nature of bats as reservoirs of coronaviruses until the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome of humans in 2002/2003.
Since the identification of SARS-CoV was identified in the early 2003, and horseshoe bats as their natural hosts in 2005, bats have been extensively studied.
Among all coronavirus hosts, bats are known to harbour the most variety, with more than 30 species identified.
According to diversity estimate, there may be 3,200 species of coronaviruses in bats.

==
Evolutionary history ==
According to phylogenetic estimate all coronaviruses evolved from the most recent common ancestor that lived around 190 to 489 (with a mean of 293) million years ago.
The four genera split up around 2,400 to 3,300 years ago into bat and avian coronavirus ancestors.
Bat coronavirus gave rise to species of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus that infect mammals, while avian coronavirus produced those of Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus that infect birds.
Zoonotic coronaviruses emerged recently.
For instance, SARS-CoV was transmitted from bats in 1998 (4.08 years prior to the outbreak), and diverged from bat coronavirus in around 1962.
SARS-CoV-2 evolved from bat coronavirus in around 1948.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Canada was announced on January 25, 2020, involving a traveller who had recently returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan.

Ontario has had the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among Canada's provinces and territories, but due to having the largest population, only ranks fourth adjusted per capita.

==
Timeline ==
A state of emergency was declared by Premier Doug Ford on March 17, 2020 as a result of increasing transmission province-wide.
This included the gradual implementation of restrictions on gatherings and commerce.
On April 3, 2020, the province released modelling projecting that over the full course of the pandemic, 100,000 deaths would occur in Ontario with no public health measures and 3,000–15,000 deaths would likely occur with public health measures.
From late spring to early summer, the majority of the deaths were residents of long-term care homes.
In late April 2020, one out of five of all long-term care homes in Ontario had an outbreak and 70% to 80% of all COVID-19 deaths had been in retirement and long-term care homes.
Following medical assistance and observation by the Canadian Armed Forces, the military released a report detailing "a number of medical, professional and technical issues" amongst 'for-profit' long-term-care homes including neglect, lack of equipment and allegations of elder abuse.
From May through August 2020, the province instituted a three-stage plan to lift economic restrictions, subject to the employment of social distancing and other guidelines, and continued restrictions on the sizes of gatherings.
The state of emergency was lifted on July 24, 2020.
A plan was implemented for the return-to-class of public schools, involving more than 2 million children.
In early September 2020, the province showed a significant increase in new cases, along with similar spikes in provinces across the country.
Ontario began to reintroduce some restrictions, initially and particularly in the hotspots of Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and Ottawa.
In early November, the province unveiled a new five-tiered colour-coded "response framework".
The framework was created initially in contradiction to the metrics suggested to political officials by Public Health Ontario and later amended by the province to lower thresholds in each category.
From late November to mid-December 2020, the province began placing regions in rolling lockdowns, culminating in a province-wide shutdown beginning Boxing Day.
Due to the post-winter holiday surge of new infections, Premier Ford declared Ontario's second state of emergency on January 12, 2021, which was lifted February 10, and a stay-at-home order effective January 14, which was phased out regionally between February 10 and March 8.
Regions then returned to individual categories in the response framework.

Following Health Canada's approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna, widespread plans for vaccinations began during the week of December 14, 2020.
Early vaccination efforts were highly criticized.
However, the province now leads the nation in doses administered.
Due to a shortage of both approved vaccines in late January and early February, vaccinations slowed significantly for a number of weeks.
In late February 2021, shipments of the two approved vaccines at the time increased significantly, and on February 26, 2021, Health Canada approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine for use and on March 5, 2021 approved the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for a total of four approved vaccines.
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines began to be administered in pharmacies and family health practices March 10, 2021.In mid-March 2021, the Ontario Hospital Association, Ontario's COVID-19 scientific advisory table and Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health declared the province was experiencing a third wave of the virus.
Following the third wave surge, ICU numbers in late March climbed to their highest numbers since the beginning of the pandemic.
On April 1, 2021 the government announced a second province wide shutdown beginning April 3.
Ford later issued a third state of emergency and stay-at-home order for the province beginning April 8, 2021, and ordered all schools to close on April 12 (public schools were in the middle of spring break, delayed from March to April).
On April 15, Ontario reported its largest single-day increase in cases to date, at 4,736.

This was surpassed the next day by 4,816 cases; Premier Ford announced that the stay-at-home order would be extended through May 20, and announced restrictions on outdoor recreation and interprovincial land travel into the province.

==
Provincial government response ==
On March 15, 2020, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) ordered the closure of all provincial casinos.
On March 17, Premier Ford declared a provincial state of emergency, prohibiting public gatherings larger than 50 people, and ordering the closure of all schools, child care services, libraries, indoor recreation facilities, dine-in bars and restaurants, and all cinemas, theatres, and concert venues.
Ford stated the "vast majority" of businesses were not affected by the order,  promising that "essential services and essential needs will be available to every individual and families.
On March 20 further measures were announced, including waiving the three-month waiting period for Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage, the launch of an e-learning portal, and extended privileges for hospitals to re-deploy staff.
On March 23, Ford ordered all "non-essential" businesses closed by 11:59 p.m.
A list of 74 "essential" businesses was published later in the day.

On March 27 at 2:00 p.m. ET, Alert Ready was activated on all radio stations, television broadcasters and LTE wireless networks in Ontario, broadcasting an emergency alert warning those returning from international travel of their obligation to self-isolate for 14 days under the Quarantine Act.
On March 30, the Ontario government extended the state of emergency through April 13, and also ordered the province-wide closure of all outdoor recreational amenities, including beaches, playgrounds and sports facilities (several Ontario municipalities including Toronto, had already ordered similar closures of their recreational amenities several days prior to the province-wide order).On April 3, it was announced the number of "essential" businesses would be reduced to 44 beginning 11:59 p.m. on April 4; this included Ontario Cannabis Store and the halting of most non-essential construction, including industrial construction, and residential construction that did not begin before April 4, but excluding "critical" infrastructure projects.
On May 27, all existing public health orders were extended through June 9, 2020.On April 27, Premier Ford released "A Framework for Reopening our Province", a roadmap detailing a "gradual" lifting of economic restrictions.
The process was divided into three stages, with the first intending to allow reopening outdoor spaces, businesses that can "immediately meet or modify operations" to allow a larger number of participants in certain types of gatherings and allow the resumption of some non-elective medical procedures.
Stage 2 would allow additional businesses and outdoor spaces to reopen, and increase the limit on participants in gatherings.
Stage 3 would contain further relaxation of prior restrictions, although restrictions on large public gatherings will remain in place indefinitely.
After the process began in mid-May, the entirety of the province reached Stage 3 in mid-August.
On June 12, Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams issued guidelines for "social circles" — allowance for families to expand their interactions with up to 10 people (including themselves) from outside of their immediate household.
On September 17, in response to a surge in new cases in parts of the province, it was announced that the maximum size of "unmonitored social gatherings and organized public events" in the Ottawa, Peel, and Toronto regions would be reduced from 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors, to 10 indoors and 25 outdoors.
Organizers of events that violate this restriction can be fined a minimum of $10,000, on top of the existing $750 fine for violating Ontario public health orders.
Ford stated that the rule was primarily intended to target events occurring in parks and private locations, and that staffed facilities not targeted under the rule (such as banquet halls, cinemas, convention centres, and restaurants) have employed safety protocols compliant with the province's health guidance.
On September 19, the aforementioned restrictions on private gatherings were extended province-wide.
On September 25, it was announced that effective September 26 province-wide, strip clubs would be ordered closed, and that all bars, restaurants and nightclubs would be required to end the sale of alcoholic beverages at 11:00 p.m. and close their dining rooms between midnight and 5:00 a.m. nightly.
On October 2, Premier Ford announced that the wearing of face masks would become mandatory province-wide in all public spaces and workplaces when social distancing is not possible, effective October 3.
A number of health regions had already implemented similar mandates at the regional level.
In addition, new restrictions were introduced in the Ottawa, Peel, and Toronto regions; bars and restaurants must collect contact information from all patrons for contact tracing purposes, and are capped at a capacity of 100 people and six patrons per table.
Event facilities were capped at a capacity of 50 people total (rather than 50 per room) and also subject to the six-person cap.
Gyms are also capped at 50 patrons, and exercise classes were capped at 10.Due to heightened cases in the regions, Peel, Ottawa, and Toronto were rolled back to Modified Stage 2 from October 10 to November 7, reinstating closures of indoor dining areas, casinos, cinemas and theatres, gyms, and personal care services that require the removal of face masks.
All gatherings are capped at 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors, and team sports are restricted to practices only, with scrimmages and games prohibited.
Wedding receptions were also prohibited following the Thanksgiving long weekend.
Schools and places of worship will continue operations.
On October 16, it was announced that York Region would also be placed under Modified Stage 2 beginning October 19.On November 25, a report was released by Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk which found that Ontario's initial response to COVID-19 was "slower and more reactive relative to most other provinces and many other international jurisdictions" (in contrast to its response to the SARS outbreak).
The report found that Public Health Ontario had a "diminished role" in the response, including the province's Central Co-ordination Table for COVID-19 consisting largely of deputy ministers rather than public health officials such as Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams (who acted primarily on the advice of Ontario's Health Command Table), and ignoring recommendations made by public health officials.

===
Schools and daycares ===
On March 12, 2020, the provincial government announced that publicly funded schools would be closed for an additional two weeks after March Break until April 5.
On March 24.
Premier Ford announced that the reopening of schools would be delayed indefinitely past the original April 6 target.
On March 31, Premier Ford announced that in-person classes would remain suspended through at least May 4; in tandem, Minister of Education Stephen Lecce announced the second phase of its "Learn from Home" program, which would involve "teacher-led" instruction delivered via distance education.
On April 14, Premier Ford delayed the reopening of public schools once again, on April 26 it was announced that there were plans to resume in-person classes on May 31.
On May 19, Premier Ford announced that all public schools would remain closed through the end of the semester, with plans to pursue in-person classes when the next school year begins in September.

====
Fall Semester 2020 ====
For the next school year, Lecce presented three scenarios: full online learning, a hybrid of online and in-class learning, and a return to full-time in-class learning.
On July 30, it was announced that elementary schools would return to class full-time, while high schools in 24 districts with higher enrollment would use a hybrid model, alternating daily between in-person and online instruction to reduce class sizes, with physical classes conducted in cohorts of 15 students each.
Students in grade 4 and higher would be required to wear a face mask, parents would have the option to opt out of in-person classes in favour of online classes, and high school students with special needs would be able to attend in-person daily if they are not capable of using remote learning.
The province allocated $309 million in funding to cover the costs of additional cleaning supplies, protective equipment, and staffing.
The plan faced criticism from parents, educators, and health care professionals, noting that some schools had insufficient ventilation and that there was no reduction in elementary school class sizes—with only 1 metre of distancing specified between desks.
Lecce stated that the distance of desks was in conjunction with the use of masks.
The hashtag "#UnsafeSeptember" was used on Twitter to publicize concerns regarding the back-to-school plan.
A poll conducted by Maru/Blue in mid-August suggested 38% of parents surveyed were not going to send their children back to school, and a majority believed they stood with teachers and that there should be a staggered start to the school year.
On August 26, details were issued regarding how positive cases will be handled.
In the event of a positive case, the entire cohort will be dismissed and required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Students may return to class if they have not developed symptoms during the 14-day period.
However, they will not be required to receive a test.
Schools may be shut down entirely if the local health unit determines that "potential widespread transmission" is occurring.
The same day, the federal government announced a $2 billion funding toward schools in Canada, of which Ontario will receive $763 million with the first tranche of $381 million arriving in the fall.
The Toronto District School Board, Canada's largest, debated and later decided to delay the reopening of schools until September 15, one week later than the initial September 8 date.
A survey by the board suggested 70 percent of students would be returning to in class school and 30 percent of students would be opting for learning from home.
On September 8, the first day of public school for many parts of the province, at least COVID-19 cases reported in Ottawa-area Catholic schools and teachers in a Mississauga Catholic school refusing work until proper personal protective equipment was provided.
On September 11, the Ontario government released a website to track COVID-19 infections in public schools and daycares.
By the end of the second week of school reopening, the government has reported 72 cases of COVID-19 in 60 schools and one school closure in Pembroke in Renfrew County in Eastern Ontario.
The last day of class for public schools in 2020 was December 18, the province closed the fall semester with 7,292 cases reported in public schools.
Before the winter break, there more than 20 schools closed in addition to all public schools in the Windsor-Essex region.

====
Winter/
Spring 2021 Semester ====
Due to Provincewide Shutdown, all public schools in the northern half of the province were closed to in-person classes until at least January 11, 2021, and the southern half of the province until at least January 25, 2021.
Some schools in the north voluntarily remained closed as a precaution.
On January 12, the return to in-person classes in Hamilton, Peel, Toronto, Windsor-Essex, and York was delayed to February 10, 2021, as they were still considered hotspots.
On January 20, it was announced that only seven school boards would resume on January 25.On February 3, it was announced that most remaining schools outside of Peel, Toronto, and York would return to in-person class on February 8.
In-person classes in Peel, Toronto, and York would return on February 16 after the Family Day holiday.
On February 11, it was announced that March break would be delayed to the week of April 12 ("April Break") in order to prevent community transmission via non-essential travel and gatherings.
Amid the second shutdown and the third wave, the provincial government stated that it was its "firm belief" that in-person classes needed to continue, as they were "critical to student mental health", and that "due to our strong infection prevention measures, 99 per cent of students and staff have no active cases of COVID-19, however we must remain vigilant and keep our guard up in order to keep schools safe and open."
However, on April 5,  Peel Medical Officer of Health Lawrence Loh announced the closure of all schools in the Peel region for at least two weeks beginning April 6 (dates including April Break), in an order issued pursuant to Section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act.
Later that day, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health announced that the Medical Officer of Health Nicola Mercer would issue a similar order on April 6.
On April 6, Toronto Medical Officer of Health Eileen de Villa also issued a Section 22 for the same duration.
On April 11, Minister of Education Stephen Lecce stated in a letter to parents that most schools in Ontario would continue in-person classes after April Break, despite the new stay-at-home order.
However, Lecce backtracked the next day, and Premier Ford announced that all schools in Ontario must close indefinitely.
Private schools must transition to virtual learning by April 15, and public schools will transition after April Break.
Child care will remain available for non-school aged children and the school-aged children of essential workers.

Lifting of restrictions after the first wave ===
On May 14, 2020, it was announced that Stage 1 of Ontario's lifting of restrictions would take begin May 20, focusing primarily on "workplaces that are well-positioned to follow public health advice to maintain physical distancing, implement workplace safety guidance and limit gatherings".
Certain outdoor recreation activities that are part of Stage 1 were allowed to resume on May 16, for the Victoria Day long weekend.
On June 8, it was announced that Stage 2 would be implemented across most of the province, excluding 10 Southern Ontario health regions primarily in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and along the Canada–United States border (such as Windsor-Essex County) due to a large number of active cases.
In addition, Ford announced that the cap on gathering sizes would be increased to 10 province-wide regardless of phase, and that there would be a moratorium on evictions through the end of August of small businesses which are eligible for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program.
On June 15, the Durham, Halton, Haldimand-Norfolk, Hamilton, Lambton, Niagara, and York health regions were allowed to enter Stage 2.On June 22, it was announced that Peel and Toronto would be allowed to enter Stage 2 on June 24.
Windsor-Essex was still excluded from Stage 2 due to outbreaks involving the agriculture industry.
On June 24, it was announced that most of Windsor-Essex would be allowed to enter Stage 2 on June 25, excluding Kingsville and Leamington.
On July 3, Premier Ford stated that he did not have a specific timetable for Stage 3; "You see what's happening [in the United States] when you move too quickly, you see what's happening south of the border.
We don't want that happening up here.
"By
August 12, after a region-by-region roll-out, all regions in Ontario had entered Stage 3.
On September 8, in response to growing case numbers, the provincial government announced a moratorium on further lifting of restrictions (such as expansion of "social circles" and gatherings) for at least four weeks, besides those already ongoing (such as schools, and reopening of selected casinos on September 26).

===
First provincewide shutdown (December 26, 2020 – January 25, 2021) ===
On December 21, 2020, Premier Ford announced that in order to "save lives and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed in the coming weeks", a "strict" Provincewide Shutdown would begin in all health regions (regardless of their current status on the response framework) at 12:01 a.m. ET on December 26, 2020 (Boxing Day).
This measure will last for 28 days.
It was originally to last only 14 days in the northern regions of the province (north of Sudbury), but on January 7, 2021 it was announced that the Provincewide Shutdown will be extended in these regions to the same length as in Southern Ontario.
Indoor social gatherings that involve people from outside of one's immediate household are prohibited.
Outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people with social distancing.
All non-essential businesses, retail outlets (which include all businesses deemed non-essential under the "Lockdown" tier of the response framework, as well as hardware stores and pet shops), cultural amenities, sports and recreation facilities (unless "being used by high-performance athletes and specified professional leagues"), and personal care services must close to the public.
Essential retail businesses are subject to capacity limits stricter than those used under Lockdown (50% for supermarkets and pharmacies, 25% for liquor stores and allowable big-box stores that sell groceries).
Bars and restaurants are prohibited from offering dine-in service.
All drive-in or drive-through events are prohibited, excluding drive-in religious services.
All publicly-funded schools remained closed to in-person classes (resuming remotely after the holiday break) until January 11, 2021 in Northern Ontario, and January 25, 2021 in Southern Ontario.
Elementary schools were originally slated to reopen in Southern Ontario on January 11, but on January 7, it was announced that this would be delayed.

===
Stay-at-home order (January 14 – March 8, 2021) ===
On January 12, 2021, citing models forecasting that Ontario's health care system will be "overwhelmed" with cases and mortality exceeding those of the first wave unless actions are taken, Premier Ford declared a second provincial state of emergency and announced stricter province-wide measures, to take effect on January 14 at 12:01 a.m. ET and last through at least February 11.
These measures upgraded the Provincewide Shutdown to a stay-at-home order; all Ontario residents were required to remain at their homes unless conducting an activity deemed essential.
Essential activities include shopping at grocery stores or pharmacies, receiving health care, exercise, or conducing essential work that cannot be performed remotely.
All employees were required to work from home if they have the capability of doing so.
The province states that what is considered "essential work" is based on "[the] best judgement and common sense of employers".
Performing arts facilities were required to cease all operations, even for virtual streaming concerts.
All other restrictions enacted under Provincewide Shutdown remained in force, and the colour-coded response framework was officially considered "paused" due to the declaration of emergency.
Certain businesses, such as liquor stores, hardware stores, and stores offering delivery or curbside pickup services, were required to close from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. nightly.
Non-essential construction activity was also suspended.
Outdoor gatherings were limited to five people, and guidance now recommends masks be worn outside (in addition to the existing indoor mandate) if social distancing is not possible.
The closure of schools in Hamilton, Peel, Toronto, Windsor-Essex, and York was further-extended to February 10.The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), municipal police departments, bylaw officers, and provincial workspace inspectors, had the authority to issue tickets to enforce the stay-at-home order and mask mandate, however they will not have the authority to stop drivers or pedestrians for questioning.
Premier Ford stated plans for a compliance "blitz" of retail store inspections beginning the weekend of January 15.
Results of the inspection "blitz" revealed 36 of 110 stores visited in violation of COVID-19 measures, or 70% compliance rate.
The measures faced criticism for disproportionately favouring big box retailers, by not restricting the times of day in which they may offer curbside pickup or delivery services, or preventing them from selling non-essential goods.
It also does not include funding to cover paid sick leave for essential and low-wage workers.
On February 8, 2021, Premier Ford announced that the declaration of emergency would expire, but that the stay-at-home order would be extended in the majority of health regions to allow a gradual reinstatement of the response framework.
The order was first lifted on February 10 in Eastern Ontario's Hastings Prince Edward Public Health Unit, the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Health Unit, and the Renfrew County and District Health Unit.
The stay-at-home order was expected to be lifted in most of Ontario on February 16, excluding Peel, Toronto, and York (expected to occur on February 22), and any other area where the province believes it is not yet safe to lift the order.
This was later amended to exclude York and include North Bay-Parry Sound.
Even as the restriction is lifted, the province still encourages residents to stay at home whenever possible, and discourages social gatherings and non-essential travel (including travel between regions with different levels on the response framework).
On February 19, 2021, York region was announced to be moving to Red (Control) on February 22 while Toronto, Peel and North Bay-Parry Sound were to remain in a stay-at-home order until at least March 8.
On March 5, 2021 the provincial government announced these last three regions would be moving to the response framework on March 8, officially ending stay-at-home orders originally in effect since January 14, 2021.
===
Regional advisory system ===


====
Use during the second wave from November 7 – December 26, 2020 ====
On November 3, 2020, Premier Ford stated that future modifications of restrictions during the second wave will be performed regionally using a colour-coded "response framework".
The framework went into place on November 7.On November 11, it was reported by the Toronto Star that the Ford government had allegedly ignored recommendations by Public Health Ontario regarding the metrics used for the advisory system — which were four times narrower than what was actually implemented by the government.
Two days later, Premier Ford announced that the thresholds for each level would be decreased: for example, the criteria for the "Control" (Red) level was reduced from a weekly incidence rate of 100 or more per-capita, to 40 or more.
Regions included in each tier were adjusted to match the new thresholds effective November 16.
Ford stated that the original criteria was based on earlier models that had anticipated only 950–1,250 new cases per day by the time it was implemented and that he would not have used them if case numbers had reached the point they had on November 10.
====
Use during the third wave beginning February 8, 2021 ====
Due to the declaration of emergency and a stay-at-home order issued, the response framework was officially considered paused from December 26, 2020 to February 9, 2021.
On February 8, 2021, Premier Ford announced that the response framework would be gradually reinstated to replace the stay-at-home order, beginning with the Hastings Prince Edward Public Health Unit, the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Health Unit, and the Renfrew County and District Health Unit on February 10 (which reopened into the "Prevent" tier).
Unlike the earlier revision, the "Lockdown" tier will allow for non-essential retail with capacity limits (unless the region is subject to a stay-at-home
order).The framework is now subject to an emergency brake, where regions may immediately be placed back in the "Lockdown" tier as a circuit breaker if health officials believe that the incidence rate is increasing too rapidly and the healthcare system is at a severe risk of being overwhelmed.
As of March 26, health officials may impose a stricter lockdown (equivalent to the earlier Provincewide Shutdown) under the emergency brake as well.
On March 20, further amendments to the response framework were implemented for restaurants; outdoor dining is now permitted in regions in the "Lockdown" tier, and capacity limits for restaurants in the "Control" and "Restrict" tiers were increased from 10 and 50 customers respectively to 50 and 100, or 50% capacity, whichever is lower.

Additional modifications were announced on March 26; as of March 29, the "Lockdown" category began to allow outdoor fitness classes of up to 10 people.
Personal care services were to be allowed operate by-appointment
only at 25% capacity/5 people (whichever is fewer) in "Lockdown" regions beginning April 12.
In addition, subject to physical distancing, capacity limits were removed for outdoor religious services (including funerals and weddings) in all regions.

Regions in the response framework ====


===
Second provincewide shutdown and stay-at-home order (April 3 – May 20, 2021) ===
On April 1, 2021, amid rising new infections, particularly exacerbated by variants of concern and preceding the Easter weekend, Premier Ford announced a second province-wide shutdown beginning April 3.
All regions were moved to a new sixth level of the response framework, "Shutdown" (white), re-imposing measures that were introduced during the first provincewide shutdown.
This includes prohibiting all indoor organized events and gatherings, limiting outdoor gatherings to five people, capacity limits for retail (50% for essential retail, 25% for all other stores), and ordering the closure of all in-person dining (regardless of setting), daycamps, personal care services, sports and recreation facilities, meeting and event spaces, and cinemas, and capping capacity of religious services to 15%.
All performing arts facilities must close, even for internet streaming events.
The response framework is paused.
Premier Ford faced criticism over the new shutdown (which resulted in only minor changes for health regions already in the "Lockdown" tier), with Leader of the Opposition Andrea Horwath arguing that it was "a too little too late response by this government to what we knew was coming".
On April 4, the medical officers of Ottawa, Peel Region, and Toronto sent a letter to the government requesting that a stay-at-home order be issued.
On April 7, 2021, Premier Ford declared a third state of emergency and announced that a second stay-at-home order will take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on April 8, and last for four weeks.
All Ontario residents must remain at their homes unless conducting an activity deemed essential.
Essential activities include shopping at grocery stores or pharmacies, receiving health care, exercise, school, or conducting essential work that cannot be performed remotely.
All employees must work from home if they have the capability of doing so.
Ford explained that "the situation is evolving rapidly, hour by hour.
And as things change, as we learn more about these deadly new variants, as we see new problems arise, we need to adapt.
We need to move quickly and decisively.
And right now, above all else, our plan is to get needles in the arms and protect our hospitals.
"All
shutdown restrictions and all other restrictions from the previous stay-at-home order apply.
Furthermore, essential retail stores are only allowed to sell food, pharmacy items, and cleaning supplies, and all other non-essential goods are prohibited from being displayed or sold to in-store customers.
In addition, retailers of assistive devices, automotive and equipment rental services, motor vehicle and boat dealers, vehicle and equipment repair services, prescription eyewear, safety supplies, and telecom services may operate at 25% capacity by appointment only.
Following criticism of photos showing displays of cloth masks blocked by local Walmart stores, representatives of the government clarified that they were considered an essential good.
The order does not include paid sick leave; Premier Ford accused those advocating for paid sick leave of "playing politics", and not directing people to the Canadian Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)
instead (which is a retroactive payment), which he deemed sufficient.

====
Extension of the stay-at-home order and further restrictions ====
On April 16, Premier Ford announced that due to record high hospitalizations and cases, the stay-at-home order had been extended through at least May 20, and that several additional restrictions will also be imposed.
Effective April 17, outdoor gatherings with anyone from outside of the immediate household are prohibited, all outdoor recreation amenities must close, allowable "big box" retail stores are restricted to 25% capacity, and all non-essential construction projects must be suspended.
Beginning April 19, land travel into Ontario is restricted at the provincial border to essential purposes (transport of goods, medical care, work, and exercising treaty rights) only, and indoor places of worship are limited to 10 people.
Furthermore, Solicitor General Sylvia Jones announced that police would receive enhanced authority to enforce the stay-at-home order, including being able to perform random stops of individuals they suspect are travelling in violation of the stay-at-home order.
They could compel individuals to state their home address and purpose of travel; failure to comply with a request for this information would be a ticketable offence.
Premier Ford stated that "I have never shied away from telling you the brutal honest truth, never shied away from tough decisions and today I am here to do just that.
My friends we are losing the battle between variants and vaccines", and that "we need to step up enforcement and we need to focus on those who are deliberately putting others at risk by ignoring the stay-at-home order.
"The
new measures faced criticism; the province did not introduce paid sick leave, the new police authority was criticized for resembling carding and having a disproportionate impact to BIPOC communities, while a number of municipal police departments announced that they would not perform random stops under the measure.
On April 17, Jones announced that the new police authority would be narrowed to only allow them to stop and ticket individuals they suspect are participating in a public event or social gathering.
Despite the changes, the revised measures elicited continued concerns.
Also amid criticism, the province backpedaled on restricting playgrounds as part of the prohibition of outdoor recreation.
On April 20, Peel Public Health issued a Section 22 order effective April 23, requiring any business that has been linked to five or more
COVID-19 infections within the past 14 days to shut down for 10 days.
All employees of the business must self-isolate for the duration, and it is "strongly recommended" that impacted employees be provided with paid leave.
Peel Public Health stated that "workplace exposures in Peel Region continue to drive the region’s high case counts of COVID-19.
Expedited closure will also allow Peel Public Health to investigate workplace exposures without risk of continued spread.
"
This order will not apply to healthcare, schools, or other "critical infrastructure".
Toronto Public Health subsequently issued a nearly identical order.
On April 22, in his first public appearance since April 16, and while self-isolating due to being a close contact of a positive case within his staff, Premier Ford admitted that the new enforcement measures announced last Friday "went too far".
He also announced that Ontario was working on developing a paid sick leave benefit, arguing that they needed to fill "gaps" in the CRSB that were not fulfilled by the 2021 federal budget, and that they planned to make it "the best program in North America".

Vaccines ==


===
Timeline of rollout ===


====
Early rollout ====
On December 9, 2020, Health Canada approved the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
Vaccines were distributed amongst the provinces by the Federal government.
Ontario received an initial delivery of 6,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine of a total of 90,000 to be received before the end of 2020.
On December 14, the first vaccination was delivered in Ontario in Toronto, kicking off a vaccination rollout.
Vaccinations began December 14, 2020 in a pilot program to vaccinate health-care workers working in long-term care homes and later expanded to front-line health-care workers.
Ontario's vaccination task force later announced their plan to inoculate all long-term care home residents and staff in Toronto, Peel, York and Windsor-Essex with a goal date of January 21, 2021.
The government expanded this to all long-term care home residents in the province by February 15.On December 23, 2020, Health Canada approved the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna.
The first tranche of vaccines of a total 53,000 designated for Ontario by the end of 2020 arrived at Toronto Pearson International Airport on December 24.Over
the Christmas and holiday season, many vaccination clinics were paused.
The Ontario government has been criticized for this delay, the government officially responded that the cessation was due to staff shortages.
Rick Hillier, in charge of the Ontario vaccine task-force later apologized, calling the cessation a "mistake".
On December 29, 2020, he added that the task-force was looking into applying single doses of the Moderna vaccine in order to inoculate even more people more efficiently.
On January 15, 2021 it was announced all LTC homes in Toronto had been vaccinated.
On January 19, 2021, the Provincial government announced all LTC residents and staff in hot zones had received at least their first dose.
By February 14, 2021 the province announced it had completed at least first-dose vaccinations in all long-term care homes in Ontario.

====
Manufacturing delays ====
Due to manufacturing delays with Pfizer (aimed at retooling in order to speed up vaccine production), Ontario received a significant decline in vaccine delivery between late January and early February.
On January 29, 2021 another delay was announced with Moderna, who announced that a 20–25 percent cut in product would be delivered to Canada for the month of February.
On January 28, 2021, the Ontario government announced a major miscalculation in reported fully vaccinated people, over-reporting the number of fully vaccinated individuals.

====
Regular shipments and approval of new vaccines ===
=
By late February 2021, shipments for both Pfizer and Moderna increased significantly.
On February 26, 2021 the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was approved for use by Health Canada and on March 5, 2021, the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was approved for use by Health Canada.
Johnson & Johnson only requires one shot for administration.
Shipments of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in the province on March 3, 2021.
The government announced the creation of a pilot programme for administration through Ontario pharmacies to begin March 9, 2021.
The vaccines would originally only be used on those between the ages of 60–64 due to a lack of study on the vaccine's efficacy on adults over 65.
The pilot will take place in 380 pharmacies in Toronto, Kingston and Windsor-Essex.
The first shot of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was given March 10 in Toronto.
Registration began in the three regions at Shoppers Drug Mart, Rexall and Costco pharmacies.
The province announced another pilot programme involving family doctors administering the vaccine beginning March 13, 2021 in six regions including: Hamilton, Toronto, Wellington-Dufferin Guelph, Peterborough, Simcoe-Muskoka and Peel Region.
On March 22, 2021 it was announced restaurant workers (mostly young individuals) would be prioritized in Phase 2 of the provincial vaccine rollout.
In anticipation for moving into Phase 2 of the vaccine rollout in the province, vaccination appointments for older citizens in late March 2021 were hard to fill, partly due to vaccine hesitancy in older populations, and the online spread of misinformation by older populations.
This misinformation was exacerbated by NACI's opinion reversal on the safety of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and its potential side-effects of blood clots in post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events.
Due to recommendations from NACI, on March 29, 2021 Ontario later restricted use of AstraZeneca to those adults aged 55+.
====
Transition to Phase 2 ====
Following the departure of General Rick Hillier as the chair of the vaccine task-force on March 31, 2021, he was replaced by Doctor Homer Tien (head of ORNGE and a trauma surgeon).With a steady influx of vaccine shipments, the province began to open up eligibility, especially in the GTA.
Ontario officially moved to Phase 2 of its vaccine rollout strategy on April 6, 2021.
The first of these province-wide announcements included vaccinating adults with high-risk health conditions.
Following a sharp rise in new cases, exacerbated by COVID-19 variants, the province shifted focus to hot spot regions, particularly focused in Peel Region and Toronto, opening up eligibility to all adults aged 18 and older in certain postal codes.
In April, the Ford government was criticized by the opposition for leaving out much higher risk neighbourhoods through the choice of 114 postal codes for prioritization of 18+ vaccination.
The government responded saying it was an unnecessary politicization of the issue and that the postal codes were chosen from a study done by the Ontario Science Advisory Table.
The Advisory Table responded by saying they had chosen the postal codes to study, but did not recommend to the Progressive Conservative government that they prioritize those postal codes.
Instead they had recommended targeting age groups in specific hot spot neighbourhoods, using the postal codes as a metric to measure COVID-19 statistics.

====
Lowering of age limit for Oxford-AstraZeneca and vaccine ramp-up ====
Following the lowering of the age of 55 to 40 on April 20, 2021 for access to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Ontario began to achieve vaccination number milestones.
On April 21 2021, Ontario recorded 136,695 doses administered the previous day.
The shots were not being taken by the older population due to a combination of vaccine hesitancy and a preference for the other two vaccine brands, which has been called "vaccine shopping".
Vaccine Hunters Canada has been credited with the rapid uptake of the vaccine in Ontario among members of Generation X.On April 22,
2021 pregnant women were added to Phase 2's "highest risk" category for vaccine eligibility in Ontario after advocacy from Ontario OBGYN's and other medical professionals.

==
Hospitals ==
Throughout the pandemic, a concern about hospital capacity, and critical care like Intensive Care Unit beds has become a major issue at the peak of the three waves.
During the third wave, ICU capacity has reached near critical capacity.

Data as of April 27, 2021


==
Long-term care homes ==
On April 15, 2020, the Ontario Nurses' Association released a statement saying that long-term care (LTC) homes pre-COVID-19 were already understaffed, but now they are in "crisis" mode.
Prior to the pandemic, long-term care home staff who were part-time or casual staff were allowed to work at multiple locations, increasing the risk of transmission and spread between LTC homes.
The province issued a new Emergency Order on March 28 that introduced temporary additional staff members to help in the facilities and allowed homes more flexibility in staff deployment.
Many LTC homes in Ontario are considered old and small and feature shared bedrooms, increasing the difficulty in isolating sick residents from those who are well.

===
Inspections ===
On April 15, CBC reported that the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care had conducted resident quality inspections (RQI) at only nine out of 626 long-term care homes in the province in 2019, down from a bare majority in 2018 and larger proportions from 2015 to 2017.
RQIs are proactive, unannounced and more comprehensive than the other main category of care home inspections in the province, complaint and critical incident inspections, where facilities know of the impending scrutiny in advance; the 2018 Long Term Care Homes Public Inquiry noted that "focusing only on specific complaints or critical incidents could lead to missing systemic issues."
As of 15 April 2020, 114 care facilities in Ontario had experienced COVID-19 outbreaks, and those that had multiple COVID-19 deaths last had their RQI in 2018 or earlier.
===
Outbreaks ===
On April 7, Ontario reported that there are 51 long-term care homes in the province that are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, and by April 10, it had surged to 69 LTC homes in Ontario.
Some LTC workers pointed to a lack of personal protective equipment as a cause of the outbreaks.
By April 21, 121 outbreaks have been reported in long-term care homes.
On April 8, the Ontario Ministry of Health released directives to ramp up coronavirus testing and infection control.
Also, new residents entering a home must be isolated for 14 days and tested within that period.
The directives also require that all long-term care home staff and essential visitors for gravely ill residents wear surgical masks, "whether the home is in outbreak or not."
LTC homes are expected to take "all reasonable steps" to follow the new long-term care rules.
Prior to this directive, LTC staff were not required to wear masks or other PPE, and testing levels were considered low for at-risk seniors and LTC staff.
On April 28, Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam stated that as many of 79 percent of Canada's COVID-19 fatalities occurred in long-term care homes, with Ontario and Quebec accounting for most of the cases.
As part of Operation Laser, assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces at five Toronto-area nursing homes, beginning in April, led to a report by the Brigadier General in charge documenting extreme conditions and abuse.
The Ontario Ombudsman announced the launch an investigation into long-term care facilities on June 1.During the second wave of the pandemic, LTC homes began to experience outbreaks again.
Tendercare Living Centre in Scarborough for example has experienced 43 deaths related to COVID-19.
On December 25, 2020, North York General Hospital took over control of the home.

Data as of April 28, 2021


==
Variants of concern ==
The Ontario government has become aware of a number of Variants of SARS-CoV-2 arriving in Canada due to travel.
Many of which have been linked to a higher transmission rate, and potentially increased fatality rates.
The first confirmed case of the lineage B.1.1.7 variant (originating in the United Kingdom) was on December 21, 2020 infecting a Durham region couple initially with no known travel-related contact exposure.
The couple, Dr. Martina Weir and Brian Weir, who both work in healthcare, were later charged for lying to contact tracers, admitting later they had met with a traveller from the U.K., who should have been in quarantine.
Dr. Weir was later fired from her role.
The variant was later identified in a mass outbreak causing 71 deaths at a long-term care home in Barrie.
The first confirmed case of the 501.V2 variant (originating from South Africa) was on February 1, 2021.
The case had no known link to travel.
The first confirmed case of the Lineage P.1 variant (originating from Brazil) was announced February 7, 2021 in Toronto.
The patient, who was later hospitalized, had recently returned from travel in Brazil.

Testing ==
Public Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent.
The main laboratory is the top four floors of the MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto.

As of early April, accounting firm KPMG has been contracted to organize all the labs in the province that are capable of microbial testing.

In addition to the six public health labs, this includes 10 hospital networks and three private lab networks, including Dynacare and LifeLabs.
===
Access ===
Access to testing is set by Public Health Ontario who publishes a guidance document that defines the conditions for an individual to be tested.

Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.

The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing.

Starting in March, the public health units across the province have opened over 70 assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional.
These range from mobile units, to walk-up locations, to drive-through locations.
This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices.

If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing.
Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at long-term care facilities.
Since many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be substantially higher.
Unlike some countries, the number of suspected or probable infections is not reported by the Ontario government.
In an effort to reduce a burden on provincial assessment centres amid a continued surge in cases, Ford announced on September 23 announced that it would expand testing of asymptomatic people by-appointment into pharmacies across the province, beginning with 60 locations by September 25.
He also announced plans to deploy saliva-based rapid testing at three hospitals in Toronto.
Accordingly, the province announced on September 24 that it would discourage asymptomatic patients from receiving tests at assessment centres.

===
Amount of testing ===
In late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces.
As of early May 2020, among the larger provinces, Ontario is second to Alberta and ahead of British Columbia and Quebec in daily tests per capita.
In mid-April, polling firms Forum Research and Mainstreet Research released results of a pair of surveys about COVID-19 symptom prevalence and testing.
Four to five thousand Ontario households were randomly selected.
Of them, 2% of households contained someone who had been tested by April 12, increasing to 5% on April 19, whereas the incidence of COVID-19 symptoms in a household decreased from one in five to one in seven households.
The second survey indicated that one-third of Ontarians report an underlying condition that might aggravate a COVID-19 infection.

===
Testing capacity ===
Since January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR.
Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of reagent chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs.
To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted.
In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.
New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly.
Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal.

Testing capacity projections ====


====
Backlogs ====
On March 18, 2020, the Toronto Star reported that test results announced by the provincial government were several days old, with turnaround times increasing from 24 hours to 4 days, leading the government to "making decisions based on old information".
The province was only able to process around 2,000 tests per day by March 19, which caused the backlog.
The backlog increased to over 8,000 unprocessed samples on March 24 with patients waiting at least four days for results, partially due to fact that private and university laboratories are not allowed to process samples.
More backlogs emerged in September and October 2020 amid increased demand for tests and a heightened caseload, reaching 68,000 by the weekend of October 4.
On October 5, CBC News reported that COVID-19 tests administered at pharmacies were being sent to Quest Diagnostics laboratories in California for processing by means of the local partner for the scheme, In-Common Laboratories (ICL).

===
Management of testing in Ontario ===
Officials for Public Health Ontario include the following individuals:

Dr. Vanessa Allen, chief of medical microbiology with Public Health Ontario
Dr. Peter Donnelly, president and CEO of Public Health Ontario (on leave as of April 9, 2020)
Colleen Geiger, interim president and CEO of Public Health Ontario (as of April 9, 2020)
Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer
Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of healthIn early April, the Ministry of Health brought in a multinational accounting firm KPMG to assist in the organization and optimization of testing capacity in Ontario.
Premier Doug Ford said on April 8 that he was losing his patience with Ontario's inadequate testing numbers, showing testing capacity was not being fully utilized.
Later that day, the province appointed a former Toronto public health head, Dr. David McKeown to troubleshoot and rethink the province's response to the pandemic.
The following day on April 9, amid mounting criticism of the province's testing, the president and CEO of Public Health Ontario
Dr. Peter Donnelly temporarily stepped down for medical reasons and was replaced in the interim by Colleen Geiger, Public Health Ontario's chief of strategy, stakeholder relations, information and knowledge.

==
Criticism ==


===
Initial response ===
Regional public health experts suggested that Ontario's initial incremental response — adding new voluntary measures piece by piece — had been ineffective.
Businesses of all sizes remained open, and unnecessary social contacts continued.
Describing Ontario's efforts to battle COVID-19 as piecemeal and ineffective, Dr. Shanker Nesathurai, who was one of Ontario's 34 regional medical officers of health, urged his colleagues to band together and use more powerful measures to contain the pandemic than provincial leaders had endorsed by the third week of March.
In an email, Dr. Nesathurai, who worked for Haldimand Norfolk Health Unit, wrote on March 19 that Ontario's response had undermined the province's attempt to contain the outbreak, as businesses remain open and travellers ignore advice to self-isolate.

===
Protests ===
On April 25, 2020, there were small protests totalling 200 protesters in front of the Ontario Legislative Building in Queen's Park, Toronto, demanding that Doug Ford end all emergency measures.
Some of the protesters consider the coronavirus a hoax.
Ford called them "a bunch of yahoos.
"On
May 2, 2020
, there was another protest with 100 protesters in front of the Ontario Legislative Building.

=== Paid sick leave ===
The Progressive Conservative government has largely resisted calls to implement paid emergency leave for workers that fall ill due to COVID-19, and blocked legislation proposed by the opposition Ontario NDP.
Premier Ford stated that affected workers should use the federal Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB), which is retroactive and delayed, and argued that NDP leader Andrea Horwath wanted to "double dip into people’s pockets when there’s a program working and working well now".

COVID-19 cases in schools and daycares - Ontario
India began administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 16 January 2021.
As of 28 April 2021, India has administered 150,020,648 doses overall, including first and second does of the currently-approved vaccines.
Two vaccines received approval for emergency use in India at the onset of the program, including Covishield (a version of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India), and Covaxin (developed by Bharat Biotech).
In April 2021, Sputnik V was approved as a third vaccine, with deployment expected to begin by late-May 2021.

= Background and timeline ==
In September 2020, India's science minister Harsh Vardhan stated that the country planned to approve and begin distribution of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021.
The first recipients were to be 30 million health workers directly dealing with COVID patients.
On 1 January 2021, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved emergency usage of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which was being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) under the trade name "Covishield".
On 2 January, the DCGI approved Bharat Biotech's Covaxin for emergency use, even though it had not yet completed phase 3 trials.
India began its vaccination program began on 16 January 2021, operating 3,006 vaccination centres on the onset.
Each vaccination centre will offer either Covishield or Covaxin, but not both.
Some states have decided to primarily use Covishield, and keep their Covaxin doses as a “buffer stock”.
Since Covaxin has not completed phase-3 trials, those receiving it will need to sign a consent form.165,714 people were vaccinated on the first day of availability.
Difficulties in uploading beneficiary lists at some sites caused delays.
In the first three days, 631,417 people were vaccinated.
Of these, 0.18% reported side-effects and nine people (0.002%)
were admitted to hospitals for observation and treatment.
Within those first days, there was concerns about low turnout, due to a combination of vaccine safety concerns, technical problems with the software used, and misinformation.
The first phase of the rollout involved health workers and frontline workers including police, paramilitary forces, sanitation workers, and disaster management volunteers.
By 1 March, only 14 million healthcare and frontline workers had been vaccinated, falling short of the original goal of 30 million.
The next phase of the vaccine rollout covered all residents over the age of 60, residents between the ages of 45 and 60 with one or more qualifying comorbidities, and any health care or frontline worker that did not receive a dose during phase 1.
Online registration began on 1 March via the Aarogya Setu app and a web-based booking system.
From 1 April, eligibility was extended to all residents over the age of 45.On 8 April, amid the beginnings of a major second wave of infections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a four-day Teeka Utsav ("Vaccine Festival") from 11–14 April to mark the respective birthdays of Jyotirao Phule and B. R. Ambedkar, with a goal to increase the pace of the program by vaccinating as many eligible residents as possible.
By the end of the Utsav, India had reached a total of over 111 million vaccine doses to-date.
On 12 April, the DCGI approved Russia's Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use in India.
A phase 3 trial had been conducted in the country in September 2020, which showed 91.6% efficacy.
The local distributor Dr. Reddy's Laboratories stated that it planned to have the vaccine available in India by late-
May 2021.On 19 April
, it was announced that the next phase of the vaccine program will begin on 1 May, extending eligibility to all residents over the age of 18.

On 25 April, India became the fastest country to administer 140 million doses.
On 28 April 2021, the Government  of India opened registrations from age groups 18 and above.
Nearly 1.33 crore (13.3 million) people registered in a single day for vaccination on the CoWIN website.
== Vaccine development and distribution ==
As of early May 2020, there were over 30 vaccine candidates in development in India, many of which were already in pre-clinical trials.
The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is the world's largest vaccine maker, and this existing capacity enabled India to be a major participant in the COVAX program to distribute vaccines to developing countries.
In February 2020, SII had begun animal trials of vaccine candidates.
SII announced in April 2020 that it would apply for clinical trials from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April 2020.
SII president Adar Poonawalla said that a vaccine would be delivered within a year, but projected an efficacy between 70 to 80%.
SII received approvals for phase 2 and phase 3 trials of its version of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford's Vaccitech in August 2020.
SII joined GAVI in a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to produce 100 million doses of vaccine for developing countries.
Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with U.S.-based FluGen, expected to begin the first clinical trials of a nasal vaccine by late-2020.
The Indian Council of Medical Research partnered with Bharat Biotech in May 2020 to develop a COVID vaccine entirely within India.
In June 2020, it received DCGI approval to begin phase 1 and phase 2 trials on its vaccine, BBV152 (trade name "Covaxin").
In September 2020, it was reported that in pre-clinical trials on animals, Covaxin was able to build immunity.
On 3 March 2021, Bharat Biotech reported that Covaxin showed an efficacy of 81% in its phase 3 trial.
On 20 April 2021, Bharat Biotech announced that it had expanded its production capabilities for Covaxin to 700 million doses per-year.
Cadila Healthcare began vaccine development in March 2020, including a viral vector vaccine and a DNA plasmid vaccine.

In mid-July 2020, Cadila held early human trials of its vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D, and received approval for phase 3 trials in January 2021.
It began large-scale production in April 2021, with Cadila expecting to receive emergency authorisation by MayJune 2021.In September 2020, Dr. Reddy's partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund to conduct phase 3 trials of the Sputnik V vaccine in India, and to distribute the vaccine there once approved.
===
Global distribution ===
In January 2021, India began a humanitarian initiative known as Vaccine Maitri (vaccine friendship), which aims to leverage the country's pharmaceutical industry to export Indian-manufactured vaccines to other countries.
The Ministry of External Affairs stated that since 20 January, India had donated over 5.5 million vaccines to neighbouring countries such as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka, and that the country was also planning to send doses to Africa, Nicaragua, Oman, the Caribbean Community, and the COVAX programme, and to distribute vaccines to other countries via commercial exports.
A spokesperson of the MEA stated that "In line with the prime minister's announcement that India sees international cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic as its duty, we have played the role of the first responder in our neighbourhood as well as undertaken supplies to countries beyond."
In response to these donations, Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres stated that he "strongly hope[s] that India will have all the instruments that are necessary to play a major role in making sure that a global vaccination is campaign is made possible", and went on to say that "I think that the production capacity of India is the best asset that the world has today.
I hope the world understands that it must be fully used.
"As
of 10 March 2021, India had distributed over 58 million vaccine doses to 65 nations through the scheme.

You should know about the Coronavirus Vaccine
The COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first imported case in Cambodia was detected in Sihanoukville on 27 January 2020.
Although a number of imported cases and transmission to direct contacts were confirmed throughout 2020, no community transmission was detected until 29 November.
The public health response is led by the Ministry of Health with support from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and Institute Pasteur du Cambodge.
Contact tracing, quarantining, screening of arrivals and public messaging related to hygiene, social distancing and mask wearing have been central to the containment strategy.
According to Global Health Security Index's report in 2019, Cambodia ranked 89th out of 195 countries in preparedness for infectious disease outbreak.
Cambodia's initial response was slow - during the initial outbreak in China, few international travel restrictions were introduced, Cambodian citizens were not evacuated from Wuhan and Prime Minister Hun Sen downplayed the threat.
Cambodia allowed passengers of cruise ship MS Westerdam to disembark in February after it was refused entry to other countries.
Starting in March as the pandemic spread globally, Cambodia established its national response committee, introduced restrictions on arrival, closed education institutions, garment factories and entertainment venues, and major public holidays were cancelled.
A controversial State of Emergency Law was passed in April but has not been implemented as of April 2021.
Most restrictions within the country were lifted by September.
In November, some restrictions were reinstated in Phnom Penh and thousands of Cambodian government employees and contacts went into quarantine following a one day-visit by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who tested positive after arriving in Bangkok.
On 29 November, the first community transmission cluster was detected in Phnom Penh, with the virus suspected to have entered the country sometime during October and circulated undetected.
The country began its vaccination programme and detected its largest outbreak to date in February 2021.
Cambodia reported its first death on 11 March 2021.
As Lineage B.1.1.7 spread in the capital's markets and garment factories, a curfew was later strengthened to the country's first lockdown across the entirety of Phnom Penh and Takhmau in April 2021 as the WHO warned Cambodia's healthcare system was at risk of becoming overwhelmed.
Criticism has also included Prime Minister Hun Sen's downplaying of the risk of an outbreak during the early stages of the pandemic, persecution of critics and lack of widespread community testing and surveillance protocols, particularly in overcrowded prisons.
The pandemic has had a severe impact on the economy, notably the tourism and garment sectors, with projections of a lasting increase in poverty, debt and unemployment.

==
Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

Timeline ==


===
January–February - first case and docking of MS Westerdam ===
At 3 p.m. on 31 January, the first case had been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family.
Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital.
On 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia.
The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as him, most have since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remains under quarantine.
The cruise ship MS Westerdam was reportedly taking 1,455 passengers and 802 crew around Asia, 651 of whom were U.S citizens.
It was previously docked in Hong Kong, around the time it was badly hit by the virus.
The Westerdam arrived in Sihanoukville on 13 February after it had been turned away by four countries due to virus concerns.
About 20 passengers on board, who were unwell, took clinical tests but the vast majority had their temperature taken and filled out a form.
Most of these passengers then disembarked.
This move was praised by the World Health Organization (WHO), who called it an "example of international solidarity".
No officials or passengers implemented social distancing or mask wearing during the ceremony, and passengers were later encouraged to tour around Phnom Penh.
Of 145 Westerdam passengers who stopped in Malaysia by plane on 15 February, an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus, leading to concern that other passengers may also have been infected.
By only then, the remaining of 781 passengers were isolated and taken clinical tests, and still, the Westerdam was criticized as it was not designed for quarantine and the passengers were able to socialize.

A comedian based in Oregon who was hired to perform on the Westerdam was said to have flouted the quarantine by sneaking a flight back to Seattle.
However, he averred that the quarantine never took place and was cleared by US CDC on both ends.
Later tests on the American woman who had already returned home showed negative as she never had carried the virus after all, US CDC stated on 6 March.
While the CDC had not tested the woman directly, it was confirmed that after the patient's initial positive result, two subsequent tests came back negative.
It wasn't clear why she initially tested positive for COVID-19, though CDC officials have said she might have had other respiratory illness.

=== 1-15
March 2020 - imported cases ===
On 7 March, the second case of the coronavirus was detected in a 38-year-old man, a Cambodian in Siem Reap.
He was among four people (three of the man's relatives and a Japanese woman) placed under quarantine at Siem Reap Provincial Referral Hospital, all of whom had direct contact with a Japanese man in his 40s who left Cambodia on 3 February and tested positive upon arrival in his country at Chubu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname, Aichi.
Meanwhile, some 40 other people in the same city had been isolated under medical supervision since indirect contacts with the same Japanese man.

The government prompted its decision to close all schools and cancelled the upcoming Songkran in the city.
On 10 March, the Ministry of Health confirmed the country's third case.
At 4:30 p.m., a 65-year-old British woman had tested positive for the virus in Kampong Cham.
She was a passenger of a cruise ship named Viking Cruise Journey, which travelled from Ho Chi Minh City to Kampong Cham City.
The woman took a flight from London straight to Hanoi on 2 March then
another flight to Ho Chi Minh City with four other people, all British.
Arriving to Phnom Penh on 7 March via the cruise, it was reported that a Vietnamese woman, who was seated next to the group on the plane from London, had carried the virus.
The group of five were taken samples for testing.
Two of them refused, claiming that they were healthy and having no symptoms, until the cruise ship reached Kampong Cham on 9 March.
Following the event, the boat had been docked to provide samples to be tested from all 29 other passengers and 34 crew and were they placed under quarantine in a hotel somewhere in the city.
The British patient was transferred to Royal Phnom Penh Hospital in Phnom Penh at her own request, adding that she had been conducted with coordination from WHO.
On 12 March, another cases of two passengers of Viking Cruise Journey were publicly confirmed at noon to have tested positive in a British man, 73 and his wife, 69, bringing up to five the confirmed cases at the time.
Due to their ages, the married couple were transferred to Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh.
On 13 March, health officials confirmed two cases in Phnom Penh at 8 p.m. sharp, tallying to seven in total.
A 49-year-old Canadian and a 33-year-old Belgian were in quarantine in Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital.
The authorities were trying to locate those who had contacts with the patients.
For the time being, another two visitors to Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (A British and his friend, a Canadian woman who worked in China) were suspected to have the symptoms and admitted to the said hospital.
A British man, however, made an escape but was found later in Kampot and hospitalized there.
They were tested negative, assuming it was just a fever they had.
Nevertheless, their self-monitoring was needed for any changes.
All cruise ships had since been prohibited to enter the country through K'am Samnar checkpoint and any other checkpoints.

===
14–25 March - restrictions come into place ===
In 14 March, MOEYS published an article, declaring that they would have to shut down all educational institutes in Phnom Penh until further notice, so did an NGO of where the Belgian man had been working at.
On 16 March, it was announced the closure of all educational institutions would be expanded nationwide.
According to  a Ministry of Health press release, Cambodia announced a ban on all entries from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the United States, thereby all visas would be undeniably suspended.
This policy would be held for thirty days, effective on 17 March.
Iran was added to the list of countries whose nationals were suspended entry to Cambodia the following day, making a total of six.
This would take effect on 18 March.
On 15 March, an additional case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Phnom Penh at 5 p.m. sharp on a French man, 35.
With his wife and his four-month-old baby, the family flew from Paris to Singapore on 13 March.
Showing signs of fever, the authorities there took his samples for examination.
To wait for the results, he wasn't allowed to go any further, however as a follow-up health checkup was presented, he was informed that he could carry on and the results would be available accordingly.
The family were off, landed at Phnom Penh International Airport on the morning of 14 March.
The same day, the test came back positive.
As of 15 March, the man was admitted to Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital while his wife and child, were staying at home of a relative under medical supervision.
Contacts with the man were found in the plane he boarded, in total of 24 passengers (including him and his family), and another two transporters who drove them home, to be examined.

Impact ==
United Nations Development Programme predicted in October 2020 that the poverty rate in Cambodia could double to 17.6% and unemployment could rise to 4.8% as a result of the COVID-19 recession.
The economy is projected to shrink by 5.5% in 2020, following 7% growth in 2019.According to Asian Development Bank, around 390,000 people were estimated to have lost their jobs.
Closure of garment factories alone, Cambodia's biggest employer, have left at least 100,000 people unemployed.
Many Cambodians are indebted to microfinance institutions, putting them at risk of falling into poverty  if loan repayments cannot be met.
Around 86,000 Cambodian migrant workers returned from Thailand as border closures took effect, with minimal employment opportunities upon their return.
The pandemic severely impacted the tourism sector in Cambodia as international travel was disrupted by restrictions and all tourist visas were suspended.
The coastal tourism hub of Sihanoukville was impacted by a drop in arrivals from China.
In Siem Reap, ticket sales for Angkor National Park dropped to an average of 22 people per day during April, leaving Angkor Wat, typically bustling with thousands of tourists, almost empty.

Over 3 million children were affected by school closures.
UNICEF stressed that adjusting to online learning disadvantages rural poor children in Cambodia, and the disruptions to education during the pandemic could have a long-lasting impact.
Lockdown restrictions and enforcement in April 2021 caused disruptions to Phnom Penh food supplies and led to tens of thousands of requests for food aid across the city.

==
Humanitarian assistance ==
On 23 March 2020, a team of seven specialist physicians from southern China's Guangxi with medical supplies, including ventilators, medical masks, protective suits, test kits, and infrared temperature sensors, had landed in Phnom Penh to assist tackling the pandemic.

On 1 April 2021, Japan aided the country 1 million USD through UNICEF for boosting process of vaccination programme.

== Reception ==
During the early stages of the pandemic, it was reported that Prime Minister Hun Sen was downplaying the pandemic and Cambodia was not responding in an effort to maintain its close diplomatic and economic relationship with China.
In February, Hun Sen downplayed the risk of the virus at a press conference, suggesting the virus was sensationalized by the media and threatened to expel those present who were wearing masks.
Hun Sen also visited China to show Cambodia's support in its response, and offered to visit Wuhan specifically.
Unlike most other countries, Cambodia did not cease travel to and from China and did not evacuate its overseas citizens from Wuhan during the initial outbreak there.
During a press conference on 27 July 2020, at the six month mark of the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom praised Cambodia for its success in "preventing [a] large scale outbreak", along with New Zealand, Rwanda, Vietnam and Thailand.
The WHO also praised Cambodia's welcoming of the MS Westerdam.
Concerns have been raised about the lack of widespread community testing in Cambodia.
In April, testing was reportedly restricted to travelers or those with contact to known COVID-19 cases.
"
Regular flu" cases were not being tested.
The lack of transparency was highlighted in the wake of the Hungarian Foreign Minister's visit in November, as were the breach in safety protocols during the meetings.
A number of people travelling from Cambodia have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in other countries.
No prisoners were tested for COVID-19 despite coming into contact with officials who tested positive, which was criticized by the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, particularly as Cambodia's prisons are often overcrowded.
Prisons director Nuth Savna told VOD in December that several prisoners had fever but still did not test them, dismissing this as due to the change in weather.
Some experts have suggested that COVID-19 may be circulating undetected in the country.
Others have suggested that the hot weather and open-air society have kept transmission low.
On 30 March 2020, Human Rights Watch criticized local authorities for engaging in "inflammatory rhetoric against vulnerable groups and foreigners", including having specifically referred to groups (such as Khmer Islam) as the subject of positive cases in a 17 March Facebook post (which incited discriminatory comments), and having blamed foreigners for its spread.
It has also criticized the Cambodian government for using emergency measures to restrict freedoms, including "baseless" arrests of critics and opposition supporters for "incitement" or dissemination of "fake news", including members of the Cambodian National Rescue Party, and an online journalist who merely quoted a speech by Prime Minister Hun Sen on social media.
In April 2021, Phnom Penh police were criticised by Cambodian human rights groups and Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith for implementing caning to punish violators of the city's lockdown restrictions.
Human rights groups, and a group of UN special rapporteurs for human rights also expressed concern over the severity of punishments for lockdown violations.

COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the government of the Philippines through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).

The strictest of these community quarantines is the "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ), which effectively is a total lockdown.

==
Background ==
Given the rapidly increasing number of cases in Metro Manila,
Albay 2nd district representative Joey Salceda proposed a week-long lockdown of the region to prevent the disease from spreading nationwide.
Salceda specifically proposed the closure of the Philippine expressway network and public transportation accessing the region, in addition to the suspension of classes and work.
President Duterte initially rejected the proposal claiming it would "hamper the flow of basic commodities".
Secretary Duque, however, raised the possibility of a lockdown on certain cities or towns if cases of community-based transmissions are reported, but not an entire region.
On March 12, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering Metro Manila, that began on March 15.

At one point during President Rodrigo Duterte's pronouncement about the Metro Manila "community quarantine," he said that "they are afraid to call it a lockdown, but it is a lockdown."
This statement left many confused.
His cabinet secretary, Karlo Nograles, later made it clear that the proper term is "community quarantine" and the President's comment means that the event "is like a lockdown".
Nograles further said that the term "lockdown" can lead to different interpretations, while "community quarantine" is a technical term that medical authorities can give meaning, which does not create public fear.
When the "community quarantine" was applied to Luzon, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo, said that the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) is equivalent to an "absolute lockdown or total lockdown."
Secretary Eduardo Año of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) also said that "enhanced community quarantine" should be considered as a "total lockdown.
"In
addition, President Duterte advised local government units outside of the National Capital Region to implement a community quarantine in cases where, in a given level of local government, at least two COVID-19 cases are confirmed within a lower level of its jurisdiction; for example, a province-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
COVID-19 cases confirmed within different cities or municipalities in the same province, while a city/municipality-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
COVID-19 cases confirmed within different barangays in the same city or municipality.
Local government units were also authorized to utilize their quick response funds upon declaration of a state of emergency.
The national government has given local government units under enhanced community quarantine in Visayas and Mindanao and relevant field offices of the Department of Health the power to lift or extend the lockdown period in their jurisdiction.
The imposition of a "localized lockdown" involving measures at the barangay, sitio, and/or purok level instead of fully lifting ECQs has been proposed.
On April 6, the following localities were under enhanced community quarantine: all regions of Luzon, Western Visayas, Caraga Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, Samar, Biliran, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, Sultan Kudarat, Lanao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Cotabato, South Cotabato, Tawi-Tawi, and the municipality of Catarman in Northern Samar.
On April 24, it was clarified that local government units can no longer impose quarantine measures without the consent of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
Prior to that period, localities could impose such measures with coordination with the DILG.
President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order 112, extending enhanced community quarantine in select localities until May 15 and imposing a general community quarantine in the rest of the country, also overriding existing quarantine measures by local government units, starting May 1.
==
Classification ==
The four main levels of community quarantine measures are the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ), the general community quarantine (GCQ), and the modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).
Although exact measures per level may vary over time due to the government revising its guidelines, the strictest of these measures is the ECQ and the most lenient being the MGCQ.

===
Enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) ===
Localities under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) are generally ordered to stay at home, with its residents restricted from traveling to other cities or barangays.
Barangay governments can issue quarantine passes allowing residents to buy essential goods outside curfew hours and within the issuing barangays' jurisdiction.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act which was effective in 2020 also provides measures related to the ECQ, such as:
Limitations on an all forms of transportation
Work suspensions and the setting up of alternative working arrangements such as teleworking
Ensuring the supply of food and medical products
Measures against profiteering and hoarding of essential goods
Provision allowing a 30-day grace period for loan and rental payments during the quarantine period
Cancellation of mass gatherings
Closure of non-essential businesses

People aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant women are barred from going out their homes except to either obtain essential goods and services or to report for work.

Mass gatherings (more than 10 persons
outside and non-household members indoors) and face-to-face classes are not allowed in ECQ zones.
Religious gatherings and dine-in services are not allowed.
Shopping malls are allowed to operate for essential services.

Limitations on mass transportation.

In addition to front-line services (health and other emergency services); full operations is allowed for certain operations including agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and delivery and courier services of essential goods.

Limited operations for certain sectors.
Unlike in 2020, ECQ measures as of 2021 had more lenient restrictions on transportation allowing for operations of public transportation at a limited capacity.
However, with the ECQ period in March-April 2021 coinciding with the Holy Week and late release of guidelines of the Department of Transportation, this resulted in the virtual absence of public transportation in some areas.

===
General community quarantine (GCQ) ===
The general community quarantine (GCQ), which was introduced on May 1, is generally less stringent than ECQ.
Public transportation is allowed at a reduced capacity and select businesses are allowed to operate at 50 to 100 percent of their regular capacity depending on their industry.
Shopping malls are also allowed to operate, although only select stalls and stores are allowed to open.
A level under GCQ, is called a modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).Sporting activities has been allowed in areas under GCQ since July 2020, although live spectators are not allowed for sports events.

===
Other measures ===
There are types of quarantine or lockdown measures aside from the ECQ and GCQ.
Additional measures have been imposed under an "extensive enhanced community quarantine" or "extreme enhanced community quarantine" (EECQ).
An EECQ is generally stricter than an ECQ.
Prior to the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon, a more lenient measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a curfew, was imposed in Metro Manila and was officially called a "community quarantine".
Several LGUs has used the term "hard lockdown," which is an area under disease monitoring and mass testing for the virus.
In May 2020, additional terms were coined by the government to categorize the community quarantine according to its risk assessment and those new terms are "modified enhanced community quarantine," "modified general community quarantine" and "new normal.
"A "total lockdown" measure, distinct from an ECQ, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving their places of residence and mandate the closure of all public establishments.
According to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, this measure is considered as an option.
A "special concern lockdown" can be applied to only a portion of a barangay with a high concentration or clustering of active cases of COVID-19.
It can be a road, a compound, or a block.

A classification of measures called "new normal", a level under MGCQ, was introduced sometime in June 2020, but has not yet been used.
An area needs to be placed under MGCQ prior to the imposition of new normal measures.

The COVID-19 vaccination program in the Philippines is an ongoing immunization campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to Pfizer–BioNTech, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sputnik V, Janssen and Covaxin COVID-19 vaccines.
There are eight other vaccines on order for the program, at varying stages of development.

As of April 27, 2021, about 1,809,801 total vaccine doses have been administered throughout the country.
1,562,815 individuals have been vaccinated across the country, with 246,986 receiving the second dose.
The mass vaccination program would begin by May 2021.

==
Background and timeline ==
The COVID-19 Immunization Program Management Organizational Structure was formed on October 26, 2020 to facilitate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines, however this was replaced by a vaccine cluster within the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) by November 6, 2020.
Carlito Galvez Jr. was appointed to lead the cluster under the title of vaccine czar.
The Philippine National Vaccination Program and Implementation Plan was also approved by November 6, 2020.
===
Preparation ===


====
Organizations involved ====
The COVID-19 Immunization Program Management Organizational Structure was formed on October 26 with the intention of it overseeing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once these became available.
However, by November 6, the vaccine body was abolished and replaced with a vaccine cluster within the National Task Force Against COVID-19 of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
The vaccine cluster is distinct from the national task force's COVID-19 response cluster.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on their part is the agency tasked to review and approve the use and commercial distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines as well as the issuance of an emergency use authorization for the same.

====
Delivery plan ====
The national government planned to rollout its vaccination program around February expecting the delivery of vaccines from Pfizer's vaccines sourced from the COVAX facility and the first batch of Sinovac's vaccines, consisting of 50,000 doses.
The delivery of Pfizer's vaccines was delayed due to documentary issues.
The government plans to start a full rollout or mass vaccination for the general populace around late 2021.

===
Regulatory approval ===
Under normal circumstances, drugs and vaccines are reviewed for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a period of six months.
President Rodrigo Duterte to fast-track the government's medical response to the pandemic signed an executive order on December 2, 2020 which allowed the FDA to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
An EUA for a particular vaccine would authorize the government to buy said vaccine and allow to use the same for the vaccination program.
An EUA would not authorize the commercial use of such vaccines or consent the use of the vaccine for personal use.
The EUA approval process by the FDA is covered under FDA Circular No.
2020-036.A
EUA granted for COVID-19 vaccine or drug
remains valid if it fulfills three conditions:
Based on the totality of evidence including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19.

The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine...outweigh the known and potential risks, if any.

There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the drug or vaccine.
The EUAs validity ends one year from the lifting of the public health emergency status
declared in response to the pandemic or one year from the date it was registered if a COVID-19 drug or vaccine gets fully registered with the FDA.Among
the conditions is for a vaccine manufacturer to secure a EUA in the Philippines is to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a "mature" regulator.
No manufacturer would be allowed to obtain a EUA in the Philippines first.
For the purpose of the FDA's EUA approval process, the following foreign regulators are considered as "mature":
Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia)
Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (Japan)
Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (South Korea)
Health Canada
Health Sciences Authority (Singapore)
Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Switzerland)
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (United Kingdom)
Food and Drug Administration (
United States)
European Medicines Agency (European Union)

By local governments =====
Local government units in the Philippines, from individual municipalities and cities and provinces has allocated part of their budgets to procure their own supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
Along with private companies, local governments had to procure vaccines through cooperation with the national government which led to some members of the Congress questioning urging the national government to allow local governments to procure vaccines unilaterally.
However, the government pointed out that only national governments could directly procure vaccines through the World Health Organization's COVAX facility and that third-party private firms and local governments had to sign a tripartite deal with the national government and member vaccine manufacturer.

Controversies ==


===
Vaccination of the Presidential Security Group ===


===
Black market ===
In January 2021, during the time when only the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine had an emergency use authorization, it was reported that an alleged black market of smuggled vaccines from China has established itself in the Philippines.
The demand for the vaccines is particularly high for Chinese nationals in the country, especially those employed by Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).
The doses are reportedly sold at inflated prices, considerably more expensive than the standard price of the same vaccines in China.
In late March 2021, the FDA released an advisory cautioning the public against fake vaccines and that vaccines which had emergency use authorization are not authorized to be sold commercially.
Although as of that date, there are no reports yet of fake vaccines proliferating in the country as per the FDA.

===
Line jumping ===
The DOH reported in March 2021 that a number of individuals had jumped the line to get the vaccine, becoming vaccinated despite being otherwise ineligible to do so.
These include several local government officials, prompting the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to issue show cause orders against them to explain why they were vaccinated, and actor Mark Anthony Fernandez, who was vaccinated despite not belonging to a priority group for the vaccine.
Fernandez, for his part, claimed that he had underlying health conditions that otherwise made him eligible.
The issue has raised the concerns of the Commission on Human Rights, and has also led to the WHO warning the Philippine government that it risks losing access to its share of vaccines provided by COVAX if the practice continues.
A number of suggestions were floated to address line jumping, with Senator Franklin Drilon urging the government to ramp up the country's vaccine supply, and Representative Precious Hipolito, who represents the second district of Quezon City, filing a bill that would amend the Philippines' COVID-19 vaccination law to criminalize the practice.

Timeline ==


=== January 2020 ===
On 13 January, the Ministry of Public Health announced the first confirmed case, a 61-year-old Chinese woman who is a resident of Wuhan.
She had not visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but was noted to have been to other markets.
She developed a sore throat, fever, chills and a headache on 5 January, flew directly with her family and a tour group from Wuhan to the Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on 8 January, where she was detected using thermal surveillance and then hospitalised.
Four days later she tested positive.
Thailand's second case occurred in a 74-year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Bangkok on a flight from Wuhan on 13 January.
On 21 January, Nakornping Hospital reported a suspected case of a 18-year-old male patient who arrived in Chiang Mai from Wuhan with a high fever; his blood samples were sent to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Bangkok for further analysis.
His condition had improved according to an official statement released by Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital on 31 January.
On 22 January, the MOPH announced two additional confirmed cases.
The third was a 68-year-old man, a Chinese tourist as in previous cases.
The fourth case was the first case for a Thai citizen; a 73-year-old woman hospitalised at Nakhon Pathom Hospital in Nakhon Pathom Province, arriving from Wuhan.
The fifth case was confirmed on 24 January involving a 33-year-old Chinese woman arriving from Wuhan with her 7-year-old daughter who was not infected.
She admitted herself to Rajvithi Hospital, arrival in Bangkok on 21 January.
On 25 January, the government of Hua Hin District in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province reported a case for a 73-year-old Chinese woman patient who had arrived from Wuhan since 19 January before entering a private hospital in Hua Hin on 23 January.
Initial blood sample analysis tested positive; however, authorities are awaiting results from another lab for confirmation.
On 26 January, the Thai Ministry of Public Health said eight cases were confirmed, including one from Hua Hin.
All were Chinese, except for a woman from Nakhon Pathom.
The first five patients were discharged.
Another six cases were confirmed on 28 January, with five from the same family in Wuhan and another from Chongqing.
Thailand began scanning all travellers from China.
On 31 January, an additional five cases were reported, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed cases to 19.
One was a local taxi driver who had no records of travelling to China and was thus suspected to have been infected by a Chinese tourist he picked up, making this the first case of human-to-human virus transmission within the country.
The taxi driver was reported to have come into contact with at least thirteen other individuals, mostly family members, before seeking treatment.
The other cases were Chinese nationals.

===
February 2020 ===
On 2 February, doctors from the Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok announced that they had seen the success in treating severe cases of COVID-19 using a combination of drugs for flu (oseltamivir) and HIV (lopinavir and ritonavir), with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours after applying the treatment.

However, it was still too soon to confirm that this approach can be applied to all cases.
On 4 February, the Thai government dispatched a Thai AirAsia plane to retrieve 138 citizens who were trapped in Wuhan following the lockdown, which landed at U-Tapao International Airport at 7:00 p.m. local time.
Among the evacuees, six were hospitalised with high temperatures, with the rest subsequently sent to be quarantined in Sattahip Naval Base for two weeks.
Three citizens were not evacuated, which included two students with high fever and another with an overstayed visa.
On the same day, Thailand confirmed another six cases, including a Thai couple who had just returned from Japan; it was unclear whether they had contracted the virus while travelling or after returning to Thailand.
Two new cases were also reported in drivers who had picked up Chinese passengers.
On 8 February, another six cases were confirmed involving two Chinese, and one passenger on board the evacuation flight from 4 days ago and two other Thais who had exposure to tourists.
These six cases brought the total count of confirmed cases to 32.On 11 February, another new case was confirmed, bringing the total count to 33.On
15 February, the 35th case was found in a 35-year-old Thai woman who worked in a private hospital, marking the first infection in a health worker.
An investigation found that she did not wear a mask and protective suit while treating a patient.
Several previous reports erroneously claimed that she worked for Bamrasnaradura Institute, which was later refuted and clarified by the MOPH.After 8 days with no reported cases, two more cases were confirmed on 24 February, bringing the number to 37.
Two days later, the number of confirmed cases went up to 40, two of which were Thai nationals who had recently been to Japan.
The elderly couple, who had just returned from Hokkaido, had already spread their virus to their 8-year-old grandson at home before seeking treatment.
101 high-risk individuals whom they came into contact with were tested for the virus, including fellow tour group members, family members, passengers on their returning flight, medical workers and the grandson's classmates; 97 tested negative while 4 are still awaiting confirmation.
The grandfather was criticised by Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul for initially refusing to disclose his travel history when interrogated by doctors, as he was at risk of becoming a super-spreader.
On 29 February, a new case was confirmed, bringing the total count to 42.
A 21-year-old salesman whose job brought him exposures to foreign travellers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

In mid-December, the government announced that they were considering whether to reduce the mandatory quarantine for arrival from 14 to 10 days, in an effort to attract foreign tourists.
Days later, an outbreak occurred in Samut Sakon, just southwest of Bangkok, increasing the country's total confirmed cases by at least 20%.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia is part of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus spread to Slovenia on 4 March 2020, when the first case was confirmed.
It was an imported case transmitted by a tourist traveling from Morocco via Italy, which was the center of the SARS-CoV-2 in Europe at the time.
The first few days of the pandemic were challenging for Slovenia due to the resignation of Prime Minister Marjan Šarec in late January and the formation of a new government.
The first case in Slovenia was confirmed one day after Janez Janša was elected Prime Minister.
During the transition period, the outbreak escalated.
A joint meeting between the outgoing and incoming governments was held on 10 March 2020.
Marjan Šarec's outgoing caretaker government was responsible for the crisis management until 14 March 2020.
On 15 May 2020, Slovenia became the first European nation to declare the end of the COVID-19 epidemic within its territory.
Slovenia's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak was cited as a significant success when Europe faced the first wave of the pandemic, and earned praise for its effectiveness.
In May 2020, Vox listed Slovenia, together with Jordan, Greece, Iceland and Vietnam as among the most effective in handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
However, the government neglected second wave warnings from experts and did not properly prepare the health care sector to cope with the second wave, which spread out of control for the administration, even after more than three months of lockdown, and as of March 2021, Slovenia had the fourth highest death rate per capita in the world (according to data compiled by John Hopkins University).

As of 28 April 2021, 413,033 people in Slovenia have been vaccinated (around 19.7% of the population).
==
Background ==

Template:COVID-19 pandemic
Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus  which is a member of the species Alphacoronavirus 1.
It causes a highly contagious intestinal disease worldwide in dogs.
The infecting virus enters its host cell by binding to the APN receptor.
It was discovered in 1971 in Germany during an outbreak in sentry dogs.
The virus is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus and subgenus Tegacovirus.

==
Canine enteric coronavirus ==


===
Pathology ===
The virus invades and replicates in the villi of the small intestine.

Intestinal disease may be related to virus-induced apoptosis (programmed cell death) of cells of the epithelial mucosa of the small intestine.

Canine coronavirus was originally thought to cause serious gastrointestinal disease, but now most cases are considered to be very mild or without symptoms.

A more serious complication of canine coronavirus occurs when the dog is also infected with canine parvovirus.

Coronavirus infection of the intestinal villi makes the cells more susceptible to parvovirus infection.

This causes a much more severe disease than either virus can separately.

However, fatal intestinal disease associated with canine coronavirus without the presence of canine parvovirus is still occasionally reported.

This may be related to the high mutation rate of RNA positive stranded viruses, of which canine coronavirus is one.
===
Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and control ===
The incubation period is one to three days.

The disease is highly contagious and is spread through the feces of infected dogs, who usually shed the virus for six to nine days, but sometimes for six months following infection.

Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia.

Diagnosis is through detection of virus particles in the feces.

Treatment usually only requires medication for diarrhea, but more severely affected dogs may require intravenous fluids for dehydration.

Fatalities are rare.

The virus is destroyed by most available disinfectants.

There is a vaccine available
(ATCvet code: QI07AD11 (WHO)),
and it is usually given to puppies, who are more susceptible to canine coronavirus, and to dogs that have a high risk of exposure, such as show dogs.

== Canine respiratory coronavirus ==
Recently, a second type of canine coronavirus (Group II) has been shown to cause respiratory disease in dogs.

Known as canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and found to be similar to strain OC43 of bovine and human coronaviruses, it was first isolated in the United Kingdom in 2003 from lung samples of dogs and has since been found on the European mainland and in Japan.

A serological study in 2006 has also shown antibodies to CRCoV to be present in dogs in Canada and the United States.

However, a retrospective study in Saskatchewan found that CRCoV may have been present there as far back as 1996.

See How COVID-19 Has Spread
The COVID-19 pandemic in Italy is part of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus.
One week later an Italian man repatriated back to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalised and confirmed as the third case in Italy.
Clusters of cases were later detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February, with the first deaths on 22 February.
By the beginning of March, the virus had spread to all regions of Italy.
On 31 January, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency.
In February, eleven municipalities in northern Italy were identified as the centres of the two main Italian clusters and placed under quarantine.
The majority of positive cases in other regions traced back to these two clusters.

On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, and on the following day to all of Italy, placing more than 60 million people in lockdown.
On 11 March 2020, Conte prohibited nearly all commercial activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies.
On 21 March, the Italian government closed all non-essential businesses and industries, and restricted movement of people.
In May, many restrictions were gradually eased, and on 3 June freedom of movement across regions and other European countries was restored.
In October, Italy was hit by the second wave of the pandemic, which brought the government to introduce further restrictions on movement and social life, which, as of March 2021, are still in effect.
As of 24 April 2021, Italy has 461,448 active cases, one of the highest in the world.
Overall, there have been 3,949,517 confirmed cases and 119,021 deaths (a rate of 1,973  deaths per million population) while there have been 3,369,048 recoveries or dismissals.
By 24 April, Italy had tested about 25,115,000 people.
Due to the limited number of tests performed, the real number of infected people in Italy, as in other countries, is estimated to be higher than the official count.
In May 2020, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) estimated 11,000 more deaths for COVID-19 in Italy than the confirmed ones.
This estimation was later confirmed in October 2020 by a second Istat report.
In March 2021, Istat published a new report in which it detected an excess mortality of 108,000 deaths in 2020, compared to the average of the previous five years.
Moreover, 2020 became the year with the highest amount of deaths since 1945, when Italy was fighting in World War II on its soil.

==
Background ==
On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Wuhan, Hubei, China, informed the WHO about a cluster of acute pneumonia cases with unknown origin in its province.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) reported the identification of a novel coronavirus (later identified as the SARS-CoV-2) as the cause.
In late January 2020, following the developments of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China, on 3 February, Italy set up enhanced screening measures, including thermal cameras and medical staff at airports.

Nationwide measures ===
On 1 March, the Council of Ministers approved a decree to organise the containment of the outbreak.
In the decree, the Italian national territory was divided into three areas:

A red zone (composed of the municipalities of Bertonico, Casalpusterlengo, Castelgerundo, Castiglione D'Adda, Codogno, Fombio, Maleo, San Fiorano, Somaglia and Terranova dei Passerini in Lombardy, and the municipality of Vo' in Veneto), where the whole population is in quarantine.

A yellow zone (composed of the regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna), where social and sports events are suspended and schools, theatres, clubs, and cinemas are closed.

The rest of the national territory, where safety and prevention measures are advertised in public places and special sanitisations are performed on means of public transport.
On 4 March, the Italian government imposed the shutdown of all schools and universities nationwide for two weeks as the country reached 100 deaths from the outbreak.
The same day, the government ruled that all sporting events in Italy would be played behind closed doors until 3 April.
On 5 March, when the newly appointed Emilia-Romagna regional minister of health, Raffale Donini, tested positive for COVID-19, Governor Stefano Bonaccini appointed Sergio Venturi as commissioner for the emergency.
Venturi was the regional minister of health until February 2020.

In the night between 7 and 8 March, the government approved a decree to lock down Lombardy and 14 other provinces in Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Marche, involving more than 16  million people.
The decree "absolutely avoided any movement into and out of the areas" and, like the previous one, it provided sanctions of up to three months in prison for those who violated the lockdown.
It was possible to move into and out of the areas only for emergencies or "proven working needs", which must be authorised by the prefect.
The decree also established the closure of all gyms, swimming pools, spas and wellness centres.
Shopping centres had to be closed on weekends, while other commercial activities could remain open if a distance of one metre between customers could be guaranteed.
The decree imposed the closure of museums, cultural centres and ski resorts in the lockdown areas and the closure of cinemas, theatres, pubs, dance schools, game rooms, betting rooms and bingo halls, discos and similar places in the entire country.
Civil and religious ceremonies, including funeral ceremonies, were suspended.
All organised events were also suspended, as well as events in public or private places, including those of a cultural, recreational, sporting and religious nature, even if held in closed places.
This measure was described as the largest lockdown in the history of Europe, as well as the most aggressive response taken in any region beyond China, and paralysed the wealthiest parts of the country as Italy attempted to constrain the rapid spread of the disease.
Riots broke out in many penitentiaries throughout Italy after restrictions on conjugal visits were imposed by the government in the 8 March decree.
Nine prisoners died in Modena and three in Rieti, while 76 detainees escaped from Foggia's penitentiary.
Two prison agents were assaulted and kidnapped in Pavia.
On 9 March in Bologna, detainees took control of the Dozza penitentiary, forcing personnel to exit the building.
On 11 March, two prisoners were found dead in Bologna's penitentiary.
In total, fourteen prisoners died in the whole country.
On 9 March, the government announced that all sporting events in Italy would be cancelled until at least 3 April, but the ban did not include Italian clubs or national teams participating in international competitions.
In the evening, Conte announced in a press conference that all measures previously applied only in the so-called "red zones" had been extended to the whole country, putting approximately 60 million people in lockdown.
Conte later proceeded to officially sign the new executive decree.

On 11 March, the government allocated 25 billion euros for the emergency.
In the evening, Conte announced a tightening of the lockdown, with all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, like grocery shops and pharmacies, closed down.
He also appointed Domenico Arcuri as Delegated Commissioner for the Emergency.
Arcuri will cooperate with Commissioner Angelo Borrelli with the aim of strengthening the distribution of intensive care equipment.
On 19 March, the Army was deployed to the city of Bergamo, the worst hit Italian city by COVID-19, as the local authorities can no longer process the number of dead residents.
The city's mayor Giorgio Gori said the true number of dead could be much higher than reported.
Army trucks transported bodies to crematoriums in several other cities, as cemeteries in the city were full.
On the following day, the Army was called in to assist the police forces in enforcing the lockdown.
On 20 March, the Ministry of Health ordered tighter regulations on free movement.
The new measures banned open-air sports and running, except individually and in close proximity of one's residence.
Parks, playgrounds, and public green were closed down.
Furthermore, movement across the country was further restricted, by banning "any movement towards a residence different from the main one", including holiday homes, during weekends and holidays.
On 21 March, Conte announced further restrictions within the nationwide lockdown, by halting all non-essential production, industries and businesses in Italy, following the rise in the number of new cases and deaths in the previous days.
This measure had also been strongly asked for by multiple institutions, including trade unions, mayors, and regional presidents, as well as medical professionals, but was initially opposed by the industrialists.
On 24 March, in a live-streamed press conference, Conte announced a new decree approved by the Council of Ministers.
The decree imposed higher fines for the violation of the restrictive measures, and regulation of the relationship between government and Parliament during the emergency.
It included also the possibility of reducing or suspending public and private transport, and gave the regional governments power to impose additional restrictive regulations in their regions for a maximum of seven days before being confirmed by national decree.
On 1 April, the government extended the period of lockdown until 13 April, with health minister Speranza saying that the restrictive measures had begun to yield the first positive results.

On 6 April, the government announced a new economic stimulus plan, consisting of €200 billion of state-guaranteed loans to companies and additional €200 billion of guarantees to support exports.
On 7 April, after more than a month of suspension, the Italian Basketball Federation officially ended the 2019–20 LBA season, without assigning the title.
On 8 April, a government's decree closed all Italian ports until 31 July, stating that they do not ensure the necessary requirements for the classification and definition of "safe place", established by the Hamburg Rules on maritime search and rescue.
"On
10 April, Conte announced the prolongation of the lockdown until 3 May, as well as the reopening of some businesses like bookshops and forestry.
On 26 April, the Prime Minister announced a starter plan for the so-called "phase 2", that would start from 4
May. Movements across regions would still be forbidden, while the ones between municipalities would be allowed only for work and health reasons, as well as for visits to relatives.
The plan allowed the re-opening of manufacturing industries and construction sites, however schools, bars, restaurants and hairdressers would stay closed.
On 13 May, Education Minister Lucia Azzolina announced schools would remain closed until September.
On 16 May, Conte announced the government plan for the easing of restrictions.
Starting from 18
May most businesses could reopen, and free movement was granted to all citizens within their region; movement across regions was still banned for non-essential motives.
Furthermore, on 25 May swimming pools and gyms could also reopen, and on 15 June theatres and cinemas.
On 3 June, free movement within the whole national territory was restored, de facto ending the lockdown started in March.
Penalties for breaching isolation were increased with fines from €500 to €5,000 and imprisonment of up to 18 months.

===
Containment measures on the second wave ===
Starting from July 2020, many countries in Europe, including Italy, witnessed a new rise in detected COVID-19 cases.
On 7 October, the Parliament postponed the end of the state of emergency to 31 January 2021, and Prime Minister Conte imposed the use of protection mask outdoors.

On 13 October 2020, the Italian government reintroduced stricter rules to limit the spread of COVID-19.
Demonstrations and gatherings of people were strictly forbidden.
Regions and municipalities were given the power to only tighten, but not release, containment measures.
Italian regions and the central government began reinforcing hospitals to accommodate more sick and infected with COVID-19.

All hospital facilities were upgraded and expanded with a larger capacity for beds and intensive units than in March 2020.

The Italian government also purchased about 19 million doses of flu vaccine, to be distributed to the population.

Tracking applications, monitoring systems with the help of surveillance drones and predictive systems are used to understand the progress of the epidemic.

If containment fails, the possible cases of infections will rise to about one million people and about 80,000 will died before the end of the pandemic, but the release of the COVID-19 vaccine is imminent and can change this dramatic projection.
On 25 October, Conte introduced new restrictions, imposing the closing of gyms, swimming pools, theatres and cinemas, as well as the closing of bars and restaurants by 6pm.
===
Variants of the virus and third wave ===
Predictive systems have proven reliable and confirmed the increase in cases and deaths since October 2020.
The start of the vaccination campaign on 27 December 2020 did not limit the spread of the virus in the population that is still vulnerable, but safeguarded doctors and health professionals and partly the elderly and immuno-depressed patients.

However, the appearance of numerous variants of the more lethal virus such as the English one, and those still to be assessed as dangerous such as the South African and Brazilian or Amazonian ones together with a slowdown in the vaccination campaign due to a poor supply of vaccines will lead to a worsening of the prospects for containing the virus.
and an increase of another 40,000 deaths by spring 2021.
===
Local measures ===
On 15 March, President of Campania Vincenzo De Luca imposed a strict quarantine on Ariano Irpino, in the province of Avellino, and four other municipalities in the province of Salerno, Atena Lucana, Caggiano, Polla, and Sala Consilina.
On 16 March, President of Emilia-Romagna Stefano Bonaccini imposed a strengthened quarantine on the municipality of Medicina, near Bologna, since it had developed an intense outbreak.
People were not allowed to enter or exit the town for any reason.
In early April, Lombardy and Tuscany made it compulsory for all residents to wear a face mask when leaving their home.
Due to the spike in COVID-19 cases in August, Italy's health minister, Roberto Speranza announced the closure of nightclubs in some parts of the country and made masks mandatory between 6 pm and 6 am, in crowded areas and at social gatherings.
The restrictions came into effect from 17 August 2020.On 15 October 2020, the president of Campania De Luca, closed all schools and universities until 30 October 2020.
On 23 October, De Luca announced a regional lockdown, imposing restrictions to all not essential movements as well as a curfew.
In the night, riots and clashes happened in the streets of Naples to protest against the lockdown.

===
Screening and testing policies ===
The strategy of mass-testing asymptomatic carriers was proven to be successful in stopping the spread of the virus in one Italian town.
This strategy in Italy was supported by the region of Veneto.

===
Vaccination campaign ===
The vaccination campaign began on 27 December 2020, when Italy received 9,750 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine.
These doses were entirely used in the following days to vaccinate part of the medical and health personnel of hospitals.
As a member of the EU, Italy would receive vaccine doses together with the other EU countries in a coordinated task managed by the European Commission.
The first Italian region to start with vaccinations was Lazio, in the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome.
On 6 January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave the green light to the Moderna vaccine.
As of 14 January 2020, a total of 972,099 vaccines were administered in Italy.

==
Lockdown areas ==
On 22 February, the government established a lockdown for eleven municipalities in Lombardy and Veneto.

On 7 March, the government prepared to extend until 3 April the restricted zone to all of Lombardy, plus fourteen other provinces in Veneto (3), Emilia-Romagna (5), Marche (1) and Piedmont (5).
The lockdown affects over 16 million people, roughly a quarter of Italy's total population, and prevents people from entering or leaving the zone, except "for proven occupational needs or situations of need or for health reasons", under threat of fines.
The enclave nation of San Marino, which is nestled between two of the provinces, has been effectively locked down as well.

On 9 March, Prime Minister Conte announced that the lockdown would be extended to the entire country.

==
Impact ==


===
Healthcare ===
The pandemic outbreak heightened the pressure on the Italian healthcare system.
On 9 March, Alessia Bonari, a nurse from Grosseto who worked at a hospital in Milan, posted on Instagram stating that she was physically strained from being overworked and was scared to work after treating over 10,000 patients who have tested positive.
Bonari and her co-workers had been extremely exhausted due to the pressures of work, and according to her, health caretakers had been working in uncomfortable conditions.
The post, which reached global notoriety, contained a photo of her bruised face from wearing unfit masks and hazmat goggles, and stated that "the protective devices are bad."
She concluded her post persuading others "to be selfless, to stay at home and thus protect those who are most fragile."

On 17 March, undersecretary at the Ministry of Health Sandra Zampa announced the purchase of many new ventilators as well as the importing of one and a half million masks from South Africa.
In order to deal with the numbers of COVID-19 patients, intensive care units were expanded, and new hospitals were created, especially in Lombardy.
In Emilia-Romagna, professor Marco Ranieri developed a method to double the efficiency of ventilators in ICUs.
The lack of a single protocol for hospitals was considered to be a problem.
Due to hospitals overcrowding with coronavirus patients, thousands of cancer patients experienced difficulties in getting access to treatment and transplants, with their lives put at even higher risk.
Dozens of cancer hospital sections were indeed either dedicated to host coronavirus wards, or closed after personnel got infected.
According to a study, cancer patients represented 17% of coronavirus fatalities in Italy.
In March 2020, oncologist Luigi Cavanna of the hospital of Piacenza was one of the first physicians in Italy to focus on house calls, realizing that too many critically-ill
COVID-19 patients were arriving at his hospitals and that some of them could have been treated earlier at home before a possible escalation of the symptoms.
A letter published on the NEJM Catalyst Innovations in Care Delivery claimed that one of the reasons for the high death count in the area of Bergamo was hospital contamination.
Progressively, different hospitals became dedicated to COVID-19 patients only, and more rigid separations were set up between hospital sections and triage structures.
In some regions, hotels were used to host healthcare workers or patients, and in Liguria a ship was adapted to host people in quarantine.
On 1 April, the first Italian drive-through testing facilities opened in Alessandria and in north-western Tuscany.
At least ten different clinical trials were ongoing in Italian hospitals at the beginning of April.
The supercomputer of ENEA in Portici was used to run advanced simulations related to other possible drugs.
Some of the treatments employed for COVID-19 patients involved the administration of antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir was tested with promising initial results in Naples.
Despite doubts from the scientific community, Avigan (favipiravir) was also included in testing protocols by Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) even though it was not authorised in Europe.
Similarly to France, hydroxychloroquine (the less toxic version of the malaria drug chloroquine)
was also tested:
in Lazio, its use was reported by the second week of April on a significant fraction of the roughly a thousand COVID-19 patients confined at home.
Later prohibited by AIFA, the use of hydroxychloroquine was approved again in December by the Council of State upon request of some general practitioners.
Plasma treatment already tried in China (transfer of antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients to sick people) was tested at the hospital of Pavia (and later in Mantua) under the supervision of professor Cesare Perotti; the first two donors involved in the research programme were a married couple, both doctors and among the first COVID-19 patients reported in the province.
The final results published in May showed a reduction in mortality.
In the beginning of April, based on the results of autopsies showing the presence of micro-thrombosis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, doctors in Tuscany and other areas of northern Italy started to use heparin to reduce the risk of blood clotting; the news was originally circulating on social media from internal chats of healthcare workers and considered a hoax by virologist Roberto Burioni, but protocols including low-molecular-weight heparin were formally submitted as a treatment proposal to AIFA.
A programme involving 14 research centres was approved on 13 April.

The workforce of the healthcare system underwent massive reorganisation.
Pediatricians were assigned to adult patients and as a result, their insurance coverage had to be adapted.
Retired professionals were asked to go back to work to fill the vacancies, despite the high risk for their age group.
At the peak of the pandemics volunteers from the rest of the country were sent to hospitals in critical areas of northern and central Italy.
Healthcare workers were also affected by coronavirus infections, with a higher percentage of the infected healthcare workers being women because of their predominance among nurses.
This resulted in death in a considerable number of cases, especially amongst general practitioners.
By the end of March, more than 60 doctors in Italy had died with COVID-19, and the figure increased to 80 by 4 April and later 145 by 22 April.
Healthcare personnel were also subject to high levels of stress, and the risk of professional burn-out was considered high, particularly across nurses and in more affected areas.
Two suicides, one of a nurse in Jesolo and one of a nurse in Monza, were assumed to be related to psychological pressure.
The emergency was an occasion to test or develop new protocols based on digital technologies.
With the aim of reducing consumption of protective equipment, robots were introduced in hospitals in Varese, and remote diagnostics were introduced to monitor home care patients in Lodi.
To facilitate home calls from patients, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genoa (IIT) and Istituto di robotica e macchine intelligenti (I-RIM) designed a robot for video calls that could be assembled by hospital personnel and that was tested at the end of April in Pisa, Massa-Carrara and Induno Olona.
The Policlinico Universitario in Rome tested AI software for fast analysis of chest X-rays.

===
Economy ===
The pandemic provoked large economic damage to the Italian economy.
The sectors of tourism, accommodation and food services were among the hardest hit by foreign countries' limitations to travel to Italy, and by the nationwide lockdown imposed by the government on 8 March.
By April, finance minister Roberto Gualtieri predicted a 6% GDP decline for 2020.On 12 March, the Italian stock market was among the worst hit during Black Thursday, when the FTSE MIB index lost 17% of its value in one day.
Multiple factories, like Fiat Chrysler, halted production in some of their plants.
On 21 March, the government issued the shutdown of all non-essential businesses, industries, and economic activities.
The Economist predicts a 7% GDP decline for Italy in 2020.
Economist Alberto Bisin forecast that Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from 130% to 180% by the end of the year, due to borrowing and losses.
Multiple economists believe that Italy will struggle to pay back its debt.
Although the virus has hit northern Italy hardest, economically deprived areas of southern Italy are suffering the most from the lockdown.
Many residents of those areas work in the grey economy and are therefore not eligible for unemployment benefits.
In some places the Italian mafia was reported to be delivering groceries to needy residents.
Prosecutors warned that the mafia was not acting out of altruism and was instead seeking control over residents.

====
Conversion of production to medical supplies ====
Some Italian small and medium-sized enterprises partially or totally converted their production to supply personal protective equipment at a local scale.
Many of these items could not be approved for hospital use, but they were considered useful to supply demand for the general population.

In Veneto, Grafica Veneta – the printing company of the Harry Potter books in Italian – started to mass-produce protective masks.

In Piedmont, Ci.
Ti.
Elle, a company from Castiglione Torinese specialising in textiles for hotels, put its twelve employers to assembling surgical masks for the regional Protezione Civile, and the hospitals of San Maurizio Canavese, Alessandria and Chivasso, with the support the Filmar company from Caselle for the elastics.

In Lombardy Cifra, a manufacturer from Verano Brianza specialising in sportswear, also converted its production line.

In the textile district of the province of Prato, the Machattie company started production of polypropylene masks in March, and the Dreoni company in Vaiano switched its production from car upholstery to protective masks with certified standard, with the help of the local population
(its owner later died of COVID-19).Companies producing alcoholic beverages
also underwent reconversion to produce alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
In Piedmont this occurred in Canelli at the Ramazzotti factory (part of the Pernod Ricard group) and in Chieri at the Martini plant.
Isinnova, a local engineering startup from Brescia, provided emergency solutions to local hospitals to compensate the shortages of spare parts for the machines.
Firstly, they produced venturi valves for respirators using 3D printers, and later (in collaboration with Decathlon)
they adapted a snorkelling mask into a non-invasive ventilator.
Using 3D-printer technology as well, Elmec Informatica started to produce for the hospital of Busto Arsizio, sterilisable protective masks in thermoplastic polyurethanes that could adapt to Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) antiviral filters.
The Italian National Mint and Printing House used the plastic film applied to identity cards to produce face shields.

====
Cross-talks with the EU ====
On 25 March, Italy, together with Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain, sent a joint letter to the Council of the EU, calling for the issuing of a new common debt instrument, nicknamed in the media as "eurobond" or "corona bond", to help funding the measures taken against the coronavirus pandemic and the expected economic downturn to follow.
In subsequent conference calls between the leaders of the EU member states, the proposal saw the opposition of the Netherlands and Germany.
On 9 April, after two meetings of the Eurogroup, the ministers of Finances of the Eurozone countries agreed to €500 billion aid, including the possibility of using the ESM, but without common debt instruments.

===
Society ===
Subsequent to the imposing of the national lockdown, there were protests in some Italian prisons, with fourteen deaths among Modena, Bologna and Foggia's penitentiary.
With all of Italy ordered to remain indoors, Italians took to their balconies to sing together, play music, and applaud the country's health care providers.
Some of the demonstrations were spontaneous, others were organised by social media and radio.
On 13 March at 6 pm, Italians throughout the country joined to sing the national anthem.
At noon on 14 March, they stood on their balconies clapping to salute the nation's health care workers.
A video of opera singer Maurizio Marchini performing the aria "Nessun dorma" from his balcony in Florence went viral.
Some Italians have adapted the local custom of paying in advance at a cafe for a customer who can't afford it ("suspended coffee") by paying extra at grocery stores.
Shops may double the amount and donate non-perishable foods to local aid groups like the Community of Sant'Egidio.
Riots erupted on 23 October 2020 at night in Naples as people took to the street following the imposition of a curfew to reduce the spread of coronavirus.
This came after
Vincenzo De Luca, President of the Campania region, said that he was considering imposing a total lockdown, closing schools, businesses and leaving only essential services open, to prevent further spread of the virus.
They were the first such demonstrations in Italy since the start of its coronavirus outbreak eight months ago.
===
Education ===
After the first outbreak in Lombardy and Veneto, the regional governments of Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Trentino, and Veneto closed all schools and universities from 23 February to 1 March.
The suspension was later extended, with the agreement of the national government, up to 8 March in Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, and Veneto.
On 4 March, the government announced the closure of all schools and colleges until 15 March.
With the enactment of the lockdown of Lombardy and 14 more northern provinces on 8 March, the re-opening of schools in these areas was delayed to 3 April.
On 9 March, the government extended the lockdown to the national territory, closing all schools and universities until 3 April.
Schools eventually stayed closed until the end of the academic year.
Their safe reopening was organized by the Ministry of Education together with the Ministry of Health, and was scheduled on 14 September 2020.
However some regional governments opted for delaying the reopening.

===
Religion ===
In Italy, in-person gatherings for religious worship have been suspended and as a result, many churches broadcast Mass via online live-stream, radio and television.
Church funerals cannot be held given the national lockdown.
In some northern cities, authorities have had issues in dealing with the storage of the high number of coffins, and churches have offered to care for them.
In the towns of Seriate and Bergamo, the Italian Army has volunteered to transport some of these coffins from churches and morgues to cemeteries and crematoriums in other provinces.

===
Politics ===
On 5 March, the Italian government decided to postpone the constitutional referendum that was due on 29 March.
The referendum was delayed until September 2020.According to a few surveys, many Italians feel betrayed by the European Union's response to the crisis.
This has led to an increase in euroscepticism, with the number of Italians agreeing that EU membership is a disadvantage jumping from 47% in November 2018 to 67% in March 2020, according to a Tecnè survey.
Former president of the European Commission Donald Tusk said that the risk for the European Union is greater than the European debt crisis of 2009, and that despite the fact that EU aid to Italy is greater than from other countries, its perception is crucial.
Top Italian figures have condemned an article in a German newspaper suggesting the mafia was waiting for an influx of European Union cash amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said, “Die Welt, an important German newspaper, urged Europe this morning to not help Italy because ‘the mafia is waiting for money from Brussels’”.
===
Sport ===
On 13 October 2020, it was announced that Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo has tested positive for COVID-19.

Many Serie A football players have tested positive for the COVID-19 and some matches played in stadiums without a public have been postponed.
Even at the Giro d'italia 2020 some cyclists were found to be positive at COVID-19 and some withdrew from the race.
On 15 October 2020, motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi confirmed that he was positive for COVID-19.

On the same day, swimmer Federica Pellegrini confirmed that she was positive at COVID-19.
===
Wildlife ===
During the lockdown, wildlife was detected in many urban areas of Italy: roe deer were seen in urban centers in Piedmont, eagles in Milan, and brown bears in Trentino.
Fewer frogs and toads were killed on the roads due to the lower car traffic; birds such as the common swift and the Kentish plover had more favorable conditions to reproduce, and some invasive species such as the American cottontail rabbit also propagated more rapidly.
In the province of Mantua, damages to crops by wild animals increased drastically in 2020.

Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases – Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.
This article presents official statistics gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore.

The Ministry of Health of Singapore has been official numbers, on a daily basis since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 virus on 23 January 2020.
In their situation reports, the cases are broken down into several categories: imported cases, non-imported community cases, non-imported dormitory cases.
Prior to 16 April 2020, MOH had released the data only at the end of the day.
However upon discovery of a civil servant leaking information before the official release of data, since 17 April 2020, MOH has been providing a preliminary update of summarised figures at around noon of each day with the details released at the end of the day.

==
Classifying COVID-19 cases ==
Singapore follows strictly to World Health Organization's case definition for classifying COVID-19 deaths, which does not include non-pneumonia fatalities like those caused by blood or heart issues among COVID-19 patients in its official tally.
This was exemplified in three cases which the cause of death was recorded as either ischaemic heart disease or heart attack, and a suicide committed by an Indian migrant worker who was tested positive for the virus.

==
Untraced cases prior to 11 April 2020 ==


==
Charts ==
The linear plot shows the total number of cases as a function of time (by date) since 23 January 2020, the date of the first reported case in Singapore, while the graph plotted on a logarithmic scale, or a semi-log plot, shows an exponential growth in the number of cases as a straight line on the graph.
In the logarithmic scale plot, the slope of the straight line determines the rate of growth of the number of cases, with a steeper slope representing a higher growth rate.
The third and fourth plot shows the number of daily new cases and total active cases respectively as reported.

The linear plot shows the total number of tests performed as a function of time (by date) since 7 April 2020, the date of the first testing data given in Singapore.

On December 31, 2019 the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in China, reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
A novel coronavirus was eventually identified.

=
January 1, 2020
the WHO set up the IMST
(Incident Management Support Team) across all three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level,
putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.
On January 7, 2020, when it appeared that there was a health crisis emerging in Wuhan, Dr. Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, was quoted advising Canadians: "There has been no evidence to date that this illness, whatever it's caused by, is spread easily from person to person; no health care workers caring for the patients have become ill; a positive sign.

January 13
a person in Thailand is the first patient outside of China is confirmed to have COVID.On January 17, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) indicated plans were in progress "to implement signage" in the Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver airports to raise awareness of the virus, and that there would be an additional health screening question added to the electronic kiosks for passengers arriving from central China.
The agency noted the overall risk to Canadians was low and there were no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada.
The CBSA said it would not be, at that time, implementing extra screening measures, but would "monitor the situation
closely".
On January 23, the federal Minister of Health, Patty Hajdu, said that five or six people were being monitored for signs of the virus.
That same day, Dr. Theresa Tam was a member of the WHO committee that broadcast that it was too early to declare a public health emergency of international concern.
The following day in Wuhan China construction began on a new hospital to treat COVID patients that would take only 10 days to build and was widely reported around the world.
On January 25, the first identified presumptive case in Canada was a male in his 50s who travelled between Wuhan and Guangzhou before returning to Toronto on January 22.
Canada issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to China due to the outbreak, including a regional travel advisory to avoid all travel to the province of Hubei.
Federal health officials stated that the risk in Canada was low.
On January 26, Tam stated "There is no clear evidence that this virus is spread easily from person to person.
The risk to Canadians remains low."

Final testing conducted at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba confirmed the presumptive case on January 27.
On January 27, Canada confirmed its first case.
On January 29, Dr. Theresa Tam told Canadians that "It's going to be rare
(COVID-19),
but we are expecting cases.
"

On January 29, Minister of Foreign Affairs François-Philippe Champagne announced that an aircraft would be sent to repatriate Canadians from the areas affected by the virus in China.
On January 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus was a "public health emergency of international concern".

=== February ===
On February 1,  the government's position remained that it would be discriminatory to exclude travellers from China, the politico-geographical source of the disease.
On February 2, the Canadian Armed Forces announced that it planned to charter a plane to assist in the evacuation of Canadian nationals still in Wuhan once given authorization by China, intending to fly them to CFB Trenton for repatriation and medical screenings.
Only those that had entered the country with a Canadian passport would be allowed to take this flight.
The first plane landed at CFB Trenton on February 7.
On February 21, a chartered flight of 131 Canadians who were quarantined aboard Diamond Princess after an outbreak on the cruise ship in Japan, and who all tested negative for the virus, were brought to CFB Trenton for additional screening before being transported by bus to the NAV Centre in Cornwall, Ontario to be quarantined.
On February 10, University of Regina psychology professor Dr. Gordon J. G. Asmundson and University of British Columbia psychiatry professor Dr. Steven Taylor coined the neologism ‘coronaphobia’ to refer to fear of COVID-19 and its psychological impacts.
In an editorial, Asmundson and Taylor expanded on COVID-19-related mental health impacts by introducing the constructs of COVID Stress Syndrome and ‘COVID Stress Disorder’.
Per Asmundson and Taylor’s definition, COVID Stress Syndrome centers around fears about contamination and the dangerousness of COVID-19, and also involves fears of socioeconomic consequences, xenophobic attitudes, traumatic stress, and compulsive checking and reassurance seeking symptoms.
COVID Stress Disorder involves high levels of COVID Stress symptoms and severe functional impairment resulting from these symptoms.
COVID Stress Disorder is proposed by Asmundson and Taylor as a distinct diagnostic category as COVID Stress symptoms and the associated impairment cannot be accounted for by existing mental disorder diagnoses.

On February 26, Minister of Health Patty Hajdu recommended that citizens stockpile food and medication, noting that it was "good to be prepared because things can change quickly [in any emergency].
"
The recommendation faced criticism from provincial politicians:
Manitoba health minister Cameron Friesen and
Ontario health minister Christine Elliott both felt that there was no need for such aggressive stockpiling, while Friesen also felt that there needed to be more coordination between the federal and provincial levels in terms of information regarding the outbreak.
Conservative Party shadow minister Matt Jeneroux opined that the suggestion incited concern and was lacking in transparency.
Health Canada's website recommended against such bulk purchases (as to not strain supply chains), and explained that having supplies on hand was to "ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak
or if you become ill."

"On
March 24, 2020, a small number of MPs from each party met in the House of Commons to vote on an $82-billion emergency spending legislation, known as Bill C-13.

On April 7, Trudeau brought up the topic of masks, where he said, "If people want to wear a mask, that is okay.
It protects others more than it protects you, because it prevents you from breathing or... or... speaking, uh... 'moistly' on them."
He immediately regrets his word choice and says, "Ugh, what a terrible image.
"
The unusual word choice has led the creation of a remix song, "Speaking Moistly", based on the speech.
On April 9, the federal government released modelling that, even with strong public health measures, showed between 11,000 and 22,000 deaths over the course of the pandemic, with that number being closer to 300,000 deaths if no measures had been taken.
Trudeau warned that "normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine for this", and that residents would "have to remain vigilant for at least a year.
"
The same day, Trudeau sent a letter to the provincial and territorial premiers to consult about invoking the Emergencies Act.
While consultation with the provinces is a required step before the Act can be triggered, the Prime Minister's Office said there was no present plan to enact it and that doing so remained a last resort.
On a conference call between Trudeau and the premiers later that day, the premiers communicated their unanimous opposition to invoking the Act.
On April 10, the RCMP disclosed it has been asked to enforce the Quarantine Act, 2005.

He drew analogies to the debt problem in the 1980s which led "to a 1995 austerity budget that saw 45,000 public service jobs slashed, the elimination of 73 federal agencies, a 21 percent reduction in foreign aid and the privatization of Canadian National Railways."
Wernick said that:
One of the consequences of all this work from home experience is that ministers will figure out it really doesn't matter where those public servants are, they can be brought together for work teams and projects...
The federal service, it will be smaller, it will be less concentrated in Ottawa.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19):
Outbreak update Health Canada
COVIDmapper - Mapping
COVID-19 data from the past, present, and future
(daily updated projections)
The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed to have spread to Scotland on 1 March 2020 with the positive COVID-19 test of a male Tayside resident who had recently travelled between Scotland and northern Italy.
The first reported case of community transmission was on 11 March 2020 and the first reported coronavirus death in Scotland was on 13 March 2020.

The UK Government unveiled the Coronavirus Action Plan, and declared the outbreak a "level 4 incident".
On 11 March, the outbreak was declared a pandemic.
Four days later—following the outbreak in Italy, and based on forecasting by epidemiologists at Imperial College London—the Scottish Government said everyone should avoid all "non-essential" travel and contact with others, and to work from home if possible.
Those with symptoms, and their household, were asked to self-isolate.
Pregnant women, the over 70s, and those with certain illnesses were asked to self-isolate for longer.
On 20 March 2020, schools were told to close, along with pubs, cafes and cinemas.
On 23 March 2020, a 'Stay at Home'
order was announced which lead to more 'non-essential' work to close and limiting movement to stop the transmission of the virus; this would come to be referred to as the UK lockdown.
Health care in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, funded by devolved block grants via the Barnett formula and accountable to separate governments and parliaments, together with smaller private sector and voluntary provision.

As a result, a number of differences now exist between each system.
Virus transmission and case data is collected and reported in Scotland as well as the UK figures given out daily which reports the situation in all four nations.

By 27 April, more than 22,000 former staff and students had volunteered to join or rejoin the healthcare and social care services in Scotland since the epidemic began, signalling a significant re-organisation of health care services  By 9 May 2020
there had been 4,503 cumulative cases of suspected COVID-19 in care homes and up to 3,672 staff
had reported as absent in adult care homes due to COVID-19, representing 8.5% of all adult care home staff (43,403) for whom figures had been provided.
Since the start of the outbreak, Scotland has ramped testing from a capacity of less than 2000 tests a day to 8,000 per day by the middle of
May. Overall, by 11 May 2020 a total of 101,122 COVID-19 tests had been carried out by NHS Scotland labs in hospitals, care homes or the community.
In addition there were a total of 27,647 drive through and mobile tests carried out by Regional Testing Centres in Scotland.
By 20 May 2020, 14,969 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed and 2,245 test-confirmed deaths had been reported.
.
As of 10 February 2021, there had been 188,345 confirmed cases and 6,551 deaths test-related.
The vaccination programme totalled almost one million people having received the first dose.

9,831
COVID-19 deaths per death certificates were reported as of 14 March 2021.

This data is from published reports of the National Records of Scotland


==
Background ==
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.Unlike
the SARS outbreak of 2003
, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19  has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.
On 24 January, the first tests for COVID-19 came back negative, with the then Chief Medical Officer Dr. Catherine Calderwood saying that the risk was low for the Scottish public, although acknowledged that cases would arrive at some point.
The first case was detected on 1 March and by 23 March, the country went into lockdown.

5 October:
As a further 697 cases of the COVID-19 are reported, with 218 people as inpatients and 22 in intensive care, the First Minister of Scotland is set to meet advisers to discuss new measures, including the possibility of a two-week ″circuit breaker″ to stem the escalation of cases.

2 November:

Election matters are a reserved power, which only the UK Parliament holds, so this Bill would give this power to the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament.

19 November: Health Secretary Jeane Freeman gives a statement to the Scottish Parliament on vaccines.
She announces that Scotland is ready to administer the first vaccine for COVID-19 in the first week in February, if the vaccine is given safety clearance.

===
Public Health Scotland ===
On 1 April 2020, the Scottish Government launched the new Public Health Scotland (PHS) agency, as a result of a three-way merger between NHS Health Scotland and the Information Services Division (ISD) and Health Protection Scotland (HPS) sections of Public Health and Intelligence (PHI) (which was in itself a strategic business unit of NHS National Services Scotland (NSS)).
According to a 6 May 2020 report by the Press and Journal, PHS employs 1,100 staff and has a budget this year of £71 million, and it is jointly accountable to the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla).
=== 'Scotland Cares' campaign ===
A new 'Scotland Cares' campaign was launched on Monday 30 March to encourage people to volunteer during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
More than 21,000 people signed up on the first day.
By 4 April, the number of registrations to volunteer stood at 50,330.
Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People
Shirley-Anne Somerville said, "The response to the Scotland Cares campaign has been outstanding and I want to thank each and
every person who has signed up to volunteer during the coronavirus outbreak.
Your support at this critical time is invaluable and will make a huge difference over the coming weeks and months.
"
In addition, people who are healthy and not at risk can volunteer via the Ready Scotland website.

===
Vulnerable groups ===
Those in vulnerable groups were able from 3 April to register for deliveries of food and medicine.
This included around 120,000 people in Scotland who had been advised to shield at home (12 weeks of self-isolation), those with suppressed or compromised immune systems, and those with underlying health conditions.

The Scottish Government mailed out information about self-isolating if symptoms developed in a household member and about protective measures during the pandemic.

===
Levels System ===
From 23 October, the Scottish Government introduced a new 5-level System, similar to that in England.
Levels ranged from 0 to 4 (inclusive).
Social distancing measures applied in all levels, and some measures such as encouraging active transport, were present in all levels.

==
Testing and contact tracing ==


===
Testing capacity ===
NHS Scotland's testing capacity for COVID-19 increased from around 750 a day in early March to about 1,900 a day in early April.
By 15 March coronavirus testing was extended into Scotland's communities but there would be no routine testing of people with minor symptoms.
NHS Scotland plans to reach a testing capacity of around 3,500 a day by the end of April.
Glasgow University is to launch a major coronavirus testing facility in mid-April, staffed 24/7 by more than 500 volunteers including molecular scientists, technicians and bioinformaticians.

Aberdeen University has provided three machines to NHS Grampian to speed up coronavirus testing.
By 2 April 2020, around 3,500 tests have been conducted on NHS workers and family members in Scotland.
It was also reported in that week that around 6pc of Scotland's frontline NHS staff are not currently working, either because they have coronavirus symptoms or live with someone who has.
A coronavirus testing facility for NHS staff was opened at Glasgow Airport car park on 5 April.
Chief Medical Officer for Scotland Catherine Calderwood described mass testing as a distraction that will not slow down the spread of the virus.
She said: "I have been saying and advising the First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for several weeks now about the distraction that I think the focus on testing may become.
The testing is extremely useful but it is only going to be positive within a short window of perhaps 48 to 72 hours while somebody has symptoms, because there needs to be an amount of virus in that person to be able for that to be detected.
But the thought that the testing in some way slows the virus or is a part of our strategy to prevent transmission is a fallacy, I'm afraid.
The testing gives us more information but the social distancing and all of these stringent measures are what we actually need to prevent spread and prevent serious illnesses and death.
"Cam
Donaldson, a health economist and Pro Vice Chancellor Research, Glasgow Caledonian University has written of his scepticism of a "mass testing" strategy.
Derek Gatherer
a leading Scottish virologist has warned plans to test, trace and isolate everyone infected with the coronavirus after lockdown will not slow its spread.
Experts who have advocated a mass or large scale testing approach include Harry Burns former Scotland Chief Medical Officer(subscription required) and Allan Wilson President of the Institute of Biomedical ScienceProfessor Hugh Pennington
one of the leading bacteriologists said laboratory testing could have been easily scaled up ten-fold and criticised former chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood for dismissing testing as a 'distraction' that would not help to contain the virus.
Pennington believed a failure to increase testing to adequate levels will prove to be an enormous embarrassment to the UK and Scottish governments.
He said: "You test, so you can trace then take appropriate action, it's basic shoe leather epidemiology," adding he would not be surprised if the lack of testing had cost lives, particularly in care homes.
"
We know [care homes] are hotbeds of infection, vulnerable in annual flu outbreaks and that you have to look after them by stopping the virus getting in.
Much of that comes back to testing, tracing and isolating."

Former Scottish health secretary Alex Neil agreed, "the countries that have done this since day
one are those with the lowest death and infection rates and mass testing allows you to identify a second wave of infection if it appears.
"Professor of Immunology Denis Kinane said Scotland would need to conduct at least 15,000 tests a day to get on top of the disease.

Research carried out by scientific online publication Our World
In Data on COVID-19 test rates across EU member states ranked Scotland at 19 out of 25 countries that publish such data.
As of 11 May 2020, a total of 74,063 people in Scotland had been tested for COVID-19 in NHS labs.
Of these, 13,627 tests were confirmed positive, 60,436 tests were confirmed negative and 1,862 patients who tested positive have died.
A total of 101,122 COVID-19 tests had been carried out by NHS Scotland labs in hospitals, care homes or the community.
In addition there were a total of 27,647 drive through and mobile tests carried out by Regional Testing Centres in Scotland.

In November two further 'mega labs' were announced as due to open early in 2021, one of which was to be at 'an unconfirmed site in Scotland'.
The Scottish 'mega lab' has been subject to delays and in January its construction was halted.
The UK government was reported to be assessing "the long-term demand" for the laboratory.
Meanwhile, new regional coronavirus laboratories were opened in Glasgow and Aberdeen during December 2020, but another planned for Edinburgh has not yet opened.

===
Contact tracing system ===
Ciaran Jenkins of Channel
4 News contrasted the differing approaches on contact-tracing strategy between the Republic of Ireland and the health authorities in the UK including Scotland's.
Public health expert Prof Allyson Pollock has argued that a bespoke test-trace-isolate approach could work well in Scottish island communities.

Public healthcare infrastructure ==


===
Primary care network ===
Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said in a statement in the Scottish Parliament a network of COVID-19 local assessment centres was to be set up across Scotland with 50 planned in the first wave.

A network of "humanitarian assistance centres" is also to be set up, working with GPs and other local partners to arrange delivery of medicine, care services and grocery delivery.

===
Hospital capacity ===
Scotland has an estimated 3,000 hospital beds expected to be available for coronavirus patients in hospitals across Scotland.
ICU capacity across Scotland has doubled to 360 beds since the emergency began, 250 of which will be for the exclusive use of coronavirus patients, with that number expected to increase to more than 500 in the first week of April as preparations continue towards eventually quadrupling the number to more than 700 ICU beds.
The NHS Louisa Jordan emergency coronavirus hospital facility at the SEC Centre will initially have capacity for 300 patients, which could be expanded in the future to more than 1,000.Scottish hospitals plan to have around 1,000 ventilators by the summer for coronavirus patients.
By 1 April 2020, NHS clinical and technical staff have converted over 200 anaesthetic machines into ventilators to increase ICU bed availability to more than 500, tripling the usual capacity.
By 24 March more than 3,000 retired Scottish nurses, doctors and other medical workers have volunteered to return to work as part of efforts to help the NHS cope.
As well as using retired workers, all final year nursing and midwifery students will also be given paid work placements on wards during the final six months of their degree programmes.
On 30 March, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the suspension of several non-coronavirus screens (such as diabetic eye screening) to help free up NHS staff and reduce the risk of virus exposure to patients.
All elective and non-urgent surgeries had already been cancelled across Scotland to free up hospital beds.
On 27 April 121 junior doctors have started their careers early to support NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Scotland's largest health board in its coronavirus response.
A new post, foundation intermediate year, was created to allow them to start earlier instead of August
and they would be placed at Glasgow Royal Infirmary;
Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley; and Inverclyde Royal Hospital, Greenock.
As of 11 May 2020, 3,114 inpatients have been discharged from Scottish hospitals since 5 March 2020, who had been tested positive for COVID-19.
632 people are in delayed discharge in Scottish hospitals.
This is 980 less than the baseline period (04/03 weekly return).
A total of 6,227 staff (or around 3.8%) of the NHS Scotland workforce, are reporting as absent due to a range of COVID-19 related reasons.

=== Hospital-acquired infection ===
On the issue of hospital-acquired infections, Michael Griffin, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh warned coronavirus may be spreading in hospitals at twice the rate of its transmission in communities.

He said "we have to make our hospital environment as safe as possible.

In the general population, the rate of reproduction of COVID-19 is less than one
but in hospitals it is estimated at something like two."
===
A&E departments ===
The number of people attending Accident and Emergency departments in Scotland has fallen by more than 55% compared with 2019.
NHS Scotland statistics reveal 11,881 people attended A&E in the second week of April 2020, down from 26,674 patients in 2019 and 25,067 in 2018.

===
NHS staffing levels ===
As of 2 April, more than 14% of NHS Scotland staff were off work, according to Scottish government data and about 41% of those absences (equating to 9,719 people)
were related to coronavirus.
NHS Scotland's total workforce is about 166,000 people.
As of 11 May 2020, a total of 6,227 staff (or around 3.8%) of the NHS Scotland workforce, are reporting as absent due to a range of COVID-19 related reasons.

==
Personal protective equipment ==
On 2 April, new guidance on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare hospital, general practice, ambulance and social care workers responding to COVID-19 has been issued by officials.
On 26 April 2020, in response to a Sunday Times story that claimed the Scottish government failed to accept offers from six Scottish firms offering to supply PPE, a spokeswoman for the Scottish government said it had received 1,600 offers of help from Scottish businesses and individuals to supply or manufacture PPE and that a dedicated team and mailbox had been set up to focus on offers from local and global suppliers.
The spokeswoman added: "we understand that potential suppliers will desire prompt decisions but our priority focus is to quickly identify those offers that can supply the largest volumes at the correct quality specifications and timescales necessary to meet the requirements of frontline services".
Health secretary Jeane Freeman announced that PPE would be available to social care providers through a national network of hubs from 27 April 2020.Dundee University Professor of vascular medicine
Jill Belch has spearheaded a Masks for Scotland six-figure fundraising drive to buy PPE for frontline workers.

==
Clinical research ==
Organisations in Scotland involved in COVID-19 related clinical research studies include the Chief Scientist Office's Rapid Research in COVID-19 programme (RARC-19 programme), Health Science Scotland, NHS Research Scotland, Glasgow University, Dundee University, Edinburgh University.
As of 22 April chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said nearly 800 patients have so far taken part in at least 10 clinical studies to develop coronavirus treatments, with another four being set up in hospitals, intensive care units and primary care facilities.
One study is looking at whether existing HIV drugs including Lopinavir and Ritonavir could be used with results available in three months.
Another study led by Dr Kenneth Baillie of Edinburgh University looks at the genetics of patients susceptible to severe illness by comparing patients' DNA with that of healthy people who show no or mild symptoms.

Dundee University is to lead a trial into brensocatib (formerly known as INS1007)
a drug for lung inflammation (acute respiratory distress syndrome) to treat the worst symptoms of coronavirus and prevent the need for ventilation.
Up to 20% of
COVID-19 patients develop lung inflammation which can require them to be ventilated.
The inflammatory response to the virus causes lung damage that can lead to respiratory failure and death in severe cases.
It is hoped the treatment will also lead to patients spending fewer days dependent on oxygen and shorter periods of time in hospital, reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
Funding and drug supply for the STOP-COVID19
(Superiority Trial of Protease Inhibition in COVID-19)
trial is being provided by biopharmaceutical company Insmed Incorporated.
The trial is to start in May and researchers plan to recruit 300 volunteers from 10 hospitals.

The project is led by James Chalmers, professor of respiratory research at Dundee University and consultant respiratory physician at Ninewells Hospital, one of the trial sites.
NHS Tayside research and development director Professor Jacob George is the study investigator.

Health ===
==== Care homes ====
The Guardian's Libby Brooks reported that extra supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) would be delivered directly to more than 1,000 care homes in Scotland.
Before the pandemic the care sector usually sourced its own PPE, but as extreme pressure was put on supply chains concerns grew that PPE manufacturers did not have capacity to deliver to Scotland in adequate quantities.

The Scottish government announced on 17/18 April that the NHS National Services Scotland would prioritise the delivery of stock directly to care homes where the virus is known to be present, although stock would still be provided to local hubs which supply PPE to other social care workers.

Two of the worst suspected outbreaks in care homes occurred at Elderslie care home in Paisley, Renfrewshire and at Berelands House Care in Prestwick, Ayrshire.
Thirteen residents at the Glasgow-based Burlington Care Home died in one week following a suspected outbreak of coronavirus.
The Care Inspectorate has been made aware of the deaths and are in contact with the care service, as well as the local health and social care partnership.
As of 10 May 2020, 474 (44% of all) adult care homes had a current suspected COVID-19 case.
This is a care home where at least one care home resident has exhibited symptoms during the last 14 days.

609 (or 56% of all) adult care homes in Scotland had reported at least one notification for suspected COVID-19 to the Care Inspectorate.
434 of these care homes have reported more than one case of suspected COVID-19.

There have been 4,503 cumulative cases of suspected COVID-19 in care homes.
This is an increase of 58 suspected cases on the previous day.

3,672 staff were reported as absent in adult care homes due to COVID-19, based on returns received from 822 (76%) adult care homes as of
5 May. This represents 8.5% of all adult care home staff (43,403) for whom a return was provided.

==== Effect of Lockdown on NHS services ====
An assessment of the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on motor neuron disease services and mortality in Scotland has shown that there has been no early increase in mortality but that there is a need for vigilance as key services were shown to be impacted upon.

Medicolegal impact of COVID-19 on healthcare professionals ====
The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a spotlight on pre-existing issues in the legal framework in the UK that surround healthcare professionals and patients, encouraging action to be taken now.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many doctors and other healthcare professionals have worked in unfamiliar surroundings and been assigned to new clinical areas, while balancing an unprecedented workload and addressing an overall lack of knowledge about the virus itself.
This has led to concerns that there may be an increase in complaints about treatment provided in these circumstances, and competing arguments on how these should be handled within the criminal, civil and regulatory system.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
As of 29 April 2021, the Ministry of Health has officially reported 2,910 confirmed cases, 2,516 recoveries, and 35 deaths.
Nearly 2.9 million tests have been performed.
Hải Dương Province, as of April 2021 is the most-affected locale with 762 confirmed cases and no deaths.
On 31 December 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.
The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.
Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop in February and March.
Clusters of cases were later detected in Vĩnh Phúc, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City,
Đà Nẵng and Hải Dương Province, with the first death on 31 July 2020.Vietnam has suspended the entry of all foreigners from 22 March 2020 until further notice to limit the spread of COVID-19.
The measure will not apply to diplomats, officials, foreign investors, experts, and skilled workers.
In January 2021, the government announced a stricter quarantine policy to "protect the country" during 2021 Lunar New Year.
Everyone entering Vietnam must be isolated for at least 14-day at the government's quarantine facilities, only special diplomats identified as such by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be exempt.
Vietnam has been cited as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world, along the lines of other highlighted states such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
This success has been attributed to several key factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.
Despite inferior economic and technological capacity, the country's response to the outbreak has received widespread international acclaim for its immediacy, effectiveness and transparency, in contrast to censorship in China and the poor preparation and lackluster response in the United States and in European countries.
Although the pandemic has heavily disrupted the country's economy, Vietnam's GDP growth rate still remained one of the highest in Asia-Pacific Region, at 2.91% in 2020 and projected growth of 6.6% in 2021.Vaccinations commenced on 8 March 2021 with a total of 425,638 people receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by 28 April 2021.
So far, the Ministry of Health has approved COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca and Sputnik V for use in emergencies.
It expected that a total of 150 million doses would be available by the end of 2021.

Background ==
New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public.
Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts.
Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them.
The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population.
Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans.
Although it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who have visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 November.
China publicly reported the cluster on 31 December 2019.
The World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first report on the outbreak on 5 January 2020.
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which was reported earlier.
On January 20, the WHO and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), after mounting evidence that the novel coronavirus had spread to 18 countries and completion of investigation in Wuhan.
Vietnam has a history of successfully managing pandemics: it was the second country after China to face SARS and, after 63 cases and five deaths, it was the first country declared SARS-free by the World Health Organization (WHO).
In the wake of the SARS epidemic, Vietnam increased investments in its public health infrastructure, developing a national public health emergency operations center and a national public health surveillance system, maintaining robust systems to collect and aggregate public data.
Since 2016, hospitals are required to report notifiable diseases within 24 hours to a central database, ensuring that the Ministry of Health can track epidemiological developments across the country.
In collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vietnam implemented an innovative “event-based” surveillance program in 2018, empowering members of the public, including teachers, pharmacists, religious leaders, and even traditional medicine healers, to report public health events, in order to identify clusters of people who have similar symptoms that might suggest an outbreak is emerging.
With a population of nearly 100 million people, receiving the millions of Chinese visitors each year, having long land border and strong economic ties with China, which is Hanoi's largest trading partner, the country was initially perceived to be hit hard by the pandemic.
When Vietnam recorded its two first confirmed cases on 23 January 2020, it was among the first countries affected by COVID-19.
Two weeks later, only 150 cases had been reported outside of mainland China, but ten of these were in Vietnam, placing it in the top ten most affected countries.
However, one year later the situation was very different: instead of having a large scale outbreak, Vietnam was one of the countries with the lowest cases and mortality per million inhabitants.

Timeline ==


===
Overview ===
The first two confirmed cases in Vietnam were admitted to Cho Ray Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City on 22 January 2020.
They were a Chinese man, born in 1954, and his son, the former had flown to Hanoi from Wuhan to visit his son who was believed to have contracted the virus from his father when they met in Nha Trang on 17 January.
The first cluster also appeared in Son Loi Commune, Bình Xuyên District, Vĩnh Phúc
after a few workers returned from a business trip in Wuhan and infected other people in close contact with them.
The Vietnamese government immediately locked down Bình Xuyên District until 4 March 2020 to prevent the disease from spreading all over the country.
Having known cases early is one of the main reasons why Vietnam was successful in fighting the virus.
For the first 16 cases of the disease, the medical staff had to treat different types of patients, including infants, the elderly and people with underlying conditions.
This is like "an exercises" for the Vietnamese medical system in order to prepare and study the new virus.
When the pandemic spreads across the globe, the coronavirus cases in the country also surged, and on the evening of 6 March, Hanoi Department of Health confirmed the first case in the capital, a 26-year-old woman who had travelled to Europe.
This is the 17th case in Vietnam.
On the afternoon of 20 March, the Ministry of Health announced 2 new COVID-19 patients, the 86th and 87th, who were two female nurses at Bạch Mai Hospital with no history of contact with any COVID-19 patients.
In March and April 2020, the number of cases increased rapidly due to the large number of people coming from European countries and the appearance of clusters such as Bạch Mai Hospital, Ha Loi Commune in Hanoi and Buddha Bar in Ho Chi Minh City.
After 21 March 2020, Vietnam suspended entry for all foreigners from midnight of 22 March, and introduced concentrated isolation for 14 days in all cases of entry for Vietnamese citizens.
From 1 April, Vietnam implemented nationwide isolation for 15 days.
On the same day, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc announced the nationwide outbreak of COVID-19.
The drastic epidemic control measures had positive results and the country did not confirm any cases of local transmission from mid-April to the end of July.
Vietnam began loosening restrictions in May, including resuming domestic travel across the country.
The country entered second wave of infection when the Ministry of Health announced the 416th case in Da Nang, which was the first case with an unknown source of infection in 99 days.
On 28 July, the Da Nang authorities immediately locked down the city for 15 days.
Hundreds of cases across the country with epidemiological factors related to Da Nang were furthermore detected, and the first death was also recorded on 31 July.
After two months, by using the same strategies that have been used in the first outbreak, Vietnam has successfully contained the disease for the second time and has resumed almost all economic activities, including international commercial flights.
Sporadic community infections continue during November and December, causing public scare and heightened measures.
The third wave of infection began on 28 January 2021, when Vietnam recorded an additional 84 community transmission cases within a single day in Hải Dương and Quảng Ninh provinces.
Most of these are related to a single Hải Dương migrant worker, who was diagnosed with the UK coronavirus variant by Japanese authorities after arriving in Osaka on 17 January.
Initially, the government only quarantine the areas directly related to the infected people to limit the economic impact.
But after half a month the number of cases still showed no signs of stopping, so on 15 February, entire province of Hải Dương was locked down for 15 days while Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City stopped all entertainment activities.
This is the most serious outbreak happened since the beginning of the pandemic due to slow tracing process, mismanagement in quarantine facilities and people starting to ignore lockdown rules after long period of restrictions.
On 7 March 2021, the outbreak in northern provinces appears to have been largely brought under control when number of new cases fell to single digits.
Along with that, Vietnam started its mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign on the next day.

Drug therapy and vaccine development ===
On 7 February 2020, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi announced that it had successfully cultured and isolated the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the lab, the fourth country to do so.
The achievement would allow quicker test results for nCoV, meaning thousands of samples could be tested a day, said the institute.
It would also serve as a basis for the development of a vaccine against the virus.
Assoc.
Prof., Dr. Le Quynh Mai, Deputy Director of National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, said the virus causing COVID-19 has evolved into many branches.
Three branches have been recorded in the world.
Vietnam recorded and isolated two different virus branches, one from patients returning from Wuhan in February and the other from patients returning from Europe in March.
In May 2020, Vietnam declared that their COVID-19 vaccine was developed after scientists successfully generated the novel coronavirus antigen in the lab.
The vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists at VABIOTECH in Hanoi and the Bristol University, it will be tested further in animals and evaluated for safety and effectiveness before a manufacturing process is embarked on.
According to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, it will take at least 12–18 months to develop vaccine that can work safely on human.
During the testing phase, researchers experimented by injecting the mice in many ways and administering multiple antigen doses, with some mice injected with one or two doses of 3-10 micrograms each.
After 10 days, 50 mice were in good health and being closely monitored for immune responses.
After gaining positive results with immune response and antibody production, the trial vaccine would be developed into a complete and stable version qualified to be used on humans.
The research team would also develop commercial production procedures for mass-production, including up to tens of millions of units.
In October 2020, the Vabiotech COVID-19 vaccine has been tested on 12 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in an island off the northern Quang Ninh province.
The macaques are aged 3–5, weighing more than three kilograms each, and not infected with contagious diseases like tuberculosis or the HIV virus.
Before being injected with the vaccine, they had their body temperatures, blood and swab samples taken and were kept separately in cages.
They will be tested in two periods.
In each period, they will be divided into two groups, with one being vaccinated and the other not.
After that, they will be monitored daily on separate islands, before their blood samples are taken for further analysis.
The testing will follow a similar model that maybe later performed on humans.
The animals will be injected two shots of the vaccine, 18 to 21 days apart.
A month after the second shot, researchers will assess the monkeys' immune response to see the difference between the injected group and the non-injected group.
The result of these trials will be presented before the health ministry's ethical board within the following four months if experiments show the vaccine does produce effective immunogenicity and provide effective protection against COVID-19.
It will be a foundation for the next stage for testing the vaccine on humans.
Vietnam currently has four COVID-19 vaccines produced by Nanogen, Vabiotech, Polyvac and the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) currently under research.
The health ministry has assessed the Nanocovax vaccine produced by Nanogen is the most promising, having been successfully produced it on a laboratory scale and provoked immunogenicity during animal testing.
IVAC and Vabiotech have completed their laboratory-scale production process and are evaluating the safety and immunity of their vaccines on animals.
On 7 December, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology announced the Nanocovax test results on hamsters.
The hamsters were vaccinated and then exposed to the novel coronavirus for 14 days.
They were not infected and results from lung fluid tests also showed they were negative for the virus.
Meanwhile, mice that were not vaccinated tested positive for the novel coronavirus and showed signs of fatigue.
On 17 December 2020, Nanogen commenced human trials of Nanocovax vaccine.
On 26 February 2021, the pharmaceutical company began second phase trials in two places, Hanoi and southern Long An province.
On 25 March, 26 volunteers receiving the first jabs in phase II between 26 February and 10 March were given the second shots of the Nanocovax vaccine.
Some volunteers experienced side effects around the injection site, yet did not require medical intervention.
Results of the trial will be issued in May 2021 before preparing for the third-stage trial, giving the vaccine to between 10,000 and 30,000 people to test for efficacy and safety.
Nanocovax vaccine may be ready to deliver to the general public in the second half of 2021, if efficacy is shown.
If the government goes ahead with the emergency decision, it may be rolled out in May, a Nanogen official told Nikkei Asia.
On 26 March, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Phạm Công Tạc and Deputy Prime Minister
Vũ Đức Đam received the second dose of the Nanocovax COVID-19 vaccine.
On 21 January, the second Vietnam produced COVID-19 vaccine (COVIVAC) by Institute of Vaccine and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) has entered a human-clinical trial, nearly two months ahead of schedule.
COVIVAC vaccine has been studied by IVAC since May 2020, has carried out pre-clinical trials in India, US and Vietnam, the results show safety and efficacy in experiment, fully meeting the conditions for conducting research with humans participants.
The vaccine stability evaluation was conducted at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City.
On 15 March 2021, six volunteers were injected with the COVIVAC vaccine, at the Hà Nội Medical University.
The COVIVAC is a liquid vaccine with or without adjuvants, without preservatives, with the production technology of Newcastle vector vaccine, based on production technology on chicken eggs with embryos.

117,600 doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine arrived at Tan Son Nhat international airport in Ho Chi Minh City on 24 February.
On 16 March, Vietnam received 1,000 doses of Sputnik V from Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev.
The first batch of vaccines sourced via Covax mechanism, containing 811,200 doses, arrived in Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport on 1 April 2021.
It expected that a total of 150 million doses would be available by the end of 2021.Vietnam's COVID-19 vaccination programme began on 8 March 2021, administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to medical workers in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Hải Dương province.
This is the country's ever-largest immunization campaign with over 150 million doses.
The country is expected to reach its vaccination coverage target of 80% in June 2022.
As of 28 April 2021, 425,638 people have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

===
Treatment ===
From the experiences gained from the SARS outbreak in 2003, Vietnam has been proactive in treating COVID-19 patients.
Accordingly, the key method is to create a well-ventilated environment, do not use air conditioning and regularly disinfect.
In addition, the treatment of clinical symptoms combined with physiotherapy and appropriate nutrition and psychological stability also greatly contributes.
According to the Vietnam Ministry of Health, specific antiretroviral therapy will also be considered when sufficient evidence of effectiveness is available.
To leave the hospital, patients need to have two consecutive negative samples of COVID-19 (both pharyngeal and pharyngeal fluid), taken at least 24 hours/test.
After leaving the hospital, the patient must continue to isolate at home for another 14 days.
The patient should be in a well-ventilated private room wearing mask, washing hand everyday, limiting contact with other family members and not to go out.
Monitor body temperature twice per day, check again immediately if fever or other abnormal signs.
During the second wave in Da Nang, the treatment regimen used in Vietnam underwent many improvements.
Compared to the beginning of 2020, patients mainly treated by their symptoms and medical staffs will try to improve their condition, while in the new regimen, antiviral drugs proved more effective for COVID-19 patients.
Specifically, Lopinavir, Ritonavir and Interferon have been used effectively by Vietnam, with patients becoming virus free after 7 days of use.
The method of extracting plasma from cured people to treat severe cases is also being considered as an alternative to antiviral drugs.
The malaria drugs
Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine are no longer used for treatment.
Doctors have been studying plasma therapy for COVID-19 treatment since April 2020 and the Hanoi National Hospital for Tropical Diseases still continues to select plasma donors.
However, no patient in the country has been treated with this method.
Dr. Nguyen Trung Cap, deputy director of the Hanoi National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, explained that plasma therapy is based on the principle of using antibodies already in cured individuals to supporting the treatment of newly infected patient.
Antibodies can help reduce the amount of virus in the body of the sick person, thereby reducing the severity of the disease.
Plasma can be very effective in treating many diseases, but with COVID-19 the benefits are still limited.
During the first week of illness, the amount of virus in the patient's body is very high but most of them only experiencing mild symptoms.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to administer plasma from the cured to the new patient.
Severe symptoms usually occurs from the second week of illness due to an excessive immune response.
However, in many patients the amount of virus in their body has decreased, the use of plasma is not much value.
In addition, shortly after the patient has recovered from COVID-19, the amount of antibodies in the plasma decreases quite rapidly, so the benefit of the blood plasma is reduced in the treatment of the disease.
Plasma transfusion also has a mechanism similar to blood transfusion, this therapy may contain similar side effects like fluid overload, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction or allergic transfusion reaction when transfusing the wrong blood type.
In October 2020, the scientists at the Medical Genetics Institute, the Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control (HCDC) and Ho Chi Minh
City Medicine and Pharmacy University are planning to sequence the genomes of novel coronavirus to understand how it affects people with different genetic makeups and possibly identify genes sensitive to the virus for better treatment method.
In the first stage of the research, twenty recovered patients would have their genes sequenced with the help of HCDC.

===
New virus strain ===
The newly acquired COVID-19 strain that entered Vietnam in the second wave has a mutation which increases the infection rates, leading to a high number of cases in a second wave.
Nguyen Thanh Long, Minister of Health, said that this new strain was imported from outside of Vietnam.
The epidemic may already have started in early July.
Until August, Da Nang has gone through 4 cycles of infection.
The basic reproduction number (R0) in the second wave was 5 to 6, while in April this was only from 1.8 to 2.2.
The rate of positive results of people who had indirect contact with COVID-19 patients are also higher than in the previous wave.
Scientists point out that this strain of the virus is aggressive and capable of causing a transition to a serious condition more quickly.
The health ministry sent the best experts to Da Nang to help the city contain the spread of the infection and to quickly identify the source of the infection.
They also submitted the new strain's data to a world gene bank for comparison.
On 4 August, the Ministry of Health confirmed that the strain of coronavirus in Vietnam in the second wave is D614G, also the dominant mutation wreaking havoc across the globe.
A study published by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico asserts that patients infected by that mutation actually have more virus in their bodies, making them more likely to spread it to others.
As of February 2021, Vietnam recorded at least five coronavirus strains: the original Wuhan variant, the UK variant (Lineage B.1.1.7), Indian variant, South African variant, A.23.1 from Rwanda, CAL.20C variant and D614G coronavirus mutation.

===
Relapse ===
Many COVID-19 cases in Vietnam have reported positive tests after they were deemed to have recovered from the disease.
This also happened in other countries such as United States, South Korea and China.
Dr. Oh Myoung-don, head of South Korea Central Clinical Committee for Emerging Disease Control rejected the possibility of "reinfection", assuming that the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, most likely due to "the testing kit collected RNA from the dead virus fragments, these may remain in the body for months".
Vietnam Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long also agreed with the above opinion, saying that maybe the patient has not fully recovered during the treatment process so the virus has not been completely eliminated and still exists in the body, especially in lung mucous cells.
In April 2021, the Ministry of Health decided to shorten isolation time at home to 7 days because it did not record community infections from relapse cases.
Previously, Vietnam forced concentrated quarantine from immigrants for 14 days in the isolation camp and 14 days at home.

===
Testing ===
On 30 January 2020, the Ministry of Science and Technology had a meeting with medical experts to propose solutions to contain and mitigate COVID-19.
In the meeting, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Phạm Công Tạc urged virologists to accelerate the development of diagnostic tests.
Starting in early February, publicly funded institutions in Vietnam developed at least four locally made COVID-19 tests that were validated by the Ministry of Defense and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.
Subsequently, private companies including Viet A and Thai Duong offered capacity to manufacture the test kits.
Most confirmation laboratories where these tests are analyzed use in-house versions of WHO protocol, allowing tests to be widely administered without long wait times.
Early February 2020, a research team in Institute of Biotechnology and Food Technology
(Hanoi University of Science and Technology)
just announced they had successful developed test kits utilizing the RT-LAMP technology with testing time of 70 minutes.
On 3 March, leader of the research team – Assoc.
Prof. Dong Van Quyen, Deputy Director of the Institute of Biotechnology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, announced that they had completed the research and development of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, based on RT-PCR and realtime RT-PCR.
Two days later, the Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology announced the result of researching and manufacturing a biological kit to detect novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) conducted by Military Medical Academy, commercialized by Viet A Technology JSC.The kit has been tested for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and repeatability at the lab of Viet A Technology JSC.
and Vietnam Military Medical Academy.
The results show that the criteria are equivalent to the kit produced by the CDC and the World Health Organization.
Independent testing at the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, evaluating on patient samples, compatible with 5 types of common devices in medical facilities in the country, gave 100% accurate results in all of the tests.
The kit detection time is about 2 hours.
After being licensed by the Ministry of Health, 20 countries have ordered the test kit.
The first four countries to receive kits will be Malaysia, Iran, Finland and Ukraine, as of 17 March 2020.In August 2020, the Ministry of Health approved the use of GeneXpert, a type of test that has been used by the Vietnam tuberculosis prevention network since 2012, for COVID-19 testing.
According to Nguyễn Viết Nhung, director of the National Lung Hospital in Hanoi, the test is similar to RT-PCR, gives accurate results within 35–45 minutes for both COVID-19 and tuberculosis and could work automatically.
Plans are underway to further expand the use of GeneXpert using 14,000 GeneXpert COVID-19 cartridges in 42-46 lung hospitals around the country.
As of April 2021, Vietnam has 169 laboratories capable of testing for COVID-19 using RT-PCR.
The maximum capacity in the country remains at 62,593 tests per day.
Health officials are currently preparing to extend testing capacity to more hospital laboratories including provincial and military hospitals, with further training ongoing, for preparedness in case of future widespread transmission.
During the outbreak in Hải Dương, instead of mass testing on every person in the infected area, the authorities using different strategies including targeted testing of higher risk groups as well as random testing of households and inpatients.
Testing capacity also can be increased with guidance issued on pooling of lower risk specimens, up to 10 specimens at most.
==
Government response ==
Vietnam has prepared for the epidemic as early as the very first case in China emerged, around mid-December 2019.
Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ordered measures to prevent and counter the spread of the disease into Vietnam, as well as to warn Vietnamese citizens to avoid visiting areas with outbreaks.
Deputy Minister Đỗ Xuân Tuyên said that Vietnam is considering closing the border with China as a necessary countermeasure.
According to Kidong Park, World Health Organization representative to Vietnam, the first risk assessment exercise was conducted by the Vietnamese in early January – soon after cases in China started being reported.
On 3 January 2020, the day before the WHO said there was a cluster of cases in Wuhan, Vietnam tightened control at the Vietnam-China border.
On 11 January 2020, after China reported the first coronavirus death, Vietnam implemented health checks at airports.
All visitors had their body temperatures measured, and those with a fever, cough, chest pain or breathing difficulties were isolated for testing.
Confirmed cases, fellow passengers and crew and all their contacts were quarantined for 14 days.
The Ministry of Health held a meeting with the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as early as 15 January, weeks before many other countries even started strategizing.
These combined efforts of quick action and effective testing helped slow the spread of the virus in its earliest stages.
Regional COVID-19 prevention task forces were established, and these groups were prepared for deployment by the Ministry of Health to provincial treatment sites.
In view of an assumed increased infection risk among medical staff as had been seen during the SARS outbreak, personal protective equipment was stockpiled, and infection control measures were heightened at hospitals.
On 22 January, health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.
On 23 January, Vietnam confirmed its first case.
Shortly afterward, the Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ramped up Vietnam's response by issuing an urgent document to ministries, provinces, and broadcasting agencies addressing the dangerousness of the virus and the need for measures to prevent local transmission.
On 24 January, just one day after the first cases, the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam ordered the cancellation of all flights from and to Wuhan.
As Vietnam celebrated the Tết holiday, the Prime Minister declared war on the coronavirus. "
Fighting this epidemic is like fighting the enemy", he said at an urgent Communist Party meeting on 27 January.
On 31 January, infectious disease expert Nguyễn Thanh Long was appointed as deputy Minister of Health and later as Minister of Health, he served as one of the main government advisors regarding the pandemic.
On the same day, Vietnam implemented stricter measures, suspending inbound and outbound flights related to the epicenters in China, restricting tourists, dosing train connection, and suggested people suspend trade and other exchange activities between the two countries.
Such a decision to limit cross-border transactions with China indicated the extent of the government's commitment to prioritizing public health.
In January, the government also issued the first National Response Plan and assembled the National Steering Committee (NSC).
The committee, led by Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam with representation from 14 ministries and sectors, the National Assembly, media, and information technology companies will command and control the country COVID-19 response.
Vietnam also has 63 provincial health departments, an approximately 600 district health centers and more than 11,000 primary health stations.
While hospitals provide medical care for COVID-19 patients, the primary health stations are responsible for prevention activities and total support for hospitals.
In fact, an approximately 97,000 health officers at community level in these sections serve as the workers to provide information, advice, guidance, and isolation facilities if needed.
In February 2020, Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training suspended all school activities across the country until the end of March as part of quarantine measures against the spreading of the virus, and later extended this till the middle of April until further notice.
Aggressive measures were also taken to combat possible outbreaks, from 14 days quarantine to restriction of outdoor activities (some sources believe it was more than 20 to 40 days under quarantine), the Vietnam People's Armed Forces also takes part on patrolling and controlling measures.
Sixty-eight military camps with a capacity of 40,000 people were set up to receive people ordered into quarantine.
On 9 February, the Ministry of Health held a teleconference with the WHO and 700 hospitals at all levels nationwide to disseminate information on nCoV prevention and launched a website to disseminate information to the wider public.
The first case of mass quarantine in Vietnam took place on February 12 in Sơn Lôi, Vĩnh Phúc, an community of 10,000 people for 20 days over seven coronavirus cases – the first large-scale lockdown known outside China.
Aggressive preventive action enabled Vietnam to contain the outbreak, with only 16 cases, all recovered, by the end of February.
On the night of 6 March, when the 17th case was reported in Hanoi, the city held an urgent meeting, then coordinated with related ministries — including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Security, and Ministry of Transportation — to prevent the virus from spreading to the community.
Thanks to this effective coordination, public health measures such as aggressive contact tracing, mandatory quarantine, and sterilization of surfaces were taken immediately, which enabled the government to stop community transmission and lift the large-scale lockdown still common in many Southeast Asian nations at that time.
On March 7, Hanoi locked down Bach Truc Street, where the patient resided along with 66 households and 189 people.
The quarantine was lifted on March 20 after no new cases were reported after testing.
Imported cases from Europe motivated the government to intensify its border control measures, reducing international flights, suspending visa waiver for certain European countries.
When the Bạch Mai Hospital in Hanoi became a coronavirus hotspot with dozens of cases in late March, the authorities imposed a lockdown on the facility and tracked down nearly 100,000 people related to the hospital, including medics, patients, visitors and their close contacts.

===
April nationwide isolation ===
On 31 March 2020, Vietnamese government ordered a nationwide isolation of 15 days from 1 to 15 April.
From 16 April, local airlines could raise the number of domestic flights, which were subsequently further increased on 23 April and again on 29 April.
On 23 April 2020, Vietnamese government lifted social isolation rule, subsequently allowing re-opening of non-essential services including restaurants.
On the same day, schools across the country could be re-opened, with dates varying per each province and city case.
Everyone who enters Vietnam from abroad, however, continued to be quarantined upon arrival for 14 days.
From 23 April, plans for repatriation flights to bring Vietnamese citizens abroad back to Vietnam
were re-newed, with an initial plan for 13 flights.
Among the flights conducted was notably the first-ever direct flight in history operated by Vietnam Airlines from Vietnam to the United States on 7 May.
From 9 May, cinemas were reopened.
On 11 May, Vietnamese government started a nationwide tourism campaign, named 'Vietnamese travel Vietnam', to increase domestic demand for travelling and promote domestic tourism.

===
Lockdown of Da Nang ===
In late-July, Vietnam was placed on high alert after the government confirmed dozens of community infections, the first since April, all in or around Da Nang.
On 27 July, the government made the drastic decision to begin evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, a process it said would take four days with domestic airlines operating approximately 100 flights daily from Da Nang to 11 cities around the country.
On the same day, the Da Nang Municipal People's Committee announced restrictions applicable for 15 days, starting from 28 July.
Six districts in quarantine area include: Hai Chau, Thanh Khe, Son Tra, Ngu Hanh Son, Cam Le, and Lien Chieu District with more than one million people requested to stay at home and only go out in case of extreme necessity such as buying food, medicine,seeking essential goods and services, and medical emergencies.
All educational and non-essential services in the city was closed.
Face masks were mandated in public and people were ordered to frequently wash their hands with soap or alcoholic sanitisers.
Gatherings of more than two people in public are disallowed and maintenance of a minimum distance of 2 meters is required.
All types of public transport were halted and personal vehicles were heavily restricted.
The Da Nang Department of Health was asked to promptly organize epidemiological investigation, contact-tracing in areas related to the confirmed cases, and massive testing to early detect infection sources and high-risk cases.
The rural district of Hoa Vang was the last district to be quarantined, starts from 13:00, 28 July 2020.
On 31 July, the neighboring city of Hội An were also placed under quarantine for 15 days after at least 4 people tested positive with COVID-19.The authorities also decided to lockdown four hospitals: Da Nang C Hospital, Da Nang Hospital, Da Nang Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Hospital and Hoan
My Hospital where the patients visited just before they were confirmed positive for COVID-19.According to the regulation of the Ministry of Transport issued on 27 July to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic:
After the midnight of 28 July 2020, Da Nang International Airport will be temporarily closed.
All public vehicles such as tourist buses, taxis, public buses in the area of Da Nang must stop operating, except for government vehicles, emergency vehicles and any vehicles transporting necessities.
Any car traveling through Da Nang cannot stop to pick up passengers in the city.

Vietnam Railways has been instructed to suspend the operation of passenger trains to and from Da Nang station.
North–South trains are still operating normally on the route but do not stop when entering the city area.
Passenger boats and ferry services originating from Da Nang are also prohibited.
Aircraft, ships and vehicles transporting cargo are not affected by this regulation.

On 12 August, Da Nang has decided to continue social distancing for another two weeks when the number of cases in the community still shows no signs of stopping.
The local government also issued "shopping coupons" for residents, each family will be given five coupons to use within 15 days, in order to prevent large gatherings at markets.

Da Nang is an example [of the importance] of human resources, medical facility.
Despite many efforts but the central government still have to total mobilize to support.
If an epidemic occurs in a mountainous province it will be even more difficult.
Must be determined that from now on there will be no time of peace, but the readiness for an outbreak.

===
Field hospital ===
On 31 July 2020, the Da Nang Party Committee announced that they will use Tien Son Sport Center in Hải Châu District as a temporary field hospital to help the city's hospitals cope with the rising number of COVID-19 patients in the area.
The sport center covers a floor space of 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) with a maximum capacity of 2,000 beds.
In the meeting, the committee also agreed to use the sports ground of the Da Nang Military Command to store necessities and medical equipment to support the prevention and control of the epidemic.
Mr. Huynh Duc Tho, Chairman of Da Nang People's Committee, stated that the situation of COVID-19 epidemic in the area was very dangerous and that drastic action and strong measures would be required to control the outbreak.
The Party Committee tasked the city with urgently buying necessary medical equipment, including ECMO machines, ventilators, protective suits and medical masks.
In January 2021, in response to COVID-19 outbreak in Hải Dương, two field hospitals with a combined capacity of 600 beds have been set up in northern Hải Dương province within 24 hours.
The first one was built at the medical centre of Chi Linh city, and staffed by 45 doctors and about 70 nurses who can provide treatment for 200 patients.
The second one converted from the Hải Dương Medical Technical University with 210 beds.
===
Monitoring apps ===
On 9 March, the health declaration application named NCOVI was officially launched.
After installing NCOVI application on smartphones, people enter full personal information as required to start using.
Based on the data submitted, the health system will know the cases that need attention to ensure the fastest and most effective medical assistance.
In April, Vietnamese cyber security firm Bkav launched Bluezone, an application that uses Bluetooth low energy positioning technology to detect people in close contact with infected people via smartphones quickly, and accurately.
Smartphones with Bluezone installed can communicate with each other,
record close contact at a distance of 2 meters, when and for how long to help users know and control patient contacts COVID-19.
These app has drawn concerns about users information safety and their privacy.
Gathering all citizens data in one place will make tracing disease easier and more efficient, but it also means that Bluezone, will know users contacted with whom, for how long, and when.
From this information it can find out the social graph of the majority of people in the country.

===
Public communication and propaganda ===
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government has communicated clearly with the public, setting up websites and telephone hotlines to update on the latest situations.
The Ministry of Health also regularly sent out reminders to citizens via text messaging and apps during the crisis, as well as publishing extensive amounts of data and information about the outbreak.
Messages on preventive measures such as wearing of mask and physical distancing have been reinforced using infographics and audio-visual materials.
On a busy day, the national hotlines alone could receive 20,000 calls, not to count the hundreds of provincial and district-level hotlines.
Vietnam is also relying on its propaganda apparatus to help tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Central Propaganda Department is responsible for disseminating the propaganda through mass media.
Their efforts usually focus on the nationalism, successful measures by the government to control the pandemic, the steady improvement of the situation across the country and the advantages of the one-party political system in dealing with crisis.
On the streets, public art in the style of Cold War-era propaganda posters has flourished, exalting nurses instead of guerrillas.
The government and local media outlets have used the phrase Cuộc chiến với Covid-19 (War against COVID-19) to illustrate the efforts and sacrifices required to contain the pandemic.

===
Vaccine diplomacy ===
While vaccination efforts intensify around the world, Vietnam is one of very few middle-income countries in the process of making its own COVID-19 vaccine.
Two Vietnamese vaccines have become the first vaccines to be developed in Southeast Asia to begin clinical trials.

As the majority of vaccine doses go to the United States and Europe, most drug companies are unwilling to share their technology and many countries can't afford to purchase the necessary doses.
Like many governments, Vietnam is also wary of becoming over reliant on any single country for its vaccines.
But Vietnam's vaccine development is more than ensure health security, this also helps the country's to enhance its geopolitical status.
The vaccines may allow Vietnamese government to position itself as a leader among developing countries by supporting their access to the drugs and their recovery as a whole.
While drug companies in the US and the UK are firmly attached to their patents and restrict production overseas, Hanoi would offer countries a cheap, reliable and politically neutral vaccine alternative.

===
Financial support ===
On 10 April 2020, Vietnamese government has passed a VND62 trillion ($2.6 billion) financial support package, directly supporting people in difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beneficiaries of this support package include employees who have to postpone labour contracts, part-time workers who are unemployed but have not received unemployment benefits, enterprises have no revenue or no financial source to pay salaries, employers, individual business households and people with meritorious services to the nation.
However, the disbursement of the support package still faces many difficulties and delays because many reason.
According to the United Nations, Vietnamese government has issued and is implementing a multi-sectoral response to address the social and economic impact of the crisis.
The table below summarizes Government policy in support of affected people and enterprises in response to COVID-19.

According to MOLISA, by 29 June 2020, more than 11 million individuals from an approved list of 15.8 million vulnerable people and 6,196 household businesses had received more than 11 trillion VND ($477 million USD) in the social assistance package.
However, MOLISA reports indicated some key challenges in implementing this package, including complicated procedures leading to late delivery of cash and limited local funds (30-50% of total local funds) among poor provinces, such as Bình Định, Hòa Bình, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa.
A rapid assessment in May 2020 conducted by the Department of Social Protection with all provinces on the COVID-19 social assistance package indicated that informal workers, small businesses and families with children faced difficulties accessing this package, due to complex registration and screening procedures.
Therefore, innovative methods will need to be introduced to support consumer spending and reduce vulnerability among people who have lost employment and earnings during the pandemic.

===
Cyberattacks on China ===
According to Reuters, APT32, a hacker group backed by Vietnamese government, also known as OceanLotus or Cobalt Kitty, has tried to compromise the personal and professional email accounts of staff at China's Ministry of Emergency Management and the local government of Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic.
This group has also been accused of compromising "governments, businesses and health agencies in search of information about the new disease and attempts to combat it.
"However
, Vietnam says reports that it has supported hacker group APT32 to steal information on COVID-19 from China are ‘baseless’.
"
This is baseless information.
Vietnam strictly forbids cyberattack behavior targeting organizations and individuals in any form", Foreign Affairs Ministry deputy spokesman Ngo Toan Thang said at an online press meet.

=== Evacuation and repatriation ===
By the end of 2020, more than 75,000 Vietnamese people have been flown back to the country on 260 repatriation flights from 59 countries and territories around the world.
On 13 July, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc allowed the resumption of commercial flights to and from China after five months of shutdown of international flights to control COVID-19.On 28 July, Vietnam Airlines repatriation flight VN05 departed from Hanoi to Equatorial Guinea to bring 219 Vietnamese workers back to Vietnam.
According to the airline statement, the Airbus A350 will fly directly from Noi Bai International Airport to the city of Bata for more than 12 hours, then stop picking up passengers and refueling for 3 hours, then return to Vietnam.
The aircraft is expected to land at Hanoi at 11:20 on 29 July.
Of the 219 returning workers, 129 were infected with COVID-19.
On the plane, there are 2 doctors and 2 nurses of the Hanoi National Hospital of Tropical Diseases to promptly provide emergency and support to the patients.
Health authorities also arrange a variety of medical equipment to support passengers.
Medical stretchers are mounted on aircraft, providing emergency aid for serious patients.

Local reactions ==
The report issued by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Mekong Development Research Institute (MDRI), surveyed 1,335 Vietnamese in September for their opinions and experiences of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Respondents showed strong support for the government's national social distancing order imposed in April, with 88% praising its appropriate timing.
A total 39% said they followed the social distancing order, while 12.2% either somewhat followed or disobeyed it.
A total 89% of respondents said they supported the government's stance and measures to save as many lives as possible, even if it means the economy might recover more slowly.
The percentage is much higher than the global average of 67% agreeing the government should prioritize saving lives over economic recovery.
A survey conducted by Singapore's United Overseas Bank, has found that the Vietnamese are the most optimistic in Southeast Asia about their future despite the economic and social challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Around 81% of Vietnamese respondents said they expect life to go back to normal by the end of this year, while 72% believed they would be financially better. "
Their optimism could be due to Vietnam’s success in handling the COVID-19 crisis, which has set a strong foundation for the recovery of the economy," Harry Loh, CEO of UOB Vietnam said.
Another reason why Vietnamese people are most optimistic in times of crisis may be because most of them grew up during the war and the “Subsidy Economy” period.

===
Xenophobia ===
The Asia Times reported that "A number of Vietnamese hotels and guesthouses have reportedly hung signs on their doors saying that Chinese guests are not welcome, while many Vietnamese have gone online to demand the closure of all border crossings with China.
"
Signs suggesting that Chinese customers were not welcome were seen in front of a shop in Phú Quốc and a restaurant in Da Nang.
South Korean nationals are also reportedly screened due to the rampant outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea, which has extensive trade relationship with Vietnam.
When racism started to get more coverage on social media and in the news, the Vietnamese government made a declaration that people could be fined for refusal of service to foreigners.
They also provided a hotline for foreigners to call for assistance and to report the situation.
The xenophobic attitudes also occurred in the use of Chinese vaccines in the vaccination program.
Nguyen Phuong Linh, lead analyst of Control Risks consultancy firm, said China's vaccine diplomacy had failed with Vietnam mainly because of anti-China sentiments.
For successfully managing COVID-19, Vietnamese leaders have gained strong support from the public – which they would not want to lose by using Chinese vaccines for the majority of the population. "
From the beginning of the pandemic, the virus has been widely reported in Vietnam as originally coming from China.
Since then, the anti-China sentiments, which were already strong, have shown no sign of weakening.
",
she said.

===
Charity ===
Not only with the help of the government, many sponsors have provided food and water to the poor with many positive actions such as "rice ATMs" and free supermarkets.
This assistance has contributed greatly to helping the society most vulnerable.

A number of business people and famous people also contributed to the people and the government to support the fight against COVID-19 epidemic.
At a meeting with representatives of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee of Ho Chi Minh City on the morning of 20 March, billionaire Johnathan Hanh Nguyen made a pledge to donate 30 billion VND, of which 25 billion VND was used to pay for medical equipment.
In addition, he also handed over a 5000m2 supermarket for use as an isolation area.
According to Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Overseas Vietnamese Luong Thanh Nghi, as soon as the epidemic broke out in China and some countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the Vietnamese community was living, studying and working in Eastern Europe have donated and transported nearly 80,000 medical masks, hundreds of sterile water bottles, protective clothes and medical gloves to support Son Loi commune, Vĩnh Phúc province and a number of hospitals in Hanoi to prevent and fight epidemics.
In August 2020, Vietnamese largest corporation Vingroup handed 3,200 ventilators and enough chemicals to performing 100,000 RT-PCR tests to the Ministry of Health.

===
Disobedience to quarantine rules ===
Although the authorities have put in place mandatory measures to prevent the spread of disease, there are some people still escaping the quarantined area or dishonest reporting about their symptoms, these actions caused serious consequences to the public.
In March 2020, the first patient in Hanoi (patient #17) did not provide an accurate travel history, which made it difficult for immigration officers to know she had travelled through
and so that she could avoid concentrated quarantine.
This lack of responsibility has caused many people to be infected, making hundreds of people in the neighborhood and a hospital placed under quarantine, putting stress on the city health system.
Anger was also reported due to the increasing number of the infected cases coming from the Muslim community returning from Malaysia following their attendance of the Tablighi Jamaat festival in Sri Petaling mosque, and two to three patients did not obey the self-quarantine law in Vietnam and still attended Islamic events in Ho Chi Minh City, leading to fury and demands to imprison the Muslim population, even among Vietnamese celebrities.
A 28-years-old Vietnam Airlines attendant known as patient 1342 breached self-isolation protocols when going outside and studying at a university.
He infected his friend, a 32-year-old English teacher, breaking Vietnam's 88-day streak without community transmission.
The teacher went on to infect at least two others, his one-year-old nephew and a 28-year-old student.
The attendant said he left home in Tân Bình District at noon on 21 November to have dinner in Phú Nhuận District then visited HUTECH University in Bình Thạnh District.
The university has since been locked down and its students were requested to stay home.
According to the director of Ho Chi Minh City health department, patient 1342 not just violated the rules of self-quarantine at home, but also of the Vietnam Airlines quarantine facility.
He had intruded into the space of another flight crew and contracted the virus from another attendant who had been confirmed as patient 1325 on 26 November.
Under the health ministry's directions, the Vietnam Airlines quarantine facility was closed.
Ho Chi Minh City police has opened a criminal investigation into the Vietnam Airlines flight attendant's breach of COVID-19 quarantine protocols.
He has been suspended from his job and faces possible dismissal, while his company will be inspected for compliance with disease prevention regulations, quarantine processes and supervision at quarantine facilities.

===
Frauds ===
On 3 March 2020, a warehouse containing nearly 1 million masks of unknown origin were discovered after the inspection by the police in Tân Phú District, Ho Chi Minh City.
Many other cases involving masks of unknown origins, illegally produced, stored and traded have been detected, prevented and charged in time, such as in An Giang, Lạng Sơn, Cao Bằng, and Quảng Ninh, many other cases of production fake mask, illegal transportation of medical supplies abroad, also including collection and sale discarded masks or used masks to the public.
On 17 April 2020, at the meeting of the Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control of Hanoi, Mr. Nguyen Duc Chung, Chairman of Hanoi People's Committee said that the Investigation Police Department on Economic, Corruption Crimes and Smuggling (C03) of the Ministry of Public Security invited some officials of the Hanoi Center for Disease Control (HCDC) to the investigation about the purchase process of the COVID-19 testing machine.
On 22 April 2020, investigator determined that Mr. Nguyen Nhat Cam, director of the Hanoi CDC, and his accomplices had raised the purchase price for a COVID-19 test kit package using the real-time PCR system by three times.
Accordingly, the Investigation Police Department issued a decision to arrest him and six more people on charges of fraudulently buying COVID-19 testing machines.
They will be probed on charges of violating bidding regulations causing serious consequences, an offence that can fetch jail terms of up to 20 years.

===
YTN News incident ===
On 24 February 2020, a group of 20 South Korean visitors arrived in Da Nang on a flight from Daegu which was South Korea's COVID-19 epicentre.
When being informed about the isolation for monitoring by local authorities, some people in the group refused.
They were temporarily kept at the Da Nang Lung Disease Hospital before boarding a flight sponsored by the Vietnamese government back to South Korea the following day.
After receiving complaints from few South Korean about the quarantined area, YTN has broadcast a controversial news report that Korean citizens are being "detained" under poor conditions.
Accordingly, the people who appeared in the video said that even without any symptoms of coronavirus, they were still "detained" in a locked room, and not provided with adequate meals.
Notably, this news also criticised the small isolation room, containing 2-3 people.
Immediately after broadcasting and posting the news video on YouTube, YTN received a backlash from Vietnamese netizens.
Some people demanded the news agency to apologise for posting false information.
Under pressure from netizens, on 2 March, on their official website, YTN News had to publish an apology about the incident.
In the statement, YTN stressed that they would continue to tell the truth and protect South Korean citizens, but at the same time be more careful with broadcasting style to avoid misunderstandings, especially regarding cultural differences.

Assessment

===
Compliments ===
In comparison to other commended examples like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, Vietnam had experienced a much lower number of cases, and no fatalities for six consecutive months — an achievement recalling the success in 2003 when Vietnam became the first country to be cleared of the SARS outbreak.
Even after dozens of deaths recorded during the second wave, the toll in Vietnam against its population, peaking at the rate of 0.4 deaths per million people, remains lower than most of the world.
Researcher Martha Lincoln, the San Francisco State medical anthropologist, who has worked in Vietnam extensively, describes Vietnam's public health response as "impeccable and relentless".
Vietnam responded to the pandemic "early and proactively", as complimented by World Health Organization representative Kidong Park, with risk assessment conducted just after first reported cases in China in January.
The country is accredited by Professor Mike Toole from the Burnet Institute with acting "probably faster than any country in the world outside China".
Toole points out that Vietnam had already developed three COVID-19 test kits by early March, the time when the U.S. had not even acquired an effective one.
The Guardian praised Vietnam's propaganda posters reflecting the wartime spirit and Vietnamese nationalism, along with early isolation and tracing objects in contact with the sick helped Vietnam avoid the disaster that Europe is suffering.
Another the reasons Vietnam was able to act so quickly and keep the case count so low is that the country experienced a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and human cases of avian influenza between 2004 and 2010.
As a result, Vietnam had both the experience and infrastructure to take appropriate action.
Vietnam makes many key containment decisions in a matter of days, which may take weeks for governments in other countries to make.
Although Vietnam is a highly centralized country, a number of key decisions were made at the local level, which also contributed to the swift response.
One of the unique parts of Vietnam's response is its meticulous contact-tracing effort.
Due to its inability to conduct mass testing like South Korea, Vietnam has taken a targeted approach to testing, scaling it up in areas with community transmission, implementing a strict 14-day quarantine policy, and keeping track of second, third and fourth levels of contact to infected persons, who then will be placed under different levels of movement and contact restrictions.
According to CNN, if authorities had not proactively sought out people with infection risks, the virus could have quietly spread in communities days before being detected.
For example, in early April, 45,000 people were ordered to quarantine for only 240 infected people.
Whenever a small cluster of infections emerged, the entire village or city was sealed off from the outside world.
As of 18 April 2021, more than 15.7 million people have been placed under quarantine.
Instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted an widespread of public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.
One-party national mechanism and powerful military-security forces helps the government to make decisions quickly and enact them promptly.
Vietnam also has a strong surveillance culture with neighbours who will inform their local police if they suspect any misconduct.
"
This is not an approach that can be taken in Western societies.
"
Experiences with pandemics have led to the longer-term development not only of institutional preparedness but also of "social memory," which has been shown instrumental in nudging people to adopt protective behaviors and heed official regulations and guidance in other COVID-19 response contexts.
Beyond the political factors, social solidarity and unity also played a substantial role.
These sentiments imply an attitude of self-sacrifice on behalf of the broader community, a value that may be explained in part through Vietnam's socialist history and decades-long struggle for sovereignty.
It is important, however, not to allow this grander narrative to minimize the practical individual motivation to keep family, friends, and neighbors safe through social distancing and other measures.
Reports from the media indicate that, in time of severe crisis, people may be willing and prepared to accept more restrictive actions to save lives.
As willingness to embrace social distancing was credited with helping mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Vietnam, examinations of the underlying motivation should acknowledge nationalism and solidarity as important but not sole determinants of effectiveness.
Analysts indicate transparency as the key difference between pandemic management in Vietnam and in the neighboring China, despite their similar communist institutions.
Most international experts present in Vietnam refute skepticism and accord high credibility to statistics provided by the Ministry of Health.
According to Professor Guy Thwaites, the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City had conducted 20,000 separate tests, of which the results matched those publicized by the government.
An investigation by Reuters correspondents in April on 13 funeral organizers in Hanoi found no abnormal upsurge in the number of deaths, if not even a slight decrease due to reduction of traffic accidents during the lockdown.
Huong Le Thu, analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, cites reports of deaths during the second wave as a further demonstration that the zero fatality rate in the previous phase "should have not been questioned in the first place".
Trien Vinh Le and Huy Quynh Nguyen from the University of Economics
Ho Chi Minh City highlight the difference from the censorship policy in China:
As a country with political institutions quite similar to China, Vietnam has long been considered to be a lot more open than China in terms of media censorship and information control.
People in Vietnam, for example, can use most of the world's social networks.
Facebook is especially widely used and serves as a giant platform for people sharing information as well as expressing criticism, directly or indirectly, of government policies.
While China's media was slow to reveal its vulnerabilities and information about the mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan, doubts about the disease statistics from China in the early stages were laid bare to the Vietnamese internet community, enabling a stronger sense of prevention.
Anecdotally, some scholars were seriously criticized when they proposed that face masks were unnecessary and coronavirus was not as dangerous as seasonal influenza in the United States.

Criticism ===


====
Human rights ====
Vietnam also received criticism for its response from anti-communist overseas Vietnamese, who accused the government of not being pro-active enough and censorship.
Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information and political criticism about the government actions on coronavirus pandemic.
From January to March 2020, police censored around 300,000 posts on news sites and blogs and 600,000 posts on social media about COVID-19.
During those two months, police took action against 654 cases of distributing fake news and sanctioned 146 people.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
Michelle Bachelet criticized that Vietnam using laws governing alleged fake news in other contexts to "deter legitimate speech, especially public debate, criticism of government policy and suppress freedom of expression".
She also said: "Arrests for expressing discontent or allegedly spreading false information through the press and social media, have been reported".
====
Personal information ====
The Government has avoided officially publishing unnecessary personal information relating to individuals who are infected or potentially infected with COVID-19.
However, in some cases, individuals diagnosed as having COVID-19 or those in quarantine, were reported to have personal and inaccurate data publicised unofficially on social media sites, including photos and personal ID information.
Such problems deeply impacted the mental health of the affected individuals, including family members, even when they tested negative.
Such situations also risk dissuading persons who may be infected from seeking medical treatment or declaring themselves to health authorities in order to avoid stigma, which in turn would hinder efforts to contain the pandemic.

Economy ===


====
2020 ====
Like most of the world's economy, Vietnam was hit hard by the outbreak because of the slowdown of private and national industries, the downturn of stock exchanges, and the lower number of incoming tourists, making hundreds of thousands people struggling to find jobs and are relying mostly on unemployment benefits to survive.
According to government figures, 3,000 businesses have closed in the first two months of 2020.
However, Vietnam's economic growth is expected to be higher than the Asia average of 2.2%.
Despite the deceleration in economic activity and the downside risks posed by the pandemic, Vietnam's GDP growth rate is still to remain one of the highest in Asia-Pacific Region, according to Asian Development Bank report.
In November the IMF assessed that Vietnam was expected to be the only country in South East Asia that was expected to grow in 2020.Vietnam Industry Agency says industry manufacturing processing is in short supply of raw materials and components (mostly imported from Japan, China, South Korea) leads to the risk of stopping many factory operation.
According to the survey conducted by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and the World Bank with the participation of nearly 10,200 enterprises (nearly 85% from domestic private, the rest are from FDI sector) about the impact of COVID-19.
The survey results showed that the biggest difficulties for businesses during the pandemic are accessing customers, cash flow, labor and supply chain.
At the announcement of the report on the morning of 12 March 2021, Mr. Dau Anh Tuan, Head of the VCCI Legal Department assessed that the pandemic in general had a very negative impact on Vietnam's businesses.
In total, 87.2% of enterprises participated in the survey said that they are negatively affected, 11% are not and only 2% recorded positive growth rates.
Businesses that have been operating for less than 3 years, small and micro-enterprise are struggle the most.
In terms of sectors, private enterprises in some industries have the highest rate of negative impacts are garment (97%), information and communication (96%), and electrical equipment manufacturing (94%).
Some industries have lower rates of impact but still fluctuate around 80% such as real estate and mining.
For the FDI sector, businesses in real estate, information and communication, agriculture and fishery have a large impact, over 95%.

In addition, to withstand the pandemic, 35% of private enterprises and 22% of FDI enterprises have had to lay off their employees.
In which, 36% of small and micro private enterprises, 26% of medium-sized enterprises and 32% of large-scale enterprises implemented this measure.
The Vietnam General Statistics Office said export turnover reached US$99.36 billion, down 1.7% year-on-year.
Meanwhile, import value reached US$97.48 billion, down 3%, Vietnam's exports to the EU and ASEAN fell 12% and 13.4%The International Monetary Fund is projecting Vietnam's economic growth at 2.4% in 2020 at a time when economies of most countries in the world are shrinking.
Vietnam's growth was "among the highest in the world, thanks to its decisive steps to contain the health and economic fallout from COVID-19", IMF mission chief Era Dabla-Norris said.
VCCI emphasized that COVID-19, besides the negative effects, it also offers Vietnam an opportunity to develop the economy when major partner countries such as Japan, the US, the EU, Australia, etc.,
are looking for a place to transfer a part of their supply chain out of China.
With a number of new-generation free trade agreements such as CPTPP and EVFTA, those will help the country to diversify its economic and trade relations, also create favorable conditions for Vietnamese businesses and attract investment to the priority industries and sectors.

==== 2021 ====
In the second half of 2020, the economy was somewhat improved by strictly COVID measures.

But the new outbreak before the Lunar New Year broke this recovery.

Due to the fear of COVID-19 outbreak in Hải Dương and Quảng Ninh in January 2021, the VN-Index plummeted 6.67%, or 73.23 points, to 1,023 points Thursday, the worst single-session loss since September 11 attacks.
The Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE), on which the VN-Index is based, 478 of its tickers lost and only 20 gained.
Out of these, a record 276 tickers hit their floor prices, the lowest they could go in a trading day.
In addition, the VN30-Index for the stock market's 30 largest caps sank 6.73%, with 29 stocks losing and one gaining.
A total 28 stocks in this basket sank to their floor prices.
According to Vietnam's General Statistics Office, the number of employed workers in the first quarter of 2021 decreased by one million people, down to 49,9 million from 50,9 million in the previous quarter.
The country still has 9,1 million workers aged 15 and over that were negatively affected by the pandemic.
Of which more than half a million people lose their jobs, 2,8 million people took unpaid leave
, 3,1 million workers had their working hours cut, and
6,5 million people reporting reduced incomes.
Two-thirds of these people are between the ages of 24 and 54.

COVID-19 impacts have seen as many as 40,300 companies shut down in the first quarter, a year-on-year increase of 16%.

However, the pandemic has changed working habits, promoting the application of information technology of workers to adapt to new normal conditions.
At least 78,000 workers said they have turned to information technology to keep their jobs.
In March 2021, the World Bank published a report that forecast Vietnam to be among the fastest growing economies in the East Asia and Pacific region with a projected growth of 6.6% in 2021.
===
Unemployment ===
According to a report published by the General Statistics Office, as of December 2020, 32.1 million people nationwide have been affected by the pandemic.
Of which, 69.2% of people suffer a decrease in their income, 39.9% have to reduce their working hours and about 14.0% have been laid off.
The labour force in the service sector suffered heaviest losses with 71.6% affected, followed by industry and construction (64.7%) and agriculture, forestry and fishery (26.4%).
The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs said the number of people filing for unemployment in May 2020 surged 44% year-on-year to 157,900.
In the first five months 26,000 companies suspended their business.

In the worst-case scenario, the number of workers affected by the pandemic could rise to 7.2 million in the second quarter, the ministry estimated.
Generally, in 2020, Vietnam's workforce decreased by 1.2 million people to 54.6 million.
In the 2016–2019 period, the labor force increases by 0.8% per year on average.
"
If the workforce in 2020 maintained the same growth rate as in 2016–2019 period and not affected by the pandemic, there would be 1.6 million more workers in the economy.
In other words, COVID-19 could have taken away the chance of these people participating in the labour market.".
The pandemic also changes the seasonal trend of the labour forces between quarters of the year.
In 2016–2019 period, the number of labour forces in the first quarter was always the lowest, then increased gradually in the following quarters and reached the highest level in the fourth quarter.
But in 2020, the number of labour started to decline in the first quarter, then continued to decline sharply and hit the bottom in the second quarter and gradually recovered in the third and fourth quarter. "
Although the economy are recovering but the workforce in the fourth quarter has not yet reached its pre-pandemic state.
The number of labour in fourth quarter was still lower than the first quarter approximately 200,000 people", the General Statistics Office said.

===
Stockpiling ===
Stores across Vietnam quickly sold out of surgical masks and hand sanitisers after the initial cases of coronavirus were reported.
This followed a similar trend in many other Asian countries.
Interim Health Minister
Vũ Đức Đam urged the public to remain calm during the outbreak and avoid excessive emergency shopping.
Vietnamese authorities also arrested people profiteering from the outbreak.

===
Aviation and tourism ===
Tourism is the most severely affected industry in Vietnam.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam said the aviation industry is in the worst situation in the 60 years of its existence.
Of the 234 Vietnam registered aircraft, more than 200 were grounded while airlines still have to spend hundreds of millions dollars to maintain operations such as: aircraft leasing costs, employee salaries, aircraft maintenance and apron parking fees.
Vietnam Airlines estimated that its 2020 revenues could decline by US$2.1 billion.
This has seen as many as 10,000 employees of the national flag carrier, over 50% of its staff strength, taking unpaid leave.
Duong Tri Thanh, CEO of Vietnam Airlines, stressed that the carrier was going through the hardest time in its history.
However, as COVID-19 was brought under control in 2020, it was predicted that Vietnam's aviation will recover faster than other countries in Southeast Asia.
According to a Fitch Ratings forecast, the revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) of Vietnamese airlines would be around 55% of the baseline level in 2020 and will increase to 90% in 2021.According to the General Statistics Office, in August 2020 only over 16,300 foreigners came to Vietnam, mostly experts coming to work.
Since 25 July when the second wave arose, many localities have to closed tourist attractions and deployed measures to curb the spread of infections within the country.
The absence of foreign travellers has dealt a severe blow to the tourism sector.

The ancient imperial city of Huế – which is popular with foreign visitors – resembled a ghost town during the pandemic, with Thừa Thiên Huế province's tourism department saying that 80% of hotels were closed, while 8,000 people had lost their jobs.
In Khánh Hòa Province, where Nha Trang is located, saw the number of tourists fall by over 80% to 1,25 million in 2020.
As a result, hundreds of hotels are being sold for cheap in tourism hotspot Nha Trang.
Authorities have said that the pandemic has caused major difficulties for more than 1,100 accommodation facilities.
Around 100 have suspended operations so far, according to the provincial tourism department.
Revenue from lodging and food & beverage services was US$22.1 billion, down 13%, while revenue from travel agencies' services was US$776 million, a 59.5% drop.
The tourism sector served 3.83 million visitors, against a record 18 million in 2019, with the government closing borders and canceling all international flights.
The fall was seen in almost all major markets, such as China, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and France.
In a recent report by Ho Chi Minh City Department of Tourism, about 90% of travel related businesses in the city had to suspend operations during the second wave.
In 2020, 66 million passengers passed through the country's airports, a 43.5% decrease given the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and unfavorable weather conditions.
Twenty two airports across Vietnam accommodated 340,000 flights operated by 68 foreign and five Vietnamese carriers, down 31.9% from 2019, they also handled nearly 1.3 million tons of cargo, down 14.7% year-on-year, according to a report released by the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV).
National flag carrier Vietnam Airlines and two budget carriers VietJet Air and Bamboo Airways have requested government support and refinancing loans.
They estimated that under current conditions, the industry would only fully recover by 2023 at the earliest.

===
Education ===
On 6 February, under the lead of Phung Xuan Nha, the Minister of Vietnam Education and Training, the Steering Committee for Disease Prevention and Control met and agreed to let the student's stay at home by an additional week after the Tet holiday.
On 14 February, the Ministry of Health reported that schools would remain closed until the end of February, after which schools would close nationwide.
The nationwide school closure decision was issued together with a nationwide quarantine order on 31 March, which went into effect 1 April.
As a matter of fact, Vietnamese students will not to go to school at first semester on 2020–2021 academic year, so schools are slowly adopting online teaching.
On 31 March, the Ministry of Education and Training issued a guide of teaching plans for the second semester of the academic year 2019–2020 for junior high school and high school levels.
The 2020 National High School Graduation Examination (NHSGE) test is only the recognition of the student finishing the high school's education programme instead of "two in one" purpose which is recognition of student finishing the high school's education programme and using high school exams for university admission like before.
The test will divided into two specific phases, first phase take place from 8 to 10 August for the least affected provinces.
The second phase take place on 3 and 4 September at 11 exam councils, with the participation of more than 26,000 students, mostly in the coronavirus epicentre in central Vietnam, along with others quarantined for having close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases.
School closures from February to May impacted an estimated 21.2 million children nationwide and meant the loss of access to key health and protective services as well as subsidized school meals.
COVID-19 also triggered school drop-outs as children accompany parents seeking employment opportunities at new locations.
Approximately 3% of rural households reported they stopped sending children to school due to reduced incomes.
Household registration remains a potential administrative barrier, especially for migrant children, to access the public education system.
Most notably, the COVID-19 crisis exacerbated the country's stark digital divide: many learners live in remote regions with limited internet coverage, cannot afford devices required for online learning or do not have teachers confident to facilitate such learning.
The provision of online and distance learning programmes did not achieve nationwide coverage.
Such learning programmes were available from primary to university levels, however, they primarily focused on grades 9 and 12 in other provinces.
Only large cities had programmes from elementary to high school.
User fees applied for some video lessons.
Online and distance learning focused on few subjects like maths, Vietnamese and English and often not available in ethnic minority languages, while vital extra curriculum programmes such as sex education were often not covered.
Half of a survey's interviewed participants reported their children studied less or not at all while schools were closed.
Many teachers were not well equipped to facilitate online learning, while ethnic minority children and children with disabilities were disproportionately affected.
===
Pharmaceutical ===
Contrary to the pre-pandemic positive forecast, total pharmaceutical revenue in 2020 only increase by less than 3%, compared with an average of nearly 12% each year due to social distancing and tight control of hospital visits.
According to SSI Research, in the ethical drugs market, infection concerns and strict health examination procedures at many hospitals limit the number of patients who come for periodic check-ups causing the number of nationwide medical examination and treatment to decrease 10% to 15%.
While in the over-the-counter drugs market (mainly from drugstores and pharmacies), people switch from buying drugs to hand sanitizers and medical masks, which are not the main product of most pharmaceutical companies in the country, reducing the sales of the whole industry.

However, 2020 was a "significant" year for merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in the pharmaceutical industry.
The total value of M&A in 2020 is estimated at $72.8 million USD, with the participation of many foreign investors.
The biggest deal is SK Group (Korea), which specializes in cancer, nerve and cardiovascular drugs, spent $39.8 million to buy 25% shares of Imexpharm Pharmaceutical Company (IMP).
In addition, Stada Arzneimittel (Germany), specializing in the production of generic drugs, has spent more than $17.3 million raising its ownership in Pymepharco Joint Stock Company from 70% to 76%; while ASKA Pharmaceutical (Japan), specializing in gastrointestinal drugs, hormones and obstetrics and gynecology, spent $16 million to own 25% stake in Hataphar – the second largest drug company in Vietnam in 2019.
These foreign partners all have experience in high-quality drug portfolio that can assist Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies.
The pandemic is a big challenge to the performance of the pharmaceutical industry, especially if the disease spreads in the community.
But in general, spending on health care is essential and the demand only decreased for a short time.
Furthermore, Vietnam's rapidly aging population and increasing per capita income continue to support the long-term growth of the healthcare market, so "the possibility of the industry recovering in 2021 is very likely" SSI's report assessed.

===
Sport ===
The outbreak also forced the 2020 V.League 1 to be delayed to 7 March until further announcement, which affected the preparation of Vietnam national football team for the upcoming 2022 World Cup qualification.
It also caused the Vietnamese Grand Prix of the 2020 Formula One World Championship to be postponed until 2021.On 23 May 2020, 2020 V.League 1 played the first match between CLB Dược Nam Hà Nam Định and CLB Hoàng Anh Gia Lai with 10,000 spectators on Thiên Trường Stadium, this is the first professional football match in the world having spectators since the pandemic breaks.
Due to national travel restrictions, League of Legends esports teams of Vietnam Championship Series could not participate in the 2020 World Championship and 2021 Mid-Season Invitational.

===
In popular culture ===
Vietnam's National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health commissioned artists to release the song "Ghen
Cô Vy" ("Jealous Coronavirus"), a remake of the 2017 song "Ghen" ("Jealous"), to teach people how to thoroughly wash their hands during the worldwide coronavirus outbreak.

Data quality issues ===
Deaths statistics for Italy include coronavirus victims who died in hospital, as well as those who died outside of hospitals and were tested before or after dying.
Post-mortem tests are routinely carried out, and there is no distinction between people who died "with" or "of" coronavirus, including patients with pre-existing conditions, which make up 96% of the total death count.
However, in regions where the healthcare system has been overwhelmed by the pandemic (e.g. Lombardy), official death statistics likely missed a portion of deaths outside hospitals.
In some areas of northern Italy, a comparison of the average registered deaths over the previous years with the deaths in the first months of 2020 showed a sizeable excess of deaths that were not officially included in the coronavirus toll.
In the month of March, 10,900 excess deaths have been estimated, that have not been reported as COVID-19 deaths.
Not all European countries count coronavirus-related deaths with the same criteria.
For instance, in some other European countries, a distinction is made between deaths caused by coronavirus and deaths of people infected with coronavirus, thus often excluding deaths of people with pre-existing conditions.
In addition to this, some countries only report deaths in hospitals.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
It was confirmed to have spread to Indonesia on 2 March 2020, after a dance instructor and her mother tested positive for the virus.
Both were infected from a Japanese national.
By 9 April 2020, the pandemic had spread to all 34 provinces in the country.
Jakarta, West Java, and Central Java are the worst-hit provinces, together accounting more than half of the national total cases.
The largest increase of new cases in a single day occurred on 30 January 2021, when 14,518 cases were announced.
At most 13,038 recoveries and 476 fatalities were ever recorded within a span of 24 hours.
On 13 July 2020, the recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.
As of 29 April 2021, Indonesia has reported 1,662,868 cases, the highest in Southeast Asia, ahead of the Philippines.
With 45,334 deaths, Indonesia ranks third in Asia and 17th in the world.
Review of data, however, indicated that the number of deaths may be much higher than what has been reported as those who died with acute COVID-19 symptoms but had not been confirmed or tested were not counted in the official death figure.
Indonesia has tested 9,769,757 people against its 270 million population so far, or around 36,238 people per million.
The World Health Organization has urged the nation to perform more tests, especially on suspected patients.
Instead of implementing a nationwide lockdown, the government had approved large-scale social restrictions (Indonesian:
Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar, abbreviated as PSBB) for some regencies and cities.
Starting from late May 2020, they began to apply new normal, along with another green and yellow zone regions.
This policy received much criticism and is considered as a 'disaster' due to the still increasing number of cases.
On 13 January 2021, President Joko Widodo was vaccinated at the presidential palace, officially kicking off Indonesia's vaccination program.
As of 
29 April 2021
at 
18:00
WIB (UTC+7), 12,306,015 people had received the first dose of the vaccine, and 7,583,443 people had been fully vaccinated.

Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

==
Timeline ==
From January until February 2020, Indonesia reported zero cases of COVID-19, despite being surrounded by infected countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia.
Flights from countries with high infection rate, including South Korea and Thailand, also continued to operate.
Health experts and researchers at Harvard University in the United States expressed their concerns, saying that Indonesia is ill-prepared for an outbreak and there could be undetected COVID-19 cases.
On 2 March 2020, Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced the first cases in the country: a dance instructor and her mother in Depok, West Java.
Both of them had held a dance class at a restaurant in Kemang, South Jakarta on 14 February, which was attended by more than a dozen people.
One of whom was a Japanese, who was later tested positive for COVID-19 in Malaysia.
As Malaysia reported the case, the government of Indonesia began to trace anyone who have had close contact with the Japanese and the infected Indonesians.
The cluster was initially identified as the "Jakarta cluster" or the "dance class cluster", owing to the location of the infection.
Since then, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia began to increase slowly.
By 8 March, a total of 6 people who had attended the dance class were infected by the COVID-19, including one case of repatriated Indonesian from the Diamond Princess.
Several COVID-19 cases in West Java and Jakarta were found to have a link with the cluster.
The positive cases first confirmed in March are not the first Indonesians to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In January, an Indonesian maid in Singapore contracted the virus from her employer.
The first confirmed death of COVID-19 in the country occurred on 11 March when a 53-year-old British citizen in Bali died.
However, a Telkom employee who died on 3 March was found positive on 14 March.
A newborn baby who died in Manado, North Sulawesi on 19 May was declared as the youngest COVID-19 patient and fatality in Indonesia.
On 11 April, an 11-month-old infant died at Bahteramas Regional General Hospital, Kendari while still under Patient Under Supervision (PDP) status.
On 30 May, a centenarian from Surabaya had recovered, making her the oldest person to recover from COVID-19 in the country.

Classifications ==


===
Cases ===
Since 14 July 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia classifies people involved with COVID-19 into four levels:
A suspect is a person showing symptoms of respiratory infections, and has stayed within 14 days in any country or any region in Indonesia with local transmission and/or has established contact within 14 days with a confirmed or probable case and/or requires treatment at the hospital and has no possible diagnosis of other diseases.

A probable case is a person, alive or deceased, who shows or showed obvious signs of COVID-19 symptoms and awaiting results of his or her swab test.

A confirmed case is a person whose sample produced positive results based on swab or molecular rapid test.
A confirmed case may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.
Due to lower accuracy and higher chance of false positives, a positive rapid or antibody test is not counted into the official number of cases.

A close contact is a person who established contact with a probable or confirmed case between 2 days before and 14 days after symptoms show up, or the date of testing for asymptomatic cases.
He or she must be quarantined for 14 days.
Reclassification into suspect may be done should he or she show symptoms.
Other classifications include:
A recovered case is recorded after a confirmed case is discharged from isolation.
For an asymptomatic case, it is 10 days after a sample testing; for a symptomatic case, it is after a swab test or 10 days after onset of symptoms, and at least 3 days after no fever or respiratory difficulties.

Death is recorded after someone who had been confirmed COVID-19 positive died.
People who were classified into probable case's deaths are not counted in the official tally.

===
Location ===
According to the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, a regency or municipality may be classified into three levels depending on the severity of COVID-19 cases within the region, according to these parameters:
The number of positive cases within 14 days
The number of suspected cases within 14 days
The number of deaths buried according to COVID-19 protocol within 14 days
Threat of disease contagions to healthcare workersEach has a score of 15 points for increasing trends, 20 for stationary trends, and 25 for decreasing trends.

The three levels were assigned to a specific region:
Red Zone if the total score reaches below 80 points.
Large-scale social restrictions may be enforced.

Yellow Zone if the total score reaches 80 to 95 points.

Green Zone
if the total score reaches 100 points (all 4 parameters show a decreasing trend).

Suspected cases ===
Several travellers who had visited or transited through Bali later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 shortly after their return to China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.

This number includes those who had visited Mitra Keluarga Hospital in Depok, the hospital the two confirmed patients were previously admitted to before being transferred to North Jakarta.
A 37-year-old man who died in a hospital in Semarang suspected of having COVID-19 reportedly tested negative, and was instead afflicted by swine flu, probably picked up from recent travels to Spain.

Stimulus policy ====
To reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic to the national economy, the government released a IDR 10.3 trillion stimulus policy to the tourism sector, in the form of ticket price discounts and restaurant tax deductions.

The IDR 10.3 trillion budget is given to provide discounted airplane ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, such as Batam, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Labuan Bajo, Lombok, Malang, Manado, Lake Toba (Silangit Airport), Tanjung Pandan, and Tanjungpinang, which applies from March to May 2020.
Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium-service by 48%, and full-service by 45%.
Specifically for this ticket price discount, the stimulus fund comes from the IDR 444.39 billion state budget (APBN) for a discounted value of 30% and 25% of passengers per flight.
Additionally, there were additional IDR 100 billion ticket discounts paid by Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II and IDR 260 billion PT Pertamina (Persero) paid through jet fuel price discounts, so the total ticket price stimulus was IDR 960 billion, so that the ticket price could be discounted by 50%.The stimulus in the form of restaurant taxes was borne by the central government was also provided to the tune of IDR 3.3 trillion.
Thus, there was no restaurant tax in the ten tourist destinations above, but as compensation, the local government were to be given a grant from the central government.

Travel restrictions ==

Meanwhile, Indonesia AirAsia cancelled all flights.
International airlines have either temporarily suspended services or continue operating with reduced frequency.
Other airlines such as China Airlines and Etihad Airways chose to continue their services as usual.
From 24 April until 8 June, the government suspended all passenger to travel outside areas with at least one confirmed case, regions that had imposed large-scale social restrictions (PSBB), and those that had been declared COVID-19 red zones.
The ban applied to all types of public and private transportation by air, sea, land, and railway, except for vehicles carrying leaders of state institutions, police and military vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks, hearses and vehicles transporting logistical supplies, staple goods and medicines.
Due to its number spike, a total of 59 countries banned non-essential travel to and from Indonesia, among them included Malaysia, Hungary, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and the US as declared by the CDC.
The Indonesian government persuaded other countries to bring Indonesians to their country, but the countries questioned on whether Indonesia is able to manage the outbreak and thus keep them safe.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi telecommunicated with other countries to discuss it; some countries then decided to only unban very essential travel with travellers already conducted two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, in consideration of Indonesia's disrupted economy.
Indonesia imposed a 14-day lockdown from 1 until 14 January 2021 after a new variant of coronavirus was detected in December 2020 and had spread to some countries.
Foreigners worldwide were banned to enter the country's territories.
This was later extended until 22 February.
On 26 March, the national government announced its decision to ban mudik during Eid al-Fitr from 6 to 17 May to curb the spread of COVID-19.
They also tightened the travelling terms and requirements starting from 22 April to 24 May.


==
Criticism ==


=== Failure to detect the virus ===
Health experts were concerned early on that the country was failing to identify the transmission of the virus.
Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, "analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report ... that Indonesia might have missed cases" of coronavirus disease 2019.
Western diplomats as well as local and international news outlets postulated that the lack of cases within Indonesia result from inadequate testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer luck and divine intervention.
On 22 March, a research paper suggested that the official number of infections may only reflect 2% of the real COVID-19 infections in Indonesia.
According to The Jakarta Post on 5 April 2020, the central government has only conducted a daily average of 240 PCR tests since 2 March.

===
Budget for foreign social media influencers ===
The government was criticized after pledging to set aside IDR 72 billion ($5m) to pay for social media influencers to attract tourists to Indonesia.

===
Lack of transparency ===
President Jokowi was also criticized in March 2020 by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, human rights groups, and also by political parties such as Golkar and PKS for lack of transparency regarding information on COVID-19.
Widodo insisted on not sharing travel history details of the patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the general public.
The public had asked the government to release official national map of COVID-19 confirmed cases' location, as unofficial independent maps may provide incorrect data.

===
Tests and treatment ===
Reports surfaced about patients in Greater Jakarta having to wait for a long time to get tests or treatment for possible cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as referral hospitals face the increasing strain.

===
Lockdown policies ===
President Jokowi came in the course of March under increased pressure to impose a partial lockdown on virus-plagued areas, with scientists saying the country is racing against time to curb the spread of COVID-19 before Eid al-Fitr and that a community quarantine could be the only solution to do exactly that.
On 16 March, Jokowi said lockdown policies are the authority of the central government, and warned the local government to not impose lockdown without the consent of the central authority.
On 27 March, dozens of Indonesian medical professors called for "local lockdowns", saying that the government's policy of physical distancing is not "effective".
The government is drafting a regulation (PP) to stipulate the procedures and requirements for imposing regional quarantines.

===
Censorship ===
Some critics of the government were arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic.
===
Additional death rates excluded from official counts ===
According to a report from Reuters, as of 28 April 2020, there were around 2,200 patients who had died with coronavirus symptoms, but not included into the official death toll of 693.
This suggests that Indonesia has a higher death rate than the official counts.
An analysis by Financial Times showed that there were 1,400 more deaths in Jakarta compared to the historical average number of deaths in March and April.
This excess deaths figure is 15 times the official figure of 90 COVID-19 deaths in this same period.

=== Evasion of travel restrictions ===
"Ramadan exodus" contributed to the spread of the virus in Indonesia, despite government regulations on social distancing and despite a lockdown slated to run until June.
Also, despite the travel restrictions which suspended all passengers to travel outside areas with at least one confirmed case, many Indonesians disregarded it and have attempted to evade the travel restrictions in order to return to hometown during Eid al-Fitr season.
This caused scientists to raise concern that this evasion would lead to the diseases which can spread easily from Jakarta and nearby satellite cities, where it is the epicenter of the pandemic, to other regions of Indonesia with weak medical facilities which were arguably unable to handle large numbers of outbreak.
There were also a few attempts to evade the travel restrictions which were discovered by the police department, such as one of the cargo trucks which was stopped, in which an intermodal container was hiding a car with passengers inside, to be transported from Java to Sumatra.
An additional four cargo trucks were also detained when the driver attempting to bring 20 passengers from Jakarta inside the containers which were covered with tarpaulin.

===
Lack of safety in tobacco industries ===
Despite the temporary closure of HM Sampoerna due to two workers dying from COVID-19, with additional 63 workers tested positive, Pandu Riono, the epidemiologist from University of Indonesia reported that other cigarette factories in East and West Java will continue to operate without practicing social distancing and workers never wearing face masks.
This sparks concern that the cigarette factories could create new clusters for the coronavirus outbreak considering that this industry usually has large workforce.

==
Impact ==


===
Socioeconomic ===
In the first weeks of the pandemic, surgical face masks in Indonesia soared in price by over six times the original retail value from around IDR 30,000 to IDR 185,000 (some sources said it exceeded IDR 300,000) per box in some outlets after the announcement that two citizens had tested positive for coronavirus.
Panic buying was reported since mid-February before the first cases were confirmed.
There were also shortages of thermometers, antiseptics and hand sanitizers.
President Jokowi condemned the hoarding of face masks and hand sanitizers and police started to crack down on suspected hoarders.

Census ====


===
Economic ===
Following the worldwide trend of stock price drops, the IDX Composite weakened even before the first confirmation of the disease in Indonesia.
In response to expected economic slowdown due to the loss of Chinese economic activity, Bank Indonesia cut its interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.75% on 20 February.
On 12 March, as WHO declared pandemic, IDX Composite tumbled 4.2% to 4,937 when Thursday's session was opened, a level unseen in almost four years.
On 13 March, equity trading halted for the first time since 2008 over pandemic.

On 17 March, Rupiah weakened to IDR 15,000 per dollar, touching a level unseen since October 2018.On 19 March, IDX Composite halted because of the sharp downturn of more than 5%.
This is the fourth trading halt that IDX Composite experienced during the coronavirus crisis.
Indonesia Financial Service Authority or OJK have mandated a suspension of trading if IDX Composite fell down more than 15%.Numbers of shopping malls started to voluntarily close due to declining foot traffic; only pharmacies, groceries and ATM still operate with limited hours.
Indonesian Finance Minister predicted that Indonesian economic growth Q2 can drop to 0.% or even minus 2.6%, but in Q3 can recover to 1.5 to 2.8%.Indonesia's economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 stood at 2.97%, but it is the weakest economic growth recorded since 2001.
The second-quarter contraction was recorded to be 5.32%, exceeding both government and economists' predictions.
Though many economists, such as Brian Tan at Barclays, Radhika Rao at DBS and Helmi Arman at Citi still expect the economy to contract in 2020.
It was estimated in August that as many as 3.7 million Indonesians may have lost their jobs.
The contraction was the steepest economic drop Indonesia has experienced since the Asian financial crisis.
Brian Tan, Barclays Investment Bank's regional economist, noted that private consumption, government consumption and fixed investment all fell in Q2 as social distancing measures under Indonesia's large-scale social restriction measures, or Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar (PSBB), have stifled economic activity.
This led to a collapse in imports, which outpaced the decline in exports, he said in a report.

Barclays thus slashed its 2020 GDP forecast further to a 1.3% contraction, down from 1% contraction, Mr Tan said, which is below the central bank's earlier GDP growth forecast range of 0.9 to 1.9%.
===
Sports, tourism, and leisure ===
Indonesian tourism has been severely affected.
In March, overall tourist numbers fell by 64%, and Chinese tourists by 97%.
Bali, where tourism accounts for 60% of GRP, had witnessed its foreign tourist arrivals fell by 93.2% in April.
Hotels were taking on a meager occupancy rate, with some hotels experiencing 5% and even 0% occupancy rate due to overspecialization on Chinese visitors, increasing travel restrictions from source countries, and an overall fear of the virus.
There was, however, an increase in interest for domestic tourism, and Chinese tourists which had already been on the island generally opted to extend their stay.
All beaches in Bali were temporarily closed for the public.
The 2020 edition of the National Sports Week (PON) in Papua, which was initially slated for October, has been postponed until next year.
Jakarta ePrix race of the 2019–20
Formula E season would also be postponed due to coronavirus concerns, then later cancelled after the rescheduling calendar involving Berlin ePrix for the season-ending triple header.
The city's Capital Investment and One-Stop Service (PM-PTSP) announced it plans to postpone any public events with mass-gatherings from March to April following the news of an increasing number of COVID-19 cases to 27.Numerous music events such as by Rich Brian, Hammersonic Festival, Dream Theater, Babymetal, Slipknot, ONE OK ROCK, and electronic dance music festival
"We Are Connected" have been suspended in the country.

Several local films, such as KKN di Desa Penari, Tersanjung The Movie, and Generasi
90-an:
Melankolia, have been delayed, also because of the pandemic.
The 2020 Indonesia International Motor Show was postponed due to the pandemic, then later cancelled.
The 2020 edition of both the Indonesia Open and Indonesia Masters Super 100 were cancelled due to the pandemic.
Starting on 19 December 2020, Bali required its domestic visitors who would travel by air during the Christmas and New Year holiday to perform a PCR test, or an antigen test if they are entering by land or sea.
Due to the sudden regulation, 133,000 would-be visitors asked for plane ticket refund, with losses estimated at around 317 billion IDR.The 2021 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which would have been hosted in Indonesia on 20 May-12 June 2021, was cancelled by FIFA on December 24.

Risk Factors
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as the coronavirus or COVID, is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.
Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.
At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.
Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).
Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms.
Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.
Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.
Small droplets containing the virus can spread from an infected person's nose and mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak.
Other people are infected if the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes.
Airborne transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller infected droplets and particles can linger in the air for minutes to hours within enclosed spaces that have inadequate ventilation.
Less commonly, the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces.
People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.
People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.
Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease.
The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.
The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.
Several vaccines have been developed and many countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.

Although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic.
Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

==
Name ==
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".
In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.
Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).
The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.

==
Signs and symptoms ==


==
Cause ==
COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) virus strain.

===
Transmission ===


===
Virology ===
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S).
The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.
The structure of the M protein resembles the sugar transporter
SemiSWEET.The
many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into clades.
Several different clade nomenclatures have been proposed.
Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven
(L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2020.
Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.
After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, it is believed to have been eradicated.
The Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC 202012/01) is believed to have emerged in the United Kingdom in September.
The 501Y.V2 Variant, which has the same N501Y mutation, arose independently in South Africa.

===
SARS-CoV-2 variants ===
Three known variants of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading among global populations As of January 2021, including the UK Variant (referred to as B.1.1.7) first found in London and Kent, a variant discovered in South Africa (referred to as 1.351), and a variant discovered in Brazil (referred to as P.1).Using whole genome sequencing, epidemiology and modelling suggest the new UK variant VUI-202012/01 (the first variant under investigation in December 2020) transmits more easily than other strains.

==
Pathophysiology ==
COVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective, though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II
receptor blocker medications could be protective.
As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown however it is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues.
The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 people with neurological issues.
However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID-19, but these results need to be confirmed.
Loss of smell results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons.
SARS-CoV-2 could cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS.
While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.
The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.

The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.
An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found people transferred to Intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.
Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.
Furthermore, microvascular blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brains – without detected SARS-CoV-2 – and
the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID-19.Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.
Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.
Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.

===
Immunopathology ===
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL‑2, IL‑7, IL‑6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM‑CSF), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP‑10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein
1‑alpha (MIP‑1‑alpha), and tumour necrosis factor
(TNF‑α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.
Additionally, people with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.
Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.

===
Viral and host factors ===


====
Virus proteins ====
Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus.
The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors.
It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.
S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain.
S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2, which are heptad repeat regions.
Studies have shown that S1 domain induced IgG and IgA antibody levels at a much higher capacity.
It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients.
It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope.
The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response.

====
Host factors ====
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID-19.
Theoretically the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID-19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB.
However no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes.
Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.
The virus's effect on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants.
These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms.
However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

===
Host cytokine response ===
The severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm.
Levels of interleukin 1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity.
Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease.
A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality.
The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis.
The production of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses, inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm.
The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon.
Pregnancy response
Nowadays, there are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.
Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:

Immunological:
The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system.
It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the fetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy.

Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections.
One of them is the total reduction of the lungs' capacity and inability to clear secretions.

Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be implicated.
The thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women.
However, from the current evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus.
In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways.
On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation.
On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy.
Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life.

==
Diagnosis ==
COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.
Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.
Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.

===
Viral testing ===
The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.
As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.
"
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within hours.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.
Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing" On 7 September, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results".
===
Imaging ===
Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.
Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.
===
Coding ===
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

===
Pathology ===
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:

Macroscopy: pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Lung findings:
minor serous exudation, minor fibrin exudation
pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.

organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
plasmocytosis in BAL
Blood and vessels: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction, endotheliitis, hemophagocytosis
Heart:
cardiac muscle cell necrosis
Liver:
microvesicular steatosis
Nose:
shedding of olfactory epithelium
Brain:
infarction
Kidneys: acute tubular damage.

Spleen:
white pulp depletion.
==
Prevention ==
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Poor hygienic conditions in underdeveloped countries such as the Dominican Republic, where there is also a gender, class, and ethnic gap, complicate the whole process of COVID-19 prevention.
Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.
The first COVID-19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December by the UK medicines regulator MHRA.
It was evaluated for emergency use authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other countries.
Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID-19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.
Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".
This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.
===
Vaccine ===


===
Social distancing ===
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.
Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.
In the United States, the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.

===
Self-isolation ===
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.
Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.

===
Face masks and respiratory hygiene ===
The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.
Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.
A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection.
But, if the mask include an exhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the virus outwards through it, despite any certification they can have.
So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers, and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale.
Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.
When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.
Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID-19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.

=== Ventilation and air filtration ===
The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.

===
Healthy diet and lifestyle ===
The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recommends a healthy diet, being physically active, managing psychological stress, and getting enough sleep.
There is no good evidence that vitamin D status has any relationship with COVID-19 health outcomes.

=== Hand-washing and hygiene ===
Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.
The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.
However, despite the measures recommended by the WHO, not all households have access to some necessities.
In the Dominican Republic, 46% of households do not have access to safe drinking water.
Only 44.9% receive drinking water at home every two to three days.
When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol.
For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis.
"
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
===
Surface cleaning ===
After being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection.
Current evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID-19, leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.
Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticized as hygiene theater, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.
The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity.
Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight.
Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%).On many surfaces, including as glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions.
On some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, the virus usually dies after a few hours.
As a rule of thumb, the virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces.
However, this rule is not absolute, and of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are N95 respirator masks and surgical masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces.
The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergant, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used.
A datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inocuylum volumes) can be seen in the supplementary material of.
==
Treatment ==
== Prognosis ==
The severity of COVID-19 varies.
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization.
Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.
The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised.
However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.
Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU.Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.
A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.
On 30 October 2020 WHO
chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects."
He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning".
They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects.
Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body.
Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms.
Tedros has concluded that therefore herd immunity is "morally unconscionable and unfeasible".
In terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge.
The average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit.
There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility.
Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.
According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers, air pollution is similarly associated with risk factors, and pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity contributes to an increased health risk of COVID-19.It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2.
One research that looked into the COVID-19 infections in hospitalized kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease.
For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID-19.
Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, like SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.

===
Children ===
While very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole.
Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults.
The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalized children were admitted to the ICU, while a European multinational study of hospitalized children from June 2020 found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care.
Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate could be "substantially lower" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.

===
Complications ===
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.
Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.
Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.
Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).
Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.
In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have an altered mental status.
In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.

This is because pregnant women with COVID-19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction.

Longer-term effects ===
Some early studies suggest that that ten to twenty percent of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.
A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.
About 5-10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.
By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID-19.
The majority of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities in people tested after 28 days of illness.
People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis.
Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time.

===
Immunity ===
The immune response by humans to CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections.
Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.
The presence of neutralizing antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralizing antibody declines with time.
Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection.
In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms.
However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2.
Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms.
Nevertheless, 15 cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported using stringent CDC criteria requiring identification of a different variant from the second infection.
There are likely to be many more people who have been reinfected with the virus.
Herd immunity will not eliminate the virus if reinfection is common.
Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.
Nonetheless, on 3 March 2021, scientists reported that a much more contagious COVID-19 variant, Lineage P.1, first detected in Japan, and subsequently found in Brazil, as well as in several places in the United States, may be associated with COVID-19 disease reinfection after recovery from an earlier COVID-19 infection.

== Mortality ==
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
Data has changed throughout the course of the pandemic, as much within as between countries.
However, what has remained constant is the prevalence of women affected by Covid in contrast to men, although the fatalities have not been as high as theirs.
This was especially so at the beginning of the pandemic.
This might be due to the fact that both professional and home care affairs have been an area relegated to women in history.
These are obviously closer to the virus than other areas of work.
Regarding age and sex, in India, for instance, COVID-19 cases between men and women did not represent a uniform ratio among different age groups.
Mortality rates were higher in women, especially in the 40-49 year age group.
The socioeconomic status can also affect the number of people affected by COVID-19.
We do not own precise data about this factor, but in other national contexts it has been found that marginalised groups are at higher risk of infection and death.
The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group.
Consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population.
Mortality rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.
In fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries’ populations.
For example, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower in India than in the US since India’s younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US.The case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.1% (3,153,526/149,744,454) as of 29 April 2021.
The number varies by region.
The CFR may not reflect the true severity of the disease, because some infected individuals remain asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms, and hence such infections may not be included in official case reports.
Moreover, the CFR may vary markedly over time and across locations due to the availability of live virus tests.

===
Infection fatality rate ===
A key metric in gauging the severity of COVID-19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk.
This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.

====
Current estimates ====
A December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy.
That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85.
These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO.
====
Earlier estimates of IFR ====
At an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.
On 2 July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.
In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.
Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate.
As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID-19 (0.3% of the population).
Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%, and ~1.4%.
In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died.
In September 2020 the U.S. Center for Disease Control & Prevention reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes.

===
Sex differences ===
Early reviews of epidemiologic data showed gendered impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in China and Italy.
According to global data, COVID-19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries.
However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men.
This might be due to the fact that both professional and home care affairs have been an area relegated to women in history.
These are obviously closer to the virus than other areas of work.
For example, in Spain since the sanitary crisis began, healthcare workers have been more affected than anyone else.
Almost 50,000 of them have been affected, of whom a 66% are women.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.
One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.
Smoking, which in some countries like China is mainly a male activity, is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men.
Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.
The fact that women boast a longer life expectancy than men also makes a bigger group of female population at risk of contracting the disease.
Not only that, it also creates an ageist dynamic that can end up in discrimination for being both a woman and old.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The WHO issued a report in 2007 that showed that more than half the SARS cases at the beginning of 2000 were women.
Regarding the spread of information about COVID-19, many researchers and experts agreed that data on COVID-19 infection should be sex-disaggregated.
This would allow researchers to develop solutions to the pandemic from a gender-equitable perspective, given sex differences in fatality rates.
Also, this would allow experts to deliver high-quality data separately to men and women.

===
Ethnic differences ===
In the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups.
Structural factors that prevent them from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in "essential" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff.
Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death.
Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities.
On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality.
In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent.
According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.
The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.
Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.
In the U.K., a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred in those of a Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority background.
More severe impacts upon victims including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalization requirements, and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage.
That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease.
The findings are from Professor Svante Pääbo and researchers he leads at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Karolinska Institutet.
This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago in Southern Europe.

===
Comorbidities ===
Biological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID-19.
Most of those who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.
The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases.
According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), Ischemic Heart Disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).

Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the CDC, are: moderate or severe asthma, pre-existing COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis.
Evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes.
When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID-19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.
COVID-19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.
In August 2020 the CDC issued a caution that tuberculosis (TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death.
The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID-19 could not rule out co-infections.
Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3 million additional TB cases and 1.4 million TB-related deaths by 2025.

==
History ==
The virus is thought to be natural and of an animal origin, through spillover infection.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.
Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019.
Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host.
The first known human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.
According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.
In May 2020 George Gao, the director of the CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak.
Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019.By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December.
On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.
On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.
A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause" that same evening.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January), were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases – enough to trigger an investigation.
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected.
A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".
On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.
Italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 January 2020, two tourists from China.
As of 13 March 2020
the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.
Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths on 19 March 2020 .
By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.
Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.
Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019, and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected.
A September 2020 review journal article said, "The possibility that the COVID-19 infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence," including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December.

==
Misinformation ==
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.
In September 2020, the U.S. CDC published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood.

==
Other animals ==
Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis.

Some pets, especially cats and ferrets, can catch this virus from infected humans.
Symptoms in cats include respiratory (such as a cough) and digestive symptoms.
Cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been proven.
Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection.
Behaviors which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal.
The virus does not appear to be able to infect pigs, ducks, or chickens at all.
Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus.
Tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans.
As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
Minks, which are in the same family as ferrets, have been infected.
Minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the virus to humans.
Multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms.
Denmark, a major producer of mink pelts, ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations.
A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched.

==
Research ==
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory.
There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.
As of December 2020, hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica.
As of November 2020, more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far.
=== Transmission and prevention research ===
Modelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, diagnosis and prognosis of infection, estimation of the impact of interventions, or allocation of resources.
Modelling studies are mostly based on epidemiological models, estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions.
Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID-19, retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure, mobility-data based models to investigate transmission, or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.
Further, conceptual frameworks from crisis management research have been applied to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on organizations worldwide.

===
Treatment-related research ===
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID-19 treatments.
Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme
2.In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Solidarity trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: an experimental drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and interferon-beta.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine
showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.
By May 2020, France, Italy, and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment.
In June, initial results from the randomised RECOVERY Trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.
Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids.
Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.
In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19.
The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID-19
(strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).
The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID-19
(conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).
The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of
critically ill COVID-19 patients.
In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.
Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.
In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
Bamlanivimab is authorized for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 or hospitalization.
This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions.
In February 2021, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) who test positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19.
The authorized use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.
In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and certain pediatric patients.

====
Cytokine storm ====
A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly; A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID-19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses; These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm.
Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a Phase II non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA to undergo a Phase III clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID-19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS.
Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across the blood-brain barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of CRS.Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

====
Passive antibodies ====
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.
As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies.
It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID-19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID-19 is also being studied.
This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to current patients.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
A Cochrane review in October 2020, found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this treatment in COVID-19, due in large part to the methodology of the clinical trials conducted so far.
Specifically, there are no trials yet conducted for which the safety of convalescent serum administration to people with COVID-19 can be determined, and the differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.

==
Effect on other diseases and the pharmacy trade ==
There was a report on 3 March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID-19 caused such a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu that in Britain the sale of cough liquids and throat lozenges and decongestants from 30 November 2020 to 21 February 2021, was about a half of the sale a year earlier, and that Public Health England reported no cases of flu in the year 2021 to date, and that there was an 89% rise in sales of Vitamin D to try to boost immunity.

January 2021 ==
=
1 January – The UK government announces that all primary schools in London will remain closed for the start of the winter term.

2 January –
Teaching unions have told primary school staff it is unsafe to return to school and urged them to implement remote learning as pressure grows on the government to keep schools closed for the first two weeks of January following its decision to do so in London.

An anti-lockdown protest is held in Hyde Park in London; 17 people are arrested at the demonstration.

Police chiefs have called for police officers to be given priority for COVID vaccinations after reports that 1,300 Metropolitan Police officers are absent from work because of the virus.

3 January –
Following concerns about the safety of reopening schools, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged parents of primary age children to send them to school the following day if their school is open, saying there is "no doubt in my mind that schools are safe".
Despite this, many primary schools have still decided to not open after the Christmas break.
So far Essex Council has said that would keep schools closed at least until 6 January; Kent county Council along with Birmingham's education authorities asked the `Education Secretary to allow primaries to stay closed.
They said the argument for reopening amid high infection rates “does not stack up”.

Johnson has also stated that tougher restrictions are "probably about to get tougher" in some parts of England as COVID-19 cases continue to increase.

Leader of the Opposition
Sir Keir Starmer calls for a national lockdown to be announced within 24 hours in order to tackle the rising number of COVID cases.

Wendy Simon, the Acting Mayor of Liverpool, and other Liverpool City Council members, have called for England to go into a national lockdown in order to curb rising COVID cases in the city.

Garrett Emmerson, the Chief Executive of the London Ambulance Service, describes the service as being under "incredible pressure" but "coping".

Paediatricians have sought to reassure parents that the new strain of COVID is not more dangerous to children after a nurse based at a London hospital told the BBC that her hospital had "a while ward of children" suffering with the virus.

4 January
Most of England's primary schools are reopened, amid concerns over whether pupils should be returning under the current COVID restrictions.

After saying there is "no question" that tougher COVID measures will be introduced "in due course", Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a televised address in which he announces another lockdown for England, with rules similar to those in March 2020.

===
Cases ===


====
Cumulative cases ====
The numbers of cases in the tables below referred to the number of cases at the end of each day (23:59 AEDT) until 4 April 2020.
Since 5 April 2020, the federal government standardised the daily case
number release time to 15:00 AEST which has been reflected in the data.
This data has been compiled by recording the daily values from the infographic available under "Current Status" on the Australian Government's Department of Health website.
Under National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System reporting requirements, cases are reported based on their Australian jurisdiction of residence rather than where they were detected.

The following charts represent changes in net number of cases on a daily basis and is based on the number of cases reported in the Federal Government's daily reports.

====
Active cases ====
As of 29 April 2021, there are 276 active cases of COVID-19 in Australia.
A case is considered active if a person who was COVID-19 positive but has yet to be classified as recovered and has not died.
The chart below tracks active cases since 5 April, when the Federal Government began reporting nationwide recovery data.
However, since 20 July, the Federal Government began reporting official estimation of nationwide active cases and has been reflected in the chart.

===
Deaths ===
As of 29 April 2021, 910 people linked to COVID-19 have died in Australia.
At least 685 deaths were residents in aged care facilities, and at least 29 deaths had been passengers or crew on cruise ships.
===
Clusters ===
COVID-19 clusters are cases that are known to be related by close contacts.
A single cluster may have cases in multiple locations.
Some smaller clusters are known to be linked to larger clusters.
A cluster may be investigated for days before being announced for the first time.
The Victorian Government did not report breakdowns of individual clusters on 10 July due to widespread community transmission becoming entrenched in the metropolitan area.
On 8 September, the Victoria Government published numbers relating to all aged care clusters.
The worst nursing home cluster in Australia was at St Basil's Homes for the Aged in Victoria, where 45 residents died.

===
Cases by source of infection ===
The following table lists the cases by their source of infection per state/territory.
High numbers of cases with unknown sources of infection indicates high risk of community transmission and increased difficulty in tracing and stopping the spread of COVID-19.
There have been estimated to be around 1,300 cases that have been associated with cruise ships in Australia.

===
Cases and deaths by age group and gender ===
The following table represents the number of cases and deaths for each age group and gender.
The data is sourced from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and the Federal Government.

Information from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Health
The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020, when a man from São Paulo tested positive for the virus.
The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by 21 March.
On 19 June 2020, the country reported its 1 millionth case; at this time, there had been nearly 49,000 reported deaths.
As of April, Brazil, with over 14 million confirmed cases and over 390,000 deaths, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only the United States and India.

The pandemic has triggered a variety of responses from federal, state and local governments, having an impact on politics, education, the environment, and the economy.
On 27 March 2020 Brazil announced a temporary ban on foreign air travelers and most state governors have imposed quarantines to prevent the spread of the virus.

==== November ====
27 November
: Two raw sewage samples collected independently on 27 November 2019 in Santa Catarina, Brazil, will later detect SARS-CoV-2 (100,000 copies per litre), 66 days in advance of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the Americas.
Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020.
These samples can show that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in Brazil at least as early as late November 2019.

=== 2020 ===
On 28 January 2020, Brazil's Ministry of Health announced that a suspected case of COVID-19 was being investigated in Belo Horizonte, involving a student who had recently returned from Wuhan, China.

On 3 February, it was announced that the Brazilian government would assist in helping citizens in Wuhan return to the country; on 5 February, two planes were sent to Wuhan to repatriate 34 citizens.
The citizens and all other crew were to be quarantined and monitored for 18 days at a Brazilian Air Force base in Anápolis.
They were released ahead of schedule on 23 February, after repeatedly testing negative.
On 25 February, the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Brazil (and the first in South America) was announced by the Health Department of São Paulo — a 61-year-old man who had returned from Lombardy, Italy.
A second case was confirmed soon after in another person who had recently returned from Italy.
On 28 February, scientists of the University of São Paulo's Tropical Medicine Institute and the Adolfo Lutz Institute reported that they had sequenced the genomes of these two cases, which had been separately introduced from Northern Italy to Brazil on two occasions.
In an address on 6 March, President Jair Bolsonaro advised residents to "strictly follow the experts' recommendations as the best protective measure", but that "there is no reason to panic".

On 12 March, it was reported that Bolsonaro's press secretary Fábio Wajngarten had tested positive for COVID-19, prompting increased monitoring of Bolsonaro (who tested negative the next day) and his cabinet.
Wajngarten had also interacted with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence during Bolsonaro's visit to Miami, Florida on 7 March.
The number of cases within the cabinet began to increase, including Minister of Mines and Energy Bento Albuquerque, and President of the Federal Senate Davi Alcolumbre; by 20 March, Brazil had the second-largest number of cases among members of a federal cabinet, overtaking Iran and behind only France.
On 13 March, the cruise ship Silver Shadow arrived from the Bahamas and docked in Recife, Pernambuco, bearing 318 passengers and 291 crew members, including one suspected case of COVID-19.

13 January
: Researchers from Fiocruz Amazônia announce the discovery of a variant of strain B.1.1.28 in Manaus, being called P.1.
According to Felipe Naveca, a scientist at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, there is no doubt that the variant appeared in the Amazon, and may be more contagious.
In the view of the researcher Jesem Orellana, from Fiocruz-Alazonia, "the new variant is the "most plausible explanation" for the recent explosion of cases".

Scientific research and forecast ===
On 19 March 2020, scientists predicted up to 2 million deaths in Brazil in the worst-case scenario without measures to contain the virus.
They pointed out that a policy of social distancing was one of the most effective measures given the lack of a vaccine.
On 20 March, experts from Italy warned that the coronavirus growth curve in Brazil would repeat that of European countries.
An observatory with physicists from USP, University of Campinas, São Paulo State University, University of Brasília, Federal University of ABC, UC Berkeley and the University of Oldenburg showed that the number of infected people, considering data from 19 March, had been doubling every 54 hours, and that the case total would exceed 3,000 by the 24th.
On 21 March, researchers began to mobilize to increase the availability of testing in Brazil.
The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro was attempting to create a serology test, as opposed to the more common PCR test, to detect infections through a patient's blood samples.

Minister of Health Luiz Henrique Mandetta said that the number of cases would increase exponentially until the end of June.
On 23 March, a report from FGV economist Emerson Marçal predicted a negative 2020 GDP of up to 4.4% due to the effect of the coronavirus.
Eleven
COVID-19 patients died after receiving high doses of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine in a study in Brazil.
This was reported in mid-April.
The study was halted.
On 15 August 2020, three joint-ventures began testing a new COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil.
The origin of the research and development became a hugely debated issue, further complicated by conspiracy theories spread by anti-vax groups and renowned political allies of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazilian President along with xenophobia.

===
Preventive measures ===
On 13 March, the Ministry of Health recommended that those travelling to Brazil self-isolate for at least 7 days on arrival.

On 17 March, Brazilian authorities partially closed their border with Venezuela.
Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta had urged closure of the border due to Venezuela's collapsing health system.
The state of Santa Catarina declared a state of emergency, and ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses, and suspended public transit, inter-city and inter-state buses, public meetings, concerts, theatres, sporting events and religious services.
On 18 March, Rio de Janeiro and five other municipalities—São Gonçalo, Guapimirim, Niterói, Nova Iguaçu, and Mesquita—in the state of Rio de Janeiro had declared a state of emergency to help contain the coronavirus.
The following day, the government of Rio Grande do Sul declared a public emergency situation.
Among the measures adopted were the prohibition of interstate travel and the restriction of items purchased in the markets.
On 20 March, the government of Rio Grande do Norte declared a public emergency situation.
On 21 March, cases in São Paulo rose almost 40% in two hours.

On 9 May, the government of Rio Grande do Sul established a new social distancing plan.
Given that some areas were more affected than others, the local government organized the state in 20 sectors.
Each sector is ranked – according to the number of cases, hospital occupancy rates, and other factors – from Yellow (low risk), to Orange, Red, and Black (high risk).
The goal of this scale is to be able to respond better to the current pandemic, and allow the population on lower risk areas to return to a somewhat normal life.

===
Presidential responses ===
Despite the global impact of COVID-19 and repeated warnings from health experts and organisations, President Bolsonaro has routinely downplayed its severity.
He has described the threat of COVID-19 as being exaggerated, and as being a "fantasy" created by the media.
On 15 March, Bolsonaro made an appearance during a pro-government rally in Brasília, interacting with his supporters; the President faced criticism for his participation without taking precautions (such as wearing a mask), as it came on the heels of his press secretary being infected following his presidential visit to the United States.
Later that day, Bolsonaro claimed that businesses were profiting off "hysteria", and he said the public should not react with "neurosis.
"He has opposed proposals to suspend interstate travel between states with cases, and the closure of businesses (including malls and weekly outdoor markets), arguing in the case of the latter that they were "extreme measures" that would hurt the economy.
Governor of São Paulo João Doria criticised President Bolsonaro for his inaction on COVID-19, which had required individual states to take on responsibilities that should have been taken on at the federal level.
Subsequently, on 22 March, Doria told CNN that Bolsonaro was "an unprepared and psychopathic leader.
"
In mid-March, panelaços began to occur in major cities such as Rio and São Paulo, including protests in support of the president, and others calling for his resignation.
According to one poll, 64% of Brazilians rejected the way Bolsonaro had been handling the pandemic, while 44.8% supported his impeachment, an all-time high.

According to some sources in Congress, Bolsonaro was shutting down political dialogue on purpose.
They claim he was forcing his impeachment as a way to mobilize his supporters.
On 19 March, President Bolsonaro's son Eduardo shared a Twitter post that which blamed the Chinese Communist Party for the worldwide spread of COVID-19.
As China is Brazil's largest trading partner, the post provoked criticism from Chinese diplomats such as Yang Wanming — who argued that Bolsonaro family was "the great poison of this country.
"On
21 March, it was reported that Alcolumbre, president of the Chamber of Deputies Rodrigo Maia, and the leaders of the major parties in the National Congress, no longer believed that they could conduct productive dialogue on COVID-19 with Bolsonaro.
In a televised interview on 23 March, Bolsonaro criticised the protests against him, arguing that "the people will soon see that they were tricked by these governors and by the large part of the media when it comes to coronavirus".
He described COVID-19 as being merely a "little flu".
In a presidential address the next day, Bolsonaro continued with these arguments, criticising the use of "scorched earth" mitigation measures such as closing businesses and restricting travel, questioning the closure of schools due to there being more infections among the elderly, and accusing the media of spreading a "feeling of dread" among the population.
He argued that the lives of Brazilians needed to return to normality, and that "because of my background as an athlete, I wouldn’t need to worry if I was infected by the virus.
I wouldn’t feel anything or at the very worst it would be like a little flu or a bit of a cold.
"The
address was met with a negative response by many Brazilian politicians, as well as critics of Bolsonaro; in a Twitter post, journalist Ricardo Noblat referred to it as the "first political suicide broadcast live on national radio and television."
The ongoing public protests against the President intensified during and after the address.
In a press briefing on 27 March, Bolsonaro continued to downplay the possibility that COVID-19 could spread rapidly nationwide, arguing that Brazilians "never catch anything", and that there was a possibility that portions of the population were already immune.
In late-March, Facebook, Inc.
and Twitter pulled social media posts by Bolsonaro that promoted hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment for COVID-19, with the companies considering them misinformation that could cause physical harm, and a contradiction of authoritative health information respectively.
Twitter also pulled a similar post by Bolsonaro that called for the reopening of the economy.
On 28 April, when a reporter pointed out that Brazil's death toll had surpassed China's, he replied, "So what?
I'm sorry, but
what do you want me to do?"On 7 July, after announcing that he had tested positive, Bolsonaro remarked "There’s no reason for fear.
That's life", and continued to criticise lockdown measures, arguing that "the majority of Brazilians contract this virus and don’t notice a thing", and that "You can't just talk about the consequences of the virus that you have to worry about.
Life goes on.
Brazil needs to produce.
You need to get the economy in gear.
"Bolsonaro continued to downplay the serious nature of the pandemic in the fall, citing his belief in the efficacy of chloroquine and other unproven drug to treat COVID-19.
Bolsonaro opposed proposals to purchase the Sinovac Biotech vaccine, but country's health agency granted approval for Phase 3 trials in São Paulo.
On 27 November, Bolsonaro touted the efficacy of any COVID-19 vaccine that is approved by the country's health agency, but added that he would not take any COVID-19 vaccine.
He also reiterated his believe that masks are ineffective at limiting the spread of the virus, calling it "the last taboo to fall".

Impact ==


===
Economy ===
Economists expect an economic stagnation for the country in 2020.
On 16 March, the Ministry of Economy announced a stimulus package of R$147.3 billion (US$29 billion) to help the economy against the effects of the pandemic.
The Brazilian government is also in negotiations with the New Development Bank to receive an aid package for its COVID-19 efforts; China received one billion USD from the same institution.
On 21 March, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes announced a series of aid measures to reduce the impact on the economy.
A scholarship for self-employed professionals, to the amount of R$200, is being prepared, in addition to the payment guarantee for workers who have reduced working hours.
On 23 March, government announced package of R$85.8 billion for states and municipalities.
The amount includes transfers to the health area, recomposition of transfers of constitutional funds and suspension of the maturity of debts of the states with the Union.
The economy shrunk by an unparalleled 9.7 percent in the second quarter of 2020 and plunged Brazil into a recession.

===
Education ===
By 20 March, the pandemic had impacted education all over the world.
There were nationwide school closures in over 100 countries.
However, President Jair Bolsonaro announced few country-wide measures to slow the spread of the virus, and because the federal government decided not to cancel classes in the whole country, lower levels of government have done so on independently.
Municipal, state, and private schools and universities had different reactions regarding the suspension of classes.
Classes were suspended at once, gradually or not at all.
Some of them were replaced with distance education or simply postponed.
Because of that, there are only "localized" (as opposed to "national") school closures, according to UNESCO.

===
Environment ===
The deforestation of the Amazon rainforest has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, increasing by over half compared to baseline levels, according to satellite imagery.
COVID-19 threatens indigenous communities in the Amazon region.

===
Favelas ===
By 17 March, residents of favelas in Rio de Janeiro suffered from a lack of water.
Without water to clean themselves, this made them vulnerable to the proliferation of coronavirus.
Water did not reach parts of the Baixada Fluminense and the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro.
Among the affected areas are the Chatuba de Mesquita, Camarista, Méier and Complexo
do Alemão communities.
The infectious disease doctor and pediatrician Cristiana Meirelles said that without clean running water, the situation of fighting the epidemic would become catastrophic.
Cufa (Central Única das Favelas, a NGO that operates with Favelas) called for measures to contain coronavirus in favelas.
Government actions did not include the economically fragile, a contingent that totals more than 70 million people, said the organization.
Some areas of Maré had been without water for two days, and other areas were reported to have been without water for two weeks.

===
Healthcare ===
Following the first reported cases in Brazil, there were concerns whether its healthcare system would be able to deal with the pandemic.
On 12 March, the Ministry of Health requested an additional R$10 billion (US$2.1 billion) to the federal budget as part of its efforts to manage the pandemic.
It estimated that 2,000 intensive care units would be immediately needed.
On 18 March 2020 hospitals in São Paulo denounced a lack of health materials, such as masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, caused by an increase in prices.
According to them, packages of masks went from R$4.50 in January to R$140 by 17 March.
The government said it will negotiate with industry to meet the demand.
In Salvador, local shops experienced shortages of masks and hand sanitizer.

Rio and five other municipalities in the state declared an emergency to contain the coronavirus.
The municipalities of São Gonçalo and Guapimirim also declared a state of emergency; Niterói, Nova Iguaçu and Mesquita declared an emergency situation in the area of public health.
On 19 March 2020 scientists predicted up to 2 million deaths in Brazil in the worst-case scenario, without measures to contain the coronavirus.
They pointed out that maintaining social distance was one of the most effective measures in the absence of a vaccine.
Their conclusion came after analyzing the growth curve of COVID-19 cases in Brazil.
The contagion rate was the same as that registered in Italy, as the number of infected people had been doubling every 54 hours.
According to estimates, the number of confirmed cases might reach 3,000 by 24 March.
According to the Ministry of Health, the number of infected patients would grow exponentially until the end of June.
The mayor of Belo Horizonte, Alexandre Kalil (PSD), asked General Altair José Polsin, commander of the 4th Army Region, for the temporary assignment of 51 professionals from the army garrison to assist in the demands of fighting the coronavirus.
The Brazilian Army has not yet said whether it will meet this demand.

Timeline of WHO's response to COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was confirmed to have spread to Cuba on 11 March 2020 when three Italian tourists tested positive for the virus.

==
Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.
Cuba faces multiple domestic challenges in its response to the ongoing pandemic.
Health professionals are facing challenges including shortages of medical supplies, poor sanitary conditions, and low wages.
Cuba also has one of the oldest populations in the Americas and one quarter of the population is considered at-risk.
Additionally, Cuba's economy is suffering due to the global decrease in tourism amid the pandemic.
As a consequence, the government began increasing centralization of the economy in an effort to prevent a deeper economic crisis like the one experienced by the country after the end of the Cold War.
Cuba's policy of “medical internationalism” has played a prominent role in the country's response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Cuba sent medical personnel to the hardest-hit Italian wealthy region of Lombardy, as well as Angola and a dozen Caribbean states including Suriname.

Cuba has engaged effective COVID-19 preventive measures, and despite the concurrent economic crisis and shortages of consumer products, officials have reporter that the country's population has only suffered minimal losses.
Regular testing, wearing of face masks, and health visits by nursing professionals have kept the reported case loads and mortality rates lower than in most countries of the Americas.

: First confirmed cases ===
On 30 January, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Rome.
A Chinese couple, originally from Wuhan, who had arrived in Italy on 23 January via Milan Malpensa Airport, travelled from the airport to Verona, then to Parma, arriving in Rome on 28 January.
The next afternoon, they developed a cough, and by evening the man had a fever; the couple were taken to the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases where they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalised.
On 2 February, a team from the same institute composed of scientists Maria Rosaria Capobianchi, Francesca Colavita, and Concetta Castilletti isolated the genomic sequence of the virus and uploaded it to GenBank.
On 30 January, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency with the duration of six months.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was the first EU country to take this kind of precautionary measure.
The government also introduced thermal scanners and temperature checks on international passengers arriving at Italian airports.

Lombardy is a densely inhabited area with a population of about 10 million.
The outbreak there came to light when a 38-year-old Italian tested positive in Codogno, a comune in the province of Lodi.
On 14 February, he felt unwell and went to see a doctor in Castiglione d'Adda.
He was prescribed treatments for influenza.
On 16 February, as the man's condition worsened, he went to Codogno Hospital, reporting respiratory problems.
Initially there was no suspicion of COVID-19, so no additional precautionary measures were taken, and the virus was able to infect other patients and health workers.
Later, the patient, his pregnant wife and a friend tested positive.
On 20 February, three more cases were confirmed after the patients reported symptoms of pneumonia.
Thereafter, extensive screenings and checks were performed on everyone that had possibly been in contact with or near the infected subjects.
It was subsequently reported that the origin of these cases had a possible connection to the first European local transmission that occurred in Munich, Germany, on 19 January 2020.

Doctors in Codogno stated that the 38-year-old patient led an active social life in the weeks before his illness and potentially interacted with dozens of people before spreading the virus at their Hospital.

A 51-year-old man from Piandimeleto who went to Romania with the man also tested positive and underwent self-quarantine at home.
On 26 February, one of the people with whom he had interacted in Romania tested positive.
On 26 February, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health confirmed that a 26-year-old Norwegian man living in Florence tested positive and had been admitted to Santa Maria Annunziata Hospital.
He had been staying in Norway for 14 days and had returned to Florence five days before becoming ill.

The passenger ferry GNV Rhapsody was placed under isolation in the port of Genoa with 58 crew members on board after a passenger tested positive for the virus after having sailed to Tunisia on the ship.
On 7 March, President of Lazio and leader of the Democratic Party, Nicola Zingaretti, tested positive for COVID-19.
Ten days before, he was in Milan attending public events.
The following day, President of Piedmont Alberto Cirio also tested positive.
A US Navy sailor stationed in Naples tested positive on 6 March.
Health officials in the US military began "a thorough contact investigation" to determine if any other person may have been exposed to the virus.
On 11 March, it was announced that Juventus and national team footballer Daniele Rugani had tested positive for COVID-19.GIMBE (Italy's Group for Evidence-based Medicine), in a report from 18 March, analysed data from the Istituto Superiore di Sanità and found that healthcare workers represented over 8% of all detected coronavirus cases.
On 26 March 2020, Italica Grondona became the world's oldest person to recover successfully from the coronavirus at the age of 102.
She was successfully recovered from the coronavirus after being tested positive with mild symptoms and was hospitalised in Genoa on 9 March for 20 days.
On 22 March, it was announced that Juventus forward Paulo Dybala and former Italy national team captain Paolo Maldini had tested positive for COVID-19.

===
March–
May 2020:
Under national lockdown ===
Starting on 8 March, the region of Lombardy together with 14 additional northern and central provinces in Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Marche, were put under lockdown.
Two days later, the government extended the lockdown measures to the whole country.
Two weeks later, the number of new cases per day started to show signs of slowing down, while the number of new deaths rose slightly.
On 31 March, the president of the Italian National Institute of Health, Silvio Brusaferro, announced that the pandemic had reached its peak in the country.
The news was confirmed also by the head of the Civil Protection, Angelo Borrelli.
Three weeks into the lockdown, its effects began to show.
Italy reported declines in the number of new cases and of new deaths per day.
The country also saw a steady decrease in the occupancy of intensive care units.
On 5 April, Italy had the lowest number of new daily deaths in two and a half weeks, and one day later the lowest number of new daily cases in three weeks.
On 20 April 2020, Italy saw the first fall in the number of active cases.

===
May–September 2020:
Reduction of cases and loosening of restrictions ===
COVID-19
cases started to decline in May 2020, thanks to the two-months lockdown.
Freedom of movements was re-established on 4 May and other not essential activities re-opened later in the month.

As of 21 July 2020, Lombardy was the Italian region with the highest number of people testing positive (95 459  units) and with highest amount of deaths officially registered and ascribed to the Coronovirus disease (16 788 units).

The number of young victims remained unknown.

===
September 2020 – October 2020:
Arrival of the second wave ===
Since the end of September 2020, the virus regained strength and grew its prevalence in the regions of Campania and Lazio.
This corresponded to a rise in new cases experienced also in other major European countries.

On 14 October, cases of COVID-19 positives exceeded the peak of the March infections.
On October 15, the governor of Campania closed schools and universities until 30 October 2020.

===
November 2020–January 2021:
A new lockdown ===
On 4 November 2020, Prime Minister Conte announced a new lockdown, dividing the country into three zones depending on the severity of the pandemic, corresponding to red, orange and yellow zones.
Moreover, a national curfew from 10 PM to 5 AM was implemented, as well as compulsory weekend closing for shopping malls, and online education in high schools.
Conte described the situation as "particularly critical", asserting that the virus was moving at a "strong and even violent" pace.

In red zones, lockdown measures were similar to the ones which were implemented from March to May 2020, such as compulsory closing for shops, restaurants and other activities, online education for schools except for kindergartens, elementary schools and sixth-grade classes, and no movements allowed except for working or necessity reasons.

In orange zones, restrictions included compulsory closing of restaurants and online education for high schools only, while movement within the home-town territory was still allowed.

In yellow zones, the only restrictions included compulsory closing for restaurant and bar activities at 6 PM, and online education for high schools only.
Starting from 6 November, Lombardy, Piedmont, Aosta Valley and Calabria were classified as red zones.
Sicily and Apulia were classified as orange zones, while the rest of the country was declared as yellow zone.
On 9 November, the autonomous province of South Tyrol was declared red zone as well.
In the following week, Campania and Tuscany were also declared red zones, while other seven regions, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Umbria, Marche, Abruzzo and Basilicata, became orange zones.
On 18 December, Abruzzo was added to the list of red zones.
On 2 December, a further movement restriction was implemented by the government in order to prevent an increase in cases during the Christmas holidays period, forbidding movement between regions from 21 December to 6 January.
To prevent people from gathering during Christmas, Saint Stephen's Day and New Year's Day, travel between different comuni was also restricted, and the curfew for New Year's Eve was extended to 7 AM.As of 13 December, no region was declared red zone anymore.
Abruzzo, Campania, Tuscany, the autonomous province of South Tyrol and Aosta Valley were classified as orange zones, and the remaining 16 regions and the autonomous province of Trento were yellow zones.

===
January–March 2021 ===


===
March 2021–present ===
On 1 March, Sardinia was the first region to become white zone, with no restrictions at all.
After 3 weeks from its change, on March 21, the region becames red zone, due to the ever growing infections.
On 8 March 2021 Italy passed over 100,000 deaths for COVID-19.Throughout the Easter holiday period, all Italy was put in red zone, to avoid trips to celebrate the holidays that could have led to further cases.

Betacoronavirus (β-CoVs or Beta-CoVs) is one of four genera  (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-) of coronaviruses.
Member viruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that infect mammals (of which humans are part).
The natural reservoir for betacoronaviruses are bats and rodents.
Rodents are the reservoir for the subgenus Embecovirus, while bats are the reservoir for the other subgenera.
The coronavirus genera are each composed of varying viral lineages with the betacoronavirus genus containing four such lineages: A, B, C, D.
In older literature, this genus is also known as "group 2 coronaviruses".
The genus is in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, of the order Nidovirales.

The betacoronaviruses of the greatest clinical importance concerning humans are OC43 and HKU1 (which can cause the common cold) of lineage A, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes the disease COVID-19) of lineage B, and MERS-CoV of lineage C. MERS-CoV is the first betacoronavirus belonging to lineage C that is known to infect humans.

==
Etymology ==
The name "betacoronavirus" is derived from Ancient Greek βῆτα (bē̂ta, "the second letter of the Greek alphabet"), and κορώνη (korṓnē, “garland, wreath”), meaning crown, which describes the appearance of the surface projections seen under electron microscopy that resemble a solar corona.
This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers, which are proteins that populate the surface of the virus and determine host tropism.
The order Nidovirales is named for the Latin nidus, which means 'nest'.
It refers to this order's production of a 3′-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs during infection.

==
Structure ==
Several structures of the spike proteins have been resolved.
The receptor binding domain in the alpha- and betacoronavirus spike protein is cataloged as InterPro: IPR018548.
The spike protein, a type 1 fusion machine, assembles into a trimer (PDB: 3jcl, 6acg​); its core structure resembles that of paramyxovirus F (fusion) proteins.
The receptor usage is not very conserved; for example, among Sarbecovirus, only a sub-lineage containing SARS share the ACE2 receptor.

The viruses of subgenera Embecovirus differ from all others in the genus in that they have an additional shorter (8 nm) spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE) (P15776).
It is believed to have been acquired from influenza C virus.

== Genome ==
Coronaviruses have a large genome size that ranges from 26 to 32 kilobases.
The overall structure of β-CoV genome is similar to that of other CoVs, with an ORF1ab replicase polyprotein (rep, pp1ab) preceding other elements.
This polyprotein is cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (see UniProt annotation of SARS rep, P0C6X7).

As of May 2013, GenBank has 46 published complete genomes of the α- (group 1)
, β-
(group 2),
γ-
(group 3), and δ-
(group 4) CoVs.

==
Recombination ==
Genetic recombination can occur when two or more viral genomes are present in the same host cell.
The dromedary camel Beta-CoV HKU23 exhibits genetic diversity in the African camel population.

Contributing to this diversity are several  recombination events that had taken place in the past between closely related betacoronaviruses of the subgenus Embecovirus.

Also the betacoronavirus, Human SARS-CoV, appears to have had a complex history of recombination between ancestral coronaviruses that were hosted in several different animal groups.

==
Pathogenesis ==
Alpha- and betacoronaviruses mainly infect bats, but they also infect other species like humans, camels, and rodents.
Betacoronaviruses that have caused epidemics in humans generally induce fever and respiratory symptoms.
They include:

SARS-CoV, SARS.

MERS-CoV, MERS.

SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19.
==
Classification ==
Within the genus Betacoronavirus (Group 2 CoV), four subgenera or lineages (A, B, C, and D) have traditionally been recognized.
The four lineages have also been named using Greek letters or numerically.
A fifth subgenus, Hibecovirus, was added more recently.
Member subgenera and species include:

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
More than 32.2 million confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 574,000 deaths, the most of any country, and the sixteenth-highest per capita worldwide.
The U.S. has about one fifth of the world's cases and deaths.
More Americans have died from COVID-19 than died during both World Wars and the Vietnam War combined.
COVID-19 became the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer.
U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.8 years in the first half of 2020.On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.
The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31.
Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing.
Meanwhile, Trump remained optimistic and underestimated the degree of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.

The first known American deaths occurred in February.
On March 6, 2020, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.
On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency.
In mid-March, the Trump administration started to purchase large quantities of medical equipment, and in late March, it invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 to direct industries to produce medical equipment.
By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories.
By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, and by November in all inhabited U.S. territories.

A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states, leading to daily cases surpassing 60,000.
A third rise in infections began around mid-October, leading to daily cases reaching over 100,000 by the end of the month.
A fourth rise in infections began around late March 2021 amidst the rise of a more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, just as COVID-19 vaccines began to be administered in the country.
State and local responses to the outbreak have included mask mandates, prohibition and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and school closures.
Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, and there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans.
Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas.

==
Timeline ==


=== December 2019 to February 2020 ===
In late November 2019, coronavirus infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China.
China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019.
On January 6, U.S. Health and Human Services offered to send China a team of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
health experts to help contain the outbreak, but China ignored the offer, which the CDC said contributed to the U.S. and other countries getting a late start in identifying the danger and taking early action.
After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on January 10 about the strong possibility of human-to-human transmission and urged precautions.
On January 20, the WHO and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had indeed occurred.
The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China.
Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was reported.
After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) – its highest level of alarm – warning that "all countries should be prepared for containment.
"
The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in America.
The next day, the U.S. declared a public health emergency.
Although by that date there were only seven known cases in the U.S., the HHS and CDC reported that there was a likelihood of further cases appearing in the country.
The Trump administration evacuated American nationals from Wuhan in late January; the evacuees were greeted by officials who did not wear protective gear because the Trump administration worried about "bad optics".
On February 2, the U.S. enacted travel restrictions to and from China.
On February 6, the earliest confirmed American death with COVID-19 (that of a 57-year-old woman) occurred in Santa Clara County, California.
The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21, by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County.
The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November.
On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.
However, large gatherings that occurred before then accelerated transmission.
The next day after the CDC warning, "Patient Zero", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz then thought to be the first community acquired case, became ill in New York City.
In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

===
March to April 2020 ===
By March 11, the virus had spread to 110 countries, and the WHO officially declared a pandemic.
The CDC had already warned that large numbers of people needing hospital care could overload the healthcare system, which would lead to otherwise preventable deaths.
Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from the coronavirus was 10 times higher than the common flu.
By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand.
On March 16, the White House advised against any gatherings of more than ten people.
Since March 19, the United States Department of State has advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel.
By the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs.
However, the number of available test kits remained limited, which meant the true number of people infected had to be estimated.
As cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients.
Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed.
Manpower from the military and volunteer armies were called up to help construct the emergency facilities.
Throughout March and early April, several state, city, and county governments imposed "stay at home" quarantines on their populations to stem the spread of the virus.
By March 27, the country had reported over 100,000 cases.
On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry.
On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy.
On April 19, the CMS added new regulations requiring nursing homes to inform residents, their families and representatives, of COVID-19 cases in their facilities.
On April 28, the total number of confirmed cases across the country surpassed one million.

===
May to August 2020 ===
By May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19.
State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast.
A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey.
On July 6, the United States Department of State announced U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization effective July 6, 2021.
The U.S. passed five million COVID-19 cases by August 8.On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), "the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)", as a new metric for disease severity, replacing the Symptomatic Case Fatality Ratio and the Symptomatic Case Hospitalization Ratio.
Per the CDC, the IFR "takes into account both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and may therefore be a more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19".
In July, U.S. PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to "shut it down now, and start over".
In July and early August, requests multiplied, with a number of experts asking for lockdowns of "six to eight weeks" that they believed would restore the country by October 1, in time to reopen schools and have an in-person election.
In August, over 400,000 people attended the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, and from there, at least 300 people in more than 20 states were infected.
The CDC followed up with a report on the associated 51 confirmed primary event-associated cases, 21 secondary cases, and five tertiary cases in the neighboring state of Minnesota, where one attendee died of COVID-19.

===
September to December 2020 ===
On September 22, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19.
On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for the coronavirus and would immediately quarantine.
Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone.
USA Today studied the aftermath of presidential election campaigning, recognizing that causation was impossible to determine.
Among their findings, cases increased 35 percent compared to 14 percent for the state after a Trump rally in Beltrami County, Minnesota.
One case was traced to a Joe Biden rally in Duluth.
On November 9, President-elect Biden's transition team announced his COVID-19 Advisory Board.
On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day.
Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective.
In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available.
In spite of recommendations by the government not to travel, more than two million people flew on airlines during the Thanksgiving period.
On December 8, the U.S. passed fifteen million cases, with about one out of every 22 Americans having tested positive since the pandemic began.
By December 12, TSA employees across U.S. airports had a 38 percent increase in COVID-19 infections.
On December 14, the U.S. passed 300,000 deaths, representing an average of more than 961 deaths per day since the first known death on February 6.
More than 50,000 deaths were reported in the past month, with an average of 2,403 daily deaths occurring in the past week.
On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28.
On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado.
The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to state, "Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected."

===
January to April 2021 ===
On January 1, 2021, the U.S. had twenty million cases, representing an increase of more than a million over the past week and ten million in less than two months.
On January 6, the CDC announced that it had found at least 52 confirmed cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in California, Florida, Colorado, Georgia, and New York; and it also stressed that there could already be more cases in the country.
In the following days, more cases of the variant were reported in other states, leading former CDC director Tom Frieden to express his concerns that the U.S. will soon face "close to a worst-case scenario".
It was believed the B.1.1.7 variant had been present in the U.S. since October.
On January 19, the U.S. passed 400,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 300,000 deaths.
On January 22, the U.S. passed 25 million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19.
On January 25, the U.S. reported its first case of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant from Brazil (P.1) in Minnesota.
Three days later, on January 28, the country reported its first two cases of a new, possibly vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variant from South Africa (B.1.351) in South Carolina.
On February 22, the U.S. passed 500,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 400,000 deaths.
By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico.
This number consisted of 2,672 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, 68 cases of the B.1.351 variant, and 13 cases of the P.1 variant.
In the first prime time address of his presidency on March 11, Biden announced his plan to push states to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1, with the aim of making small gatherings possible by July 4.
The circulation of COVID-19 variants in the U.S., in spite of ongoing vaccination efforts and reported decreases in overall infection numbers, have led to concerns by experts that the variants would fuel another surge in cases amidst the onset of spring break.
The TSA reported more than 1.3 million screenings at airports on March 12, the highest number since nearly a year ago.
On March 24, the U.S. passed thirty million cases, just as a number of states began to expand the eligibility age for COVID-19 vaccines.
Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases.
By March 27, more than 8,000 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant were reported across 51 jurisdictions.
By April 1, the number increased to more than 11,000, with cases mostly being reported in Florida and Michigan.
By April 7, the B.1.1.7 variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S.
On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new "double mutant" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India (B.1.617) in California.
By April 25, the country's seven-day average of new reported infections was reported to be decreasing, but concerns were raised about drops in vaccine demand in certain parts of the U.S., which were attributed to vaccine hesitancy.

Medical response ===


====
Initial response outside the U.S. ====
On January 6, a week after the U.S. was informed about the outbreak in China, both the Health and Human Services department and the CDC offered to send a team of U.S. health experts to China.
According to CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, the Chinese government refused to let them in, which contributed to the U.S. getting a late start in identifying the danger of their outbreak and containing it before it reached other countries.
Secretary Alex Azar said China did notify the world much sooner than it had after their SARS outbreak in 2003, but it was unexplainably turning away CDC help for this new one.
On January 28, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level 3, its highest alert.
Azar submitted names of U.S. experts to the WHO and said the U.S. would provide $105 million in funding, adding that he had requested another $136 million from Congress.
On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission.
The WHO team consisted of thirteen international researchers, including two Americans, and toured five cities in China with twelve local scientists to study the epidemic February 16–23.
The final report was released on February 28.In late January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages.
On February 7, The State Department said it had facilitated the transportation of nearly eighteen tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus.
On February 28, the State Department offered to help Iran fight its own outbreak, as Iran's cases and deaths were dramatically increasing.
Iran said, however, that U.S. sanctions were hampering its battle with the disease, which the U.S. denied, saying that Iran had mishandled the crisis.

====
Testing ====
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 can allow healthcare workers to identify infected people.
It is also an important component of tracking the pandemic.
There are various types of tests currently on the market; some identify whether or not a patient is currently infected, while others give information about previous exposure to the virus.

A report published in January 2021 revealed that a Chinese firm, BGI Group, was attempting to distribute its COVID-19 testing kits to at least 11 states in the US.
The U.S. intelligence and security officials raised warnings about the security risks involved in using these kits, as BGI was trying to use the patients' DNA, via the gene-sequencing machines that were being pitched to the U.S. labs.
However, federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services were pushing the states to use the BGI testing kits, despite such warnings.
Besides the 11 states, Nevada received the Chinese-made testing kits from Abu Dhabi's data and artificial intelligence firm, Group 42, in collaboration with BGI.
Some of the testing supplies were used in Nevada, but states like Alabama, South Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania didn't purchase the BGI kits.

====
Contact tracing ====
Contact tracing is a tool to control transmission rates during the reopening process.
Some states like Texas and Arizona opted to proceed with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place.
Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission.
Privacy concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in South Korea where authorities used cellphone tracking and credit card details to locate and test thousands of nightclub patrons when new cases began emerging.
Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts.
Congress has allocated $631 million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6 billion will be needed.
The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower.
Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which "may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials".
As of July 1, only four states are using contact tracing apps as part of their state-level strategies to control transmission.
The apps document digital encounters between smartphones, so the users will automatically be notified if someone they had contact with has tested positive.
Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email and phone communications.

====
Drug therapy development ====
In the United States, remdesivir is indicated for use in adults and adolescents (aged twelve years and older with body weight at least 40 kilograms (88 lb)) for the treatment of COVID‑19 requiring hospitalization.
In November 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
As of August 2020, there were more than 500 potential therapies for COVID‑19 disease in various stages of preclinical or clinical research.

=====
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine =====
In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients.
Among those were chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have been successfully used to treat malaria for over fifty years.
A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review.
One of Didier's COVID-19 studies was later retracted by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.
On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19.
The FDA said the available evidence showed "no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery".
On July 1, the FDA published a review of safety issues associated with the drugs, including fatal cardiac arrhythmias among other side effects.
In late July, President Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.
This contrasted with the position of the NIH, which stated the drug was "very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19".
====
Vaccine research, development, and deployment ====
From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research.
In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5 billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act.
On August 5, 2020, the United States agreed to pay Johnson and Johnson more than $1 billion to create 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
The deal gave the U.S. an option to order an additional 200 million doses.
The doses were supposed to be provided for free to Americans if they are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.
BIO, a trade group including all makers of coronavirus vaccines except AstraZeneca, tried to persuade Secretary Azar to publish strict FDA guidelines that could help ensure the safety and public uptake of the vaccine.
Politics impacted scientific practice, however, when chief of staff Mark Meadows blocked the FDA when it was realized that the timing of the provisions would make it impossible for a vaccine to be authorized before the November election.
Ultimately, the guidelines emerged from the Office of Management and Budget and were published on the FDA website.
On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11.
On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020.Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered.
The CDC and each state keep track of the number of vaccines administered.
After taking office in January 2021, new president Joe Biden signed an executive order to increase production and distribution of vaccines, aiming to have a hundred million doses administered within his first 100 days in office.
On February 13, 2021, the CDC published data showing that 50.6 million doses had been administered to 37 million people, 13 million fully vaccinated and the rest awaiting their second dose.
In an address on March 11, 2021, Biden announced that he would push for all states to make vaccination available universally to all adults no later than May 1 and announced other planned initiatives to enhance and widen distribution.

====
Medical supply shortages ====
The first known case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was confirmed by the CDC on January 21, 2020.
The next day, the owner of the medical supply company Prestige Ameritech wrote to HHS officials to say he could produce millions of N95 masks per month.
In a follow-up letter on January 23, the business owner informed the government that "We are the last major domestic mask company," without success.
On February 5, Trump administration officials declined an offer for congressional coronavirus funding.
Senator Chris Murphy recalled that the officials, including Secretary Azar, "didn't need emergency funding, that they would be able to handle it within existing appropriations.
"
On February 7 Mike Pompeo announced the administration donated more than 35,000 pounds of "masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials" to China the same day the WHO warned about "the limited stock of PPE (personal protective equipment)".
In February, the Department of Commerce published guidance advising U.S. firms on compliance with Beijing's fast-track process for the sale of "critical medical products", which required the masks shipped overseas meet U.S. regulatory standards.
According to Chinese customs disclosures, more than six hundred tons of face masks were shipped to China in February.
In early March, the country had about twelve million N95 masks and thirty million surgical masks in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), but the DHS estimated the stockpile had only 1.2 percent of the roughly 3.5 billion masks that would be needed if COVID-19 were to become a "full-blown" pandemic.
A previous 2015 CDC study found that seven billion N95 respirators might be necessary to handle a "severe respiratory outbreak".
As of March, the SNS had more than 19,000 ventilators (16,660 immediately available and 2,425 in maintenance), all of which dated from previous administrations.
Vessel manifests maintained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection showed a steady flow of the medical equipment needed to treat the coronavirus being shipped abroad as recently as March 17.
Meanwhile, FEMA said the agency "has not actively encouraged or discouraged U.S. companies from exporting overseas" and asked USAID to send back its reserves of protective gear for use in the U.S.
President Trump evoked the Defense Production Act to prohibit some medical exports.
Some analysts warned that export restrictions could cause retaliation from countries that have medical supplies the United States needs to import.

By the end of March, states were in a bidding war against each other and the federal government for scarce medical supplies such as N95 masks, surgical masks, and ventilators.
Meanwhile, as states scrambled to purchase supplies at inflated prices from third party distributors (some of which later turned out to be defective), hundreds of tons of medical-grade face masks were shipped by air freight to foreign buyers in China and other countries.
Medical organizations such as the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association implored Trump to obtain medical supplies, because they were "urgently needed".
That led President Trump to sign an order setting motion parts of the Defense Production Act, first used during the Korean War, to allow the federal government a wide range of powers, including telling industries on what to produce, allocating supplies, giving incentives to industries, and allowing companies to cooperate.
Trump then ordered auto manufacturer General Motors to make ventilators.
During this period, hospitals in the U.S. and other countries were reporting shortages of test kits, test swabs, masks, gowns, and gloves (collectively referred to as PPE.)
The Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a report regarding their March 23–27 survey of 323 hospitals.
The hospitals reported "severe shortages of testing supplies", "frequently waiting seven days or longer for test results", which extended the length of patient stays, and as a result, "strained bed availability, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and staffing".
The hospitals also reported, "widespread shortages of PPE" and "changing and sometimes inconsistent guidance from federal, state and local authorities".
At a press briefing following the release of the report President Trump called the report "wrong" and questioned the motives of the author.
Later he called the report "another fake
dossier".
In early April, there was a widespread shortage of PPE, including masks, gloves, gowns, and sanitizing products.
The difficulties in acquiring PPE for local hospitals led to orders for gowns and other safety items being confiscated by FEMA and diverted to other locations, which meant that in some cases states had to compete for the same PPE.
Prices skyrocketed across the board, with PPE costing up to 10x more than normally.
The shortages led in one instance of a governor asking the New England Patriots of the NFL to use their private plane to fly approximately 1.2 million masks from China to Boston.
At that time, Veterans Affairs (VA) employees said nurses were having to use surgical masks and face shields instead of more protective N95 masks.
In May, Rick Bright, a federal immunologist and whistleblower, testified that the federal government had not taken proper action to acquire the needed supplies.
An unexpectedly high percentage of COVID-19 patients in the ICU required dialysis as a result of kidney failure, about twenty percent.
In mid-April, employees at some hospitals in New York City reported not having enough dialysis machines, were running low on fluids to operate the machines, and reported a shortage of dialysis nurses as many were out sick with COVID-19 due to lack of sufficient
PPE.On May 14, a Trump administration official told reporters "we do anticipate having 300 million" N95 masks by autumn; however, at the end of September, there were only 87.6 million N95 masks in the government stockpile.
Supply problems persisted in August 2020, when a survey reported 42 percent of nurses were experiencing widespread or intermittent shortages of personal protective equipment, with 60 percent using single-use equipment for five or more days.
A September report by National Public Radio found some items were in short supply but others widely available, depending on the difficulty of manufacturing.
The DPA was effective in producing ventilators but less so in producing N95s.
As of September, the DPA had stimulated N95 production mainly by existing major manufacturers and less so by smaller companies.
Additionally, the DPA's provision that exempts manufacturers from antitrust laws had not yet been used to encourage collaboration in N95 production.
In response to demand, a number of domestic businesses retooled and due to lack of federal coordination ended up producing a glut of hand sanitizer and face shields, some losing money due to oversupply or lack of distribution.
Retooling and individual emergency supply making accounted for the production of at least 34.2 million pieces of PPE in the U.S., 14.5 million of which were face shields.
The federal government used the Defense Production Act to get a small number of large manufacturers such as 3M and Honeywell to increase production of the more difficult to manufacture N95 masks, but supply was still falling hundreds of millions of units short of demand.
NPR found the shortage could be resolved by providing government guarantees to small and medium-sized manufacturers so they could increase production of N95 masks without the risk of losing money or going out of business due to oversupply or drop in demand when the pandemic ends.
Instead, President Trump has denied the PPE shortages exist, calling them "fake news" in April and in September saying "we've opened up factories, we've had tremendous success with face masks and with shields.
"
Demand has also increased since the early weeks of the pandemic as various industries reopened, including medical and dental offices, construction, and trucking.
The 2020 California wildfires also increased demand for N95 masks for agricultural and other outdoor workers, due to state regulations requiring protection during poor air quality conditions.

====
Exceeded hospital capacity ====
Uncontrolled community spread led some medical facilities to refuse new patients or start transferring patients out.
In March and April, this happened in the Detroit, Michigan area and New York City area; Yakima, Washington in June; and in July it happened in Houston,
the Boise, Idaho area, Lake Charles and Lafayette, Louisiana,
and at dozens of hospitals across Florida.
By August, some hospitals in Mississippi were transferring patients out of state.
Arizona declared crisis standards of care in July 2020, allowing hospitals to legally provide treatment normally considered substandard to some patients in order to save others.
In January 2021, Southern California hospitals began to be overwhelmed with patients.
Officials in Los Angeles County, where some ambulances had to wait up to eight hours to discharge patients at emergency rooms, ordered EMTs not to bring a patient to the hospital if that patient had little chance of survival.
They also directed crews to take measures to conserve medical oxygen.

===
Federal, state, and local governments ===
The federal government of the United States responded to the pandemic with various declarations of emergency, which resulted in travel and entry restrictions.
They also imposed guidelines and recommendations regarding the closure of schools and public meeting places, lockdowns, and other restrictions intended to slow the progression of the virus, which state, territorial, tribal, and local governments have followed.

Effective July 15, 2020, the default data centralization point for COVID-19 data in the U.S. is switching from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Department of Health and Human Services.
However, "hospitals may be relieved from reporting directly to the Federal Government if they receive a written release from the State stating the State will collect the data from the hospitals and take over Federal reporting."
===
Military ===
On February 3, an unclassified Army briefing document on the coronavirus projected that in an unlikely "black swan" scenario, "between 80,000 and 150,000 could die.
"
The theory correctly stated that asymptomatic people could "easily" transmit the virus, a belief that was presented as outside medical consensus at the time of the briefing.
The briefing also stated that military forces could be tasked with providing logistics and medical support to civilians, including "provid[ing] PPE (N-95 Face Mask, Eye Protection, and Gloves) to evacuees, staff, and DoD personnel".

In mid-March, the government began having the military add its health care capacity to impacted areas.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), under the authority of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), leased private buildings nationwide.
They included hotels, college dormitories, and larger open buildings, which were converted into temporary hospitals.
The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City was quickly transformed into a 2,000-bed care facility on March 23, 2020.
The Army also set up field hospitals in various affected cities.
Some of these facilities had ICUs for COVID-19 patients, while others served non-coronavirus patients to allow established hospitals to concentrate on the pandemic.
At the height of this effort, U.S. Northern Command had deployed nine thousand military medical personnel.
On March 18, in addition to the many popup hospitals nationwide, the Navy deployed two hospital ships, USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort, which were planned to accept non-coronavirus patients transferred from land-based hospitals, so those hospitals could concentrate on virus cases.
On March 29, citing reduction in on-shore medical capabilities and the closure of facilities at the Port of Miami to new patients, the U.S. Coast Guard required ships carrying more than fifty people to prepare to care for sick people on board.
On April 6, the Army announced that basic training would be postponed for new recruits.
Recruits already in training would continue what the Army is calling "social-distanced-enabled training".
However, the military, in general, remained ready for any contingency in a COVID-19 environment.
By April 9, nearly 2,000 service members had confirmed cases of COVID-19.In April, the Army made plans to resume collective training.
Social distancing of soldiers is in place during training, assemblies, and transport between locations.
Temperatures of the soldiers are taken at identified intervals, and measures are taken to immediately remediate affected soldiers.
On June 26, 2020, the VA reported 20,509 cases of COVID-19 and 1,573 deaths among patients, plus more than two thousand cases and 38 deaths among its own employees.
As of July 2020, additional Reserve personnel are on "prepare-to-deploy orders" to Texas and California.

===
Private sector ===
Many janitors and other cleaners throughout the United States reported that they were not given adequate time, resources or training to clean and to disinfect institutions for COVID-19.
One pilot reported that less than ten minutes was allotted to clean entire airplanes between arrival and departure, which did not allow cleaners to disinfect the tray tables and bathrooms, for which the practice was to wipe down only those that "[look] dirty".
Cleaning cloths and wipes were reused, and disinfecting agents, such as bleach, were not provided.
Employees also complained that they were not informed if coworkers tested positive for the virus.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the federal agency that regulates workplace safety and health, investigated a small fraction of these complaints.
Mary Kay Henry, president of Service Employees International Union, which represents 375,000 American custodians, explained that "reopenings happened across the country without much thoughtfulness for cleaning standards."
She urged better government standards and a certification system.

Public response ===


====
Partisan divide ====
Polling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak.
In February, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was "a real threat": 70% and 72%, respectively.
By mid-March, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as "a real threat", while only 40% of Republicans agreed.
In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe "the worst was yet to come" (
79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (
83–53%).
The CDC was the most trusted source of information about the outbreak (85%), followed by the WHO (77%), state and local government officials (70–71%), the news media (47%), and President Trump (46%).Political analysts anticipated that the pandemic would negatively affect Trump's chances of re-election.
In March 2020, when social distancing practices began, the governors of many states experienced sharp gains in approval ratings.
Trump's approval rating increased from 44 to 49 percent in Gallup polls, but it fell to 43% by mid-April.
At that time, Pew Research polls indicated that 65% of Americans felt Trump was too slow in taking major steps to respond to the pandemic.
On April 16, Pew Research polls indicated that 32% of Americans worried state governments would take too long to re-allow public activities, while 66% feared the state restrictions would be lifted too quickly.
An April 21 poll found a 44% approval rate for the president's handling of the pandemic, compared to 72% approval for state governors.
A mid-April poll estimated that President Trump was a source of information on the pandemic for 28% of Americans, while state or local governments were a source for 50% of Americans.
60% of Americans felt Trump was not listening enough to health experts in dealing with the outbreak.
A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing.
58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020.
A poll conducted May 20–21 found that 56% of the American public were "very" concerned about "false or misleading information being communicated about coronavirus", while 30% were "somewhat" concerned.
56% of Democrats said the top source of false or misleading information about the coronavirus was the Trump administration, while 54% of Republicans felt the media was the top source of false or misleading information.
Studies using GPS location data and surveys found that Republicans engaged in less social distancing than Democrats during the pandemic.
Controlling for relevant factors, Republican governors were slower to implement social distance policies than Democratic governors.
There was a partisan divide over COVID vaccinations, with the counties that voted for Trump in greater shares having lower rates of vaccinations.

====
Protests and public disruptions ====
Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least two hundred U.S. cities in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus due to the close proximity of protesters.
Fauci said it could be a "perfect set-up for the spread of the virus", and that "masks can help, but it's masks plus physical separation.
"
One study found an increase in cases, while the Associated Press reported that there is little evidence for such an assertion.
On January 6, 2021, supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol building to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory.
At least one activist participated in the riot despite a recent positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and few members of the crowd wore face coverings, with many coming from out of town.
A group of maskless Republicans sheltering in place were recorded refusing masks offered by Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and as many as two hundred congressional staffers reportedly sheltered in various rooms inside the Capitol, further increasing the risk of transmission.
Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, later reported that members of Congress may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 while sheltering in place.
Four members of Congress have since tested positive due to the exposure.

====
International views of the United States ====
In September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations.
In some nations, the United States' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years ago.
Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively.

====
Other ====
The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.

===
Challenges ===
The American cultural values of individualism and skepticism of government have created difficulties in getting the population to abide by public health directives.
The prevalence of pandemic fatigue has resulted in further noncompliance.
Conspiracy theories and misinformation reached millions of Americans through social media and television commentary.
As a result, many people believe falsehoods, for example, that wearing masks is dangerous, that a global syndicate planned the virus, or that COVID-19 is a hoax.
Facebook announced that it had labeled or deleted 179 million user posts containing COVID-19 misinformation during the first three quarters of 2020.
President Trump repeatedly broadcast misinformation to downplay the threat of the virus and to deflect criticism of the administration's response.
Trump asserted he did this to "show calm," saying "I don't want to create a panic."
==
Impacts ==


===
Economic ===
The pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020.
The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April.
The total healthcare costs of treating the epidemic could be anywhere from $34 billion to $251 billion according to analysis presented by The New York Times.
A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns.
During the second quarter of 2020, the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop on record, with GDP falling at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent.
As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019.

In September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television.
Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice.
OpenTable estimated in May that 25 percent of American restaurants would close their doors permanently.
The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating
30–40 million are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020.
According to a report by Yelp, about sixty percent of U.S. businesses that have closed since the start of the pandemic will stay shut permanently.

===
Rural communities ===
In May, daily infection and death rates were still higher per capita in densely populated cities and suburbs, but were increasing faster in rural counties.
Of the 25 counties with the highest per capita case rates in May, 20 had a meatpacking plant or prison where the virus was able to spread unchecked.
By July, rural communities with populations less than 50,000 had some of the highest rates of new daily cases per capita.
Factors contributing to the spread of COVID-19 in these communities are high rates of obesity, the relatively high numbers of elderly residents, immigrant laborers with shared living conditions and meat-processing plants.

===
Social ===
The pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the disease itself and efforts to contain it, including political, cultural, and social implications.

From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans.
During the first year, an ad-hoc organization called Stop
AAPI Hate received 3,795 reports of racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations.
Of four studies published in September 2020, three found clear disparities due to race and the fourth found slightly better survival rates for Hispanics and Blacks.
As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates.
CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States.
Additionally, a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2020 revealed that the effect of stress and weathering on minority groups decreases their stamina against COVID.From 2019 to the first half of 2020, in the United States the life expectancy of a white person decreased 0.8 years; a Hispanic person, 1.9 years; and a Black person, 2.7 years.
The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites.
An NPR analysis of April
–September 2020 data from the COVID Tracking Project found that Black people's share of COVID-19 deaths across the United States was 1.5 times greater (in some states 2.5 times greater) than their share of the U.S. population.
Similarly, Hispanics and Latinos were disproportionately infected in 45 states and had a disproportionate share of the deaths in 19 states.
Native American and Alaskan Native cases and deaths were disproportionally high in at least 21 states and, in some, as much as five times more than average.
White non-Hispanics died at a lower rate than their share of the population in 36 states and
D.C.By April 2020, closed schools affected more than 55 million students.

===
Elections ===
The pandemic prompted calls from voting rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders to expand mail-in voting, while Republican leaders generally opposed the change.
Some states were unable to agree on changes, resulting in lawsuits.
Responding to Democratic proposals for nationwide mail-in voting as part of a coronavirus relief law, President Trump said, "you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again" despite evidence the change would not favor any particular group.
Trump called mail-in voting "corrupt" and said voters should be required to show up in person, even though, as reporters pointed out, he had himself voted by mail in the last Florida primary.
Though mail-in vote fraud is slightly higher than in-person voter fraud, both instances are rare, and mail-in voting can be made more secure by disallowing third parties to collect ballots and providing free drop-off locations or prepaid postage.
High COVID-19 fatalities at the state and county level correlated with a drop in expressed support for the election of Republicans, including the reelection of President Trump, according to a study published in Science Advances that compared opinions in January–February 2020 with opinions in June 2020.

==
Preparations made after previous outbreaks ==
The United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics.
In the most recent pandemic prior to COVID-19, the 2009 swine flu pandemic took the lives of more than 12,000 Americans and hospitalized another 270,000 over the course of approximately a year.
According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. in 2020 was the "most prepared" nation.

COVID-19 pandemic
Template:COVID-19 pandemic in India
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus reached the United Kingdom in late January 2020.

As of 24 March 2021, there have been 
4.3 million cases confirmed and 
126,172 deaths overall among people who had recently tested positive – the world's eleventh-highest death rate by population and the highest death toll in Europe.

There have been 152,205 deaths where the death certificate mentioned COVID by 16 April 2021 (see Statistics).
There has been some disparity between the outbreak's severity in each of the four countries.
Health in the UK is devolved, with England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each having their own publicly-funded healthcare systems and governments.
In February and early March 2020, COVID became a notifiable disease in the UK and testing of suspected cases began, including drive-through screening at hospitals.
A public health information campaign was launched to help slow the virus's spread, and the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, introduced the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 for England.
The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, outlined a four-pronged strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate.

On 23 March 2020, the UK went into lockdown.
The governments imposed a stay-at-home order banning all non-essential travel and contact with other people, and shut almost all schools, businesses and gathering places.
Those with symptoms, and their households, were told to self-isolate, while those with certain illnesses were told to shield themselves.
People were told to keep apart in public.
Police were empowered to enforce the measures, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave all four governments emergency powers not used since the Second World War.
However, the governments did not initially ban or quarantine incoming travellers.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer forecast that lengthy restrictions would severely damage the economy.
Lockdown was also forecast to worsen mental health and suicide rates, and cause further deaths due to isolation, delays and falling living standards.
A study found that lockdown worsened the population's mental health significantly.
The health services worked to raise hospital capacity and set up temporary critical care hospitals.
By mid-April it was reported that social distancing had "flattened the curve" of the epidemic.
In late April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had passed the peak of its outbreak.
Daily cases and deaths fell in May–June, and stayed at low levels over the summer.
The lockdown was gradually eased in June–July, while schools remained closed for summer break.

Most schools re-opened by early September.
Serious cases rose significantly that month, and local restrictions were gradually re-imposed in all four countries.
In England, tiered restrictions were introduced in October, the country went into a month-long lockdown (excluding schools) during November, and new tiered restrictions were introduced in December.
Scotland also introduced tiered restrictions in October.
Meanwhile, 'circuit-breaker' lockdowns were imposed in Wales for three weeks, and in Northern Ireland for eight weeks (with a one-week easing).
Schools stayed open during these lockdowns.

In December, a new COVID variant was blamed for a rise in cases in southeast England and led to more countries banning travel from the UK.
Following a brief easing of restrictions for Christmas, all of the UK went into another lockdown, including schools.
The UK became the first country to authorise and begin use of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a mass vaccination programme.
By early 2021, the UK had one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, and the highest in Europe.
In late January, testing and quarantine rules were imposed on all incoming travellers.
Serious cases fell sharply, and schools re-opened in March.

==
Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.
The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.
Genetic sequencing has traced most COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom to imported cases from Italy, France and Spain, rather than directly from China.

==
Mathematical modelling and government response ==
Reports from the Medical Research Council's Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London have been providing mathematically calculated estimates of cases and case fatality rates.
In February 2020, the team at Imperial College, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, estimated about two-thirds of cases in travellers from China were not detected and that some of these may have begun "chains of transmission within the countries they entered".
They forecast that the new type of coronavirus could infect up to 60% of the UK's population, in the worst-case scenario.
In a paper on 16 March, the Imperial College team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US.
It detailed the potential outcomes of an array of 'non-pharmaceutical interventions'.
Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall.
Until this point, government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.
On 16 March, the Prime Minister announced changes to government advice, extending self-isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.
A paper on 30 March by the Imperial College group estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.In April, biostatistician Professor Sheila Bird said delay in the reporting of deaths from the virus meant there was a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.

Winter 2019–20:
Arrival and embedment ===


====
September 2019 - January 2020 :
Suspected cases ====
In November 2019 Connor Reed, of Llandudno, a 25 year old student working at a school in Wuhan caught the virus; on 4 / 5 December he was taken to the local hospital.
After his recovery he acknowledged the Chinese authorities for their openness in terms of information.
A year later, after returning to Wales he was found dead at his flat in Bangor University.
In March 2020, it was reported that a 50-year-old man from East Sussex fell ill, also with COVID-19 symptoms, on 20 January after he returned from Ischgl in Austria, which is under investigation because it failed to report early cases on February.
Also, the three other members of his family and two friends from Denmark and one from Minnesota, US had same symptoms.
In May 2020, the BBC reported that several members of a choir in Yorkshire had suffered COVID-19-like symptoms shortly after the partner of one of the choir members returned from a business trip to Wuhan, China, on 17 or 18 December.
In June 2020 BBC reported it was found COVID-19 in UK
had at least 1356 origins, mostly from Italy (late February), Spain (early-to-mid-March), and France (mid-to-late-March).
Later that same month, Xinhua, the official Chinese state-owned news agency, reported that 53-year-old woman who fell ill on 6 January, two days after returning from a family trip to the Obergurgl resort in Austria, tested positive for antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in
late May. The agency reported that no other member of her family fell ill.
In August 2020 the Kent coroner certified that the death of Peter Attwood (aged 84) on 30 January had been related to COVID-19 ('COVID-19 infection and bronchopneumonia', according to an email on 3 September, after COVID-19 was detected in his lung tissue), making him the first confirmed UK victim of the disease.

He first showed symptoms on 15 December 2019.

Attwood had not travelled abroad.
In November 2020 it was reported that a 66-year-old had experienced symptoms shortly after returning from holiday in Italy in September 2019, and his 44-year-old daughter had experienced similar symptoms.

Scientists had previously speculated about COVID-19 in Italy as early as September 2019.

====
January 2020:
First confirmed cases ====
On 22 January, following a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States the previous day, in a man returning to Washington from Wuhan, China, where there were 440 confirmed cases at the time, the DHSC and Public Health England (PHE) raised the risk level from "very low" to "low".
As a result, Heathrow Airport received additional clinical support and tightened surveillance of the three direct flights from Wuhan every week; each was to be met by a Port Health team with Mandarin and Cantonese language support.
In addition, all airports in the UK were to make written guidance available for unwell travellers.
Simultaneously, efforts to trace 2,000 people who had flown into the UK from Wuhan over the previous 14 days were made.
On 31 January, the first UK cases were confirmed in York.
On the same day, British nationals were evacuated from Wuhan to quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital.
However, due to confusion over eligibility, some people missed the flight.

====
February 2020:
Early spread ====
On 6 February, a third confirmed case was reported in Brighton – a man who returned from Singapore and France to the UK on 28 January.
Following confirmation of his result, the UK's CMOs expanded the number of countries where a history of previous travel associated with flu-like symptoms—such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing—in the previous 14 days would require self-isolation and calling NHS 111.
These countries included China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.
On 23 February, the DHSC confirmed four new cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
A Nike conference on 26–27 February in Edinburgh led to at least 25 cases, including 8 residents of Scotland.
Health Protection Scotland established an incident management team at the time and traced contacts from delegates.
A report by Glasgow University on genomic epidemiology and the conference concluded this did not lead to further spread of the virus.
On 27 February, the first cases were confirmed in Northern Ireland.
On 28 February, the first case was confirmed in Wales, and a passenger on the Diamond Princess became the first Briton to die from the virus.

March 2020:
Closures and restrictions ====


=====
Early to mid-March:
closures and cancellations =====
On 1 March, a further 13 cases were reported including new cases in Greater Manchester; bringing the total to 36, three of which were believed to be contacts of the case in Surrey who had no history of travel abroad.
First case of the virus reported in Scotland.
On 3 March, the UK Government unveiled their Coronavirus Action Plan, which outlined what the UK had done and what it planned to do next.
Paul Cosford, a medical director at Public Health England, said widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom was "highly likely".
On 5 March, the first death from COVID-19 (within the UK), a woman in her 70s, was reported in Reading, and the second, a man in his 80s in Milton Keynes, was reported to have died later that day.

On 12 March, the total of cases in the UK was reported to be 590.
On the same day, the UK CMOs raised the risk to the UK from moderate to high.
The government advised that anyone with a new continuous cough or a fever should self-isolate for seven days.
Schools were asked to cancel trips abroad, and people over 70 and those with pre-existing medical conditions were advised to avoid cruises.

On 13 March, the 2020 United Kingdom local elections were postponed for a year.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised everyone in the UK against "non-essential" travel and contact with others, as well as suggesting people should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, and work from home if possible.
Pregnant women, people over 70 and those with certain health conditions were urged to consider the advice "particularly important", and would be asked to self-isolate within days.
On the same day, a second MP, Kate Osborne, tested positive after a period of self-isolation.

On 17 March, NHS England announced that all non-urgent operations in England would be postponed from 15 April to free up 30,000 beds.
General practice moved rapidly to remote working.
In March 2020 the proportion of telephone appointments increased by over 600%.
Also, the government provided a £3.2million emergency support package to help rough sleepers into accommodation.
With complex physical and mental health needs, in general, homeless people are at a significant risk of catching the virus.
On 18 March, the UK announced schools would close at the end of Friday 20 March.
First to announce was Welsh minister for education
Kirsty Williams, this was followed closely by a similar announcement for Scottish schools by Nicola Sturgeon.
Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill jointly followed suit for Northern Ireland schools.
Later the same day, Boris Johnson announced that schools in England would also close.
He also announced that public examinations would not take place as a result.
On 19 March, the UK Government downgraded the status of COVID-19 from a "high consequence infectious disease" (HCID) after consideration by the UK HCID group and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens.
On the same day, Boris Johnson, UK Prime Minister said "I do think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks, and I am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country but only if we take the steps, we all take the steps we have outlined.
"On
20 March, the government announced the closure of public venues, such as pubs, restaurants, gyms, leisure centres, nightclubs, theatres and cinemas.
The chancellor, Rishi Sunak also announced that the government would cover 80% of the salaries of retained workers until restrictions were over.

=====
Late March:
Restrictions begin =====
On 23 March, having previously advised the public to avoid pubs and restaurants, Boris Johnson announced in a television broadcast that measures to mitigate the virus were to be tightened to protect the NHS, with wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, under a stay-at-home order which would last for at least three weeks.
The slogan "Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" was introduced, often seen in capital letters, on a yellow background, with a red border.

The government directed people to stay home throughout this period except for essential purchases, essential work travel (if remote work was not possible), medical needs, one exercise per day (alone or with household members), and providing care for others.
Many other non-essential activities, including all public gatherings and social events except funerals, were prohibited, with many categories of retail businesses ordered to be closed.
Despite the announcement, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which made the sweeping restrictions legally enforceable, did not take effect until three days later on 26 March.
Operation Rescript and Operation Broadshare saw the deployment of the COVID Support Force, a military task force to support public services and civilian authorities in tackling the outbreak within the United Kingdom and overseas.
On 26 March, the number of UK COVID-19 deaths increased by more than 100 in a day for the first time, rising to 578, while a total of 11,568 had tested positive for the virus.
At 8:00 pm that day, people from across the UK took part in applause in appreciation of health workers, later branded as Clap for Our Carers.
This gesture was repeated on the next nine Thursdays, up to 28 May.
On 27 March, Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock announced that they had tested positive for the virus.
On the same day, Labour Party MP Angela Rayner, the Shadow Secretary of State for Education, confirmed she had been suffering symptoms and was self-isolating.
Chief Medical Adviser Chris Whitty also reported suffering from symptoms and would be self-isolating, while continuing to advise the UK government.
That day also saw the largest increase in the number of deaths, with the figure rising by 181 from the previous day, bringing the total to 759, while 14,579 cases had been confirmed.

On 29 March, it was reported that the government would send a letter to 30 million households warning things would "get worse before they get better" and that tighter restrictions could be implemented if necessary.
The letter would also be accompanied by a leaflet setting out the government's lockdown rules along with health information.
Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, suggested it could be six months before life could return to "normal", because social distancing measures would have to be reduced "gradually".
The first NHS nurse died of COVID-19.On 30 March, the Prime Minister's senior adviser Dominic Cummings was reported to be self-isolating after experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.
He had been at Downing Street on 27 March and was stated to have developed symptoms over 28 and 29 March.
Also, transmission within the community was thought to be decreasing, and hospital admission data suggested cases were increasing at a slower rate.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office repatriated tens of thousands of British nationals who had been stranded abroad by the coronavirus outbreak.

====
April 2020:
Lockdown continues ====
On 1 April, the government confirmed that a total of 2,000 NHS staff had been tested for coronavirus since the outbreak began, but Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemical reagents needed for COVID-19 testing meant it was not possible to screen the NHS's 1.2 million workforces.
Gove's statement was contradicted by the Chemical Industries Association, which said there was not a shortage of the relevant chemicals and that at a meeting with a business minister the week before the government had not tried to find out about potential supply problems.
On 2 April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, after his seven-day period of isolation, announced a "five pillar" plan for testing people for the virus, with the aim of conducting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.
The plan referred to ambitions to:

scale up swab testing in PHE labs and NHS hospitals for those with a medical need and the most critical workers to 25,000 a day in England by mid to late April, with the aligned testing strategies of the NHS in the Devolved Administrations benefiting from PHE's partnership with Roche through a central UK allocation mechanism;
deliver increased commercial swab testing for critical key workers in the NHS across the UK, before then expanding to key workers in other sectors;
develop blood testing to help know if people across the UK have the right antibodies and so have high levels of immunity to coronavirus;
conduct UK-wide surveillance testing to learn more about the spread of the disease and help develop new tests and treatments; and
build a mass-testing capacity for the UK at a completely new scale.

On 4 April, Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital as a "precautionary measure" after suffering from symptoms for more than a week with no improvement.
Catherine Calderwood, the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, resigned from her post after it emerged she had been spoken to by police for visiting her second home during lockdown.
On 6 April, Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London as his symptoms worsened.
First Secretary of State Dominic Raab assumed Johnson's duties.
On 7 April the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said that death figures were not accelerating as had been predicted but it was too early to tell whether the outbreak was peaking.
On 9 April, the number of daily recorded deaths was 881, taking the total to 7,978.
Dominic Raab said the UK was "starting to see the impact" of the restrictions
but it was "too early" to lift them, and urged people to stay indoors over the Easter weekend.
On 10 April, the UK recorded another 980 deaths, taking the total to 8,958.
Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, told the UK Government's daily briefing the lockdown was "beginning to pay off" but the UK was still in a "dangerous situation", and although cases in London had started to drop they were still rising in Yorkshire and the North East.
Johnson left hospital on 12 April.
On 14 April, figures released by the Office for National Statistics indicated that coronavirus had been linked to one in five deaths during the week ending 3 April.
More than 16,000 deaths in the UK were recorded for that week, 6,000 higher than would be the average for that time of year.
Several UK charities, including Age UK and the Alzheimer's Society, expressed their concern that older people were being "airbrushed" out of official figures because they focused on hospital deaths while not including those in care homes or a person's own home.
Matt Hancock announced new guidelines that would allow close family members to see dying relatives to say goodbye to them.
Hancock also launched a new network to provide personal protective equipment to care home staff.
On that day, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission began rolling out tests for care home staff and residents as it was reported the number of care home deaths was rising but that official figures, which relied on death certificates, were not reflecting the full extent of the problem.
Also on 15 April, Arlene Foster, the First Minister of Northern Ireland, extended the period of lockdown in Northern Ireland to 9 May.
On 16 April, Dominic Raab revealed that lockdown restrictions would continue for "at least" another three weeks, and to relax them too early would "risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress that has been made".
He set out five conditions for any easing of the lockdown .
On that day the number of recorded deaths increased by 861 to 13,729, while the number of cases of the virus passed 100,000, reaching 103,093.On 18 April, unions representing doctors and nurses expressed concern at a change in government guidelines advising medics to reuse gowns or wear other kits if stocks run low.
Robert Jenrick, the Secretary of State for Local Government, announced a further £1.6bn of support for local authorities, on top of £1.6bn that was given to them at the beginning of the outbreak.
On 29 April, the number of people who had died with coronavirus in the UK passed 26,000, as official figures include deaths in the community, such as in care homes, for the first time.
On 30 April, Boris Johnson said the country was "past the peak of this disease".

====
May 2020
: Lockdown easing begins ====
On 5 May, the UK death toll became the highest in Europe and second highest in the world.
On 7 May, the lockdown in Wales was extended by the Welsh Government, with some slight relaxations.
On 10 May, Prime Minister Johnson asked those who could not work from home to go to work, avoiding public transport if possible; and encouraged the taking of "unlimited amounts"  of outdoor exercise, and allowing driving to outdoor destinations within England.
In his statement he changed the "Stay at Home" slogan to "Stay Alert".
The devolved administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales did not adopt the new slogan as there had been no agreement with the UK government to change it, and because the announcement sent a mixed message to the public.

On 11 May, Johnson published a 60-page document called "Our Plan to rebuild: the UK Government's COVID-19 recovery strategy", with details of the COVID-19 recovery strategy for the UK.
In the report a new COVID-19 alert level system was announced.
At the same time the Cabinet Office published guidance on "staying safe outside your home", comprising eleven principles which "all of us" should adopt "wherever possible".
In May a COVID-19 alert system was announced, to be run by a new joint biosecurity centre.
When first announced, Johnson stated that the UK was on level 4, moving towards level 3.The Health and Safety Executive stated that from 9 March to 7
May they were contacted 4,813 times.
Around 8% of the complaints related to Scotland.
The executive managed to resolve 60% of them while another 40% needed further investigation, with some workplaces suspended whilst safety measures were put in place.
As of 17 May the executive had not issued any enforcement notices in relation to COVID-19.On
25 May
, the prime minister's adviser Dominic Cummings was criticised over his alleged breaches of the lockdown rules.
Cummings rejected the allegations, denying that he had acted illegally.
On 28 May, Durham police said that no offence had been committed when Cummings had travelled from London to Durham and that a minor breach might have occurred at Barnard Castle, but as there had been no apparent breach of social distancing rules, no further action would be taken.
The evening of 28 May saw the final Clap for Our Carers event.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced an easing of the lockdown in Scotland from the following day, with people able to meet friends and family outside in groups of no more than eight but keeping two metres apart.

===
Summer 2020:
Continued restrictions and local lockdowns ===


====
June 2020
====
On 1 June, Primary schools in England reopened to some reception (4–5 years), year 1 (5–6 years) and year 6 (10–11 years)
pupils with social distancing measures in place.

On 2 June the House of Commons was recalled for an earlier sitting to debate and vote on how to proceed with divisions, due to the pandemic.
On 3 June, briefings began (later referred to as 'press conferences') in a series that was set up by Welsh Government as a way of dispersing new information to the people of Wales regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales.

On 6 June, Parliament Square in London, saw thousands of people participating in the Black Lives Matter protest against racism and police violence in the UK, following the death of George Floyd apparently caused by US police in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
On 7 June, Health Minister Matt Hancock stated that although he supports the argument of the protests, there is "undoubtedly" a risk of a potential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases and the spread of the virus.
Non-essential shops reopened across the UK during this month.
On 8 June, the government introduced new quarantine rules from anyone coming into the UK, requiring individuals to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

On 15 June, England made face masks compulsory on all public transport.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps still advised people not to use public transport, but acknowledged that for some people this wasn't an option, especially as the use of public transport had been increasing throughout late May and early June, which brought fears of the coronavirus being transmitted on public transport.

====
July 2020
====
On 2 July, the government revised the total number of cases down by 30,302 because some people were counted twice in the earlier figures.

The actual increase in the number of cases for 2 July was 576 or 0.18%.Also on 2 July, the UK Government removed 75 countries from the England related quarantine list since they were now dubbed "low risk".
Travellers entering the UK would no longer have to self-isolate.

On 17 July, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock called for an urgent review into how COVID-19 deaths were recorded in England.

Public Health England had said that the figures for deaths included people that had tested positive for the virus months before their death.
On 24 July, in England, new regulations made it compulsory to wear face coverings in most indoor shops and public spaces.
Those breaking the rules could be fined up to £100.
Face coverings remained optional in some indoor venues where wearing a mask might be 'impractical', such as restaurants and gyms.
Exemptions were made for children under 11, individuals with physical or mental illness or disability, and for anyone to whom it might cause distress.
On 25 July, Health Ministers from all four governments met and agreed to add Spain back onto the quarantine list due to a spike in cases.
This drew criticism from the Spanish PM, Pedro Sánchez, as the outbreak was largely only happening in Catalonia.

On 27 July, the first confirmed case of an animal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the UK was reported, having been detected in a pet cat.
UK health officials said that the cat had probably contracted the coronavirus from its owners, but there was no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can transmit the disease to humans.
On 30 July, the UK government announced that people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire faced new restrictions, banning separate households from meeting each other at home after a spike in COVID-19 cases.
The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, meant people from different households were not allowed to meet in homes or private gardens.
On 31 July, the UK government announced they were delaying a further ease of lockdown restrictions in England until at least 15 August due to recent increases in cases.
This ease of lockdown restrictions would have allowed "higher risk settings", including bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos, to open on 1 August.
By the end of the month, levels of travel and commerce had started to recover across the UK, but not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.

====
August 2020 ====
On 2 August, a major incident was declared in Greater Manchester after rises in coronavirus infection rates.
On 12 August, the death count for England was reduced by more than 5,000 to 41,329.
Previously, people in England who died at any point following a positive test, regardless of cause, were counted in the figures.
However, the other UK nations had a cut-off period of 28 days.
On 14 August, thousands of UK holidaymakers in France were rushing to the borders to the UK, following the announcement of anyone returning from France after 4 am on 15 August to self-isolate for fourteen days, causing massive queues and traffic jams at the harbours and Eurotunnel.
On 28 August, shortly before the reopening of schools at full capacity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, New Scientist examined the three-month history of the test and trace system.

The magazine noted that the system had not met its targets and had been affected by an Internet outage in Southampton in the second week of August, affecting contact tracing for several thousand people.

It criticised both the lack of a backup for such a vital system and the lack of transparency.

Autumn 2020: Resurgence ===


====
September 2020 ====
On 6 September, concerns were raised over an increased number of cases in the preceding few days, a trend that continued into the following week.
On 8 September, the government published new social distancing rules to come into effect in England from 14 September, wherein all gatherings of separate households would be restricted to groups of six or few people (the so-called "rule of six"), excluding work or educational settings.
Similar rules were also later announced (to begin on the same date) in Scotland and Wales, although – unlike in England – with exemptions for young children.
On 9 September, these rules were further elaborated in a government press conference, alongside details of new legal requirements for data gathering on behalf of venues, social distancing "marshals" to enforce restrictions, and the outline of a "moonshot" plan to further control the virus with greatly expanded mass virus testing.
The £100bn "moonshot" plan was derided as lacking expert input by Professor Jon Deeks of the University of Birmingham and Cochrane, speculating on the consequences of false positives that might go along with testing such a large number of people.
The Welsh Government ended daily briefings in July, choosing to revert to a weekly press conference.
In September the BBC decided that they would not show every Scottish briefing on BBC One Scotland, but would take an editorial view in regards to public health and continue to show it on the news channel, they took the same view with the Welsh briefing.
In Scotland, more than 25,000 signed a petition calling on the BBC to reverse its decision.
On 18 September, the government tightened restrictions further in parts of the north-east of England.
Pubs were told to close every day from 10pm to 5am, and households were not allowed to mix.
Later, new restrictions were announced for parts of the North West of England, Midlands and West Yorkshire.
By now 13.5 million people, around 1 in every 5 UK residents, were living under some degree of extra local restrictions, including much of Northern England and Central Scotland, several council areas in the Midlands and South Wales, along with parts of Belfast and other areas in Northern Ireland.
On 21 September, the UK's coronavirus alert level was upgraded from 3 to 4, indicated the disease's transmission is "high or rising exponentially".

This decision followed a warning from the UK government's Chief Scientific Advisor earlier that day, that the UK could be seeing 50,000 cases a day by October unless further action was taken to slow the virus's spread.
Fears of a "second lockdown" caused a drop in UK stocks, although the following day the Prime Minister stated that potential additional restrictions would be "by no means a return to the full lockdown of March".
On 22 September, tightening of COVID-19 restrictions were announced by the UK government for England and the devolved administrations in the rest of the UK.
Including 10pm closing times for pubs across the UK and a ban on households meeting in other households in Scotland.
In a televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that additional rules to combat the case rise could last for a further 6 months.
On 29 September, the UK reported the highest daily rise in new infections with a total of 7,143 new cases.

==== October 2020:
Circuit breakers ====
On 1 October, restrictions were tightened further in the North-East of England, now banning all indoor gatherings within households.
The UK Government also advised people in the regions not to meet outside, although they did not ban people from meeting outside.

On 2 October, Margaret Ferrier, MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West received calls from other politicians, including the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon to resign from her seat.
She had been suspended from the SNP for travelling from Scotland to London to attend a coronavirus debate in the House of Commons while awaiting a coronavirus test result, and then travelling back to Scotland after testing positive for COVID-19.
Police also began an investigation.
On 3 October, Public Health England announced that a 'technical error' had caused under-reporting of new cases for recent dates, and that the missing positive results would be declared over the forthcoming days.
The number of new cases declared on 3 October was approximately double the rate prevailing over the preceding few days.
On 4 October, Public Health England made a further announcement that 15,841 cases had been left out of the daily case figures between 25 September and 2 October and that these would be added to the figures for 3 and 4 October.
The error was caused by a limit on the number of columns in an Excel spreadsheet.
Hugh Pym, the BBC's health editor, said that daily figures for the end of the week were "actually nearer 11,000"; around 7,000 had been reported.
Referring to the glitch, Labour used the term "shambolic".
A smoothed curve of estimates from the COVID Symptom Study suggested that new cases might be estimated to be running just below 8,000 per day.
After the corrections, total infections in the UK surpassed 500,000 – the fourth country in Europe to pass that milestone.

On 12 October, a three-tier legal framework was introduced in England to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in local and regional lockdowns, coming into effect on 14 October.
Liverpool became the first region under a Tier 3, which ordered the closure of pubs.
Households were also banned from mixing with each other in parts of the North-East of England and Manchester.
The Harrogate, Manchester and Sunderland Nightingale Hospitals were also told to reopen as hospital admissions had risen above the peak in March.
On 13 October, daily deaths increased by more than 100 for the first time since 27 July with 143 deaths recorded in the 24-hour period.

On 14 October, the Northern Irish government announced that from 16 October, Pubs, Restaurants and school closures as well as a ban on mixing in households would come into force, essentially putting Northern Ireland in lockdown.
Pubs and Restaurants would be closed for 4 weeks whereas schools would only be shut for 2 weeks.
On 15 October, the government announced that London would move to Tier 2 lockdown following a spike in cases, banning people from mixing indoors privately, while Greater Manchester would move to Tier 3, two months after a Major Incident was declared.
The Tier 3 restrictions on Greater Manchester were delayed as Johnson was in a dispute with the mayor, Andy Burnham, who wanted additional financial support for the area.
On 19 October, Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi was admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital and was being treated for pneumonia, after testing positive for COVID-19.
She had been feeling unwell for nearly two weeks, and was also self-isolating before being admitted to the hospital.
On the same day, Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford announced that Wales would go into a two week "time-limited firebreak" lockdown from 23 October to 9 November.
Leisure businesses, community centres, libraries, recycling centres and places of worship (apart from weddings and funerals) would shut whilst gatherings and the sale of non-essential goods would be banned.
Schools and colleges would initially shut for the scheduled half term and only reopen in the second week for pupils in year 8 (12–13 years old) and below.

On 30 October, the Office for National Statistics weekly infection survey in England showed that secondary school children ages 11 to 16 had the fastest rate of increase in COVID-19 incidence of any measured age range, giving them the second highest average incidence of 2.0% of any age range, fifty times higher than when children returned to school after the summer holiday, and slightly behind the 16 to 24 years old age range at 2.3% incidence.
Wales entered a 3-week firebreak period on 21 October, which was described by James Forsyth of the Spectator as "the most dramatic divergence between the UK nations
yet".
On 31 October, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that England would enter a four-week national lockdown on 5 November, when pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and non-essential shops would close.
Unlike in March, schools, colleges and universities would remain open.
In addition, the furlough scheme was extended to the end of November.
This came as the UK became the ninth country to exceed 1 million cases of COVID-19 nationwide.

==== November 2020:
New lockdowns ====
On 2 November, a five-level tier system came into force in Scotland to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in regional and local areas.
In Scotland, Edinburgh, Glasgow and all towns in the central belt were placed on level 3.

No regions of Scotland were immediately placed under level 4 restrictions.

On 5 November, England entered a second, four week long lockdown.

On 9 November, Wales ended its firebreak lockdown and returned to national measures.
Two household bubbles could be formed now, 15 people could meet indoors while up to 30 people could now meet outdoors.
Schools also reopened as well as non-essential businesses.
While travel restrictions within Wales were lifted, people couldn't travel to and from England unless there was an essential reason and the Welsh government still advised working from home.
Total deaths in the UK passed 50,000 on 11 November, the first European nation to do so.
It came as the governments of the various countries of the UK announced an evacuation-style plan to get university students home for Christmas and to continue studying from home.
By this time, the total number of cases reported was 1,256,725 and the death toll was 50,365.

The following day, 12 November, a new daily high of 33,470 COVID-19 cases which had tested positive were reported for the United Kingdom as a whole, making a new record for the daily figures since mass testing commenced.
On 13 November, Vaughan Gething, Health Minister, announced that initial positive test by Lighthouse Labs (Uk based) have been overturned by Public Health Wales and confirmed that all contact tracing in Wales is organised by the Welsh Government: and that they have contacted 9 out of 10 contacts received from people who have been infected.
"Also, the UK Government shortened quarantines for travellers arriving in England to seven days with a 'Test and Release' programme requiring those self-isolating to test negative before leaving quarantine.
Heathrow Airport also introduced rapid testing before travellers would board their flights.
On 23 November, trials showed that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford/AstraZeneca was 70% effective, which could be as high as 90% by tweaking the dose.
While hailed as a success, it was 25% less effective than the vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna.
On the same day, the UK government published some details of a proposed new three-tier legal framework which would apply in England from 2 December.
On 25 November, a total of 696 new deaths due to COVID-19 were announced for the UK, the highest daily figure of coronavirus-related fatalities reported since 5 May 2020.At the end of November, the UK Government announced it would offer four months of free vitamin D supplements to all those in care homes and shielders – with the prison service also providing supplements to prisoners.
On 29 November, Nadhim Zahawi Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industry was appointed as COVID vaccine deployment minister.
On 2 December, England ended its second lockdown and implemented a replacement three-tier system under The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers)
(England) Regulations 2020.

Winter 2020–21
:
Immunisation, new variant and surge ===


==== December 2020: First vaccines approved, new variant ====
On 2 December, the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine (BNT162b2) was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) making the UK the first country in the world to approve a COVID–19 vaccination.
The first consignment of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the UK on 3 December.
On the same day, government agreed under regulation secondary to the Vaccine Damage Payment Act 1979
the statutory ₤120,000 blanket payout for any person provably damaged by the vaccine, and by the same token, government-approved COVAX manufacturers were exempted from legal pursuit.
Individuals who provide the vaccine (and thus are permitted by government to do so) are also protected.
Statutory Instrument 2020
No.
1125
had on 16 October delegated permission to "the classes of persons permitted to administer medicinal products under the protocol" written by the MHRA, as opposed to delegating permission to NHS staff only as had been the practice before the publication of this instrument.
On 8 December, the immunisation campaign commenced, with 90 year-old Margaret Keenan becoming the first individual to receive the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the first administration of a COVID-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial.
This milestone was dubbed "V-day" by some media outlets, an allusion that combined the initial of "vaccine" with a reference to wartime victory celebrations.

She received her second dose on 29 December, and then had a 5 day wait for optimum protection.

On 19 December, it was announced that a new "tier four" measure would be applied to London, Kent, Essex, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, to try to control the spread of a new variant of the virus, Variant of Concern 202012/01.
At the time the restrictions were announced, the new variant was becoming more prevalent; it appeared to be more contagious than previous variants, but there was no evidence on its virulence and susceptibility to vaccinations were unclear.

Under tier four restrictions people are not permitted to interact with others from outside of their own household, even on Christmas Day.

This restriction would apply from midnight of 19/20 December.

Johnson announced that relaxation of rules outside the new tier 4 over Christmas would now only be for Christmas Day.

It was also announced that restrictions would tighten in Wales.

Nicola Sturgeon announced that the whole of Scotland would enter Scotland's tier four, and travel to and from the rest of the UK would be banned.
An exception in Scotland was likewise provided for Christmas Day, and a five-day relaxation of rules was cancelled.
From 20 December 2020 countries around the world were introducing bans on travel from the UK as the first response to the new variant.

Operation Brock was implemented to park lorries on the M20 motorway as ferry travel to France for passengers and accompanied freight were stopped entirely.

Unaccompanied freight could continue to move, and goods traffic from France into the UK was not directly affected, although drivers may be reluctant to enter the UK and have to quarantine on return.

On 22 December, France started allowing accompanied freight again, as long as the driver had proof of a negative COVID-19 test within the past 72 hours.

On 24 December, the Office for National Statistics weekly infection survey in England showed that COVID-19 incidence in secondary school children ages 11 to 16 had increased to 3.0%, the highest of any measured age range and two and a half times higher than the all ages average of 1.2% incidence.
Subsequently Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced on 30 December that schools in some English areas with high COVID-19 levels would remain closed to most children after the Christmas holiday for the first week or two of January, reversing his previous position.
The government expected secondary schools to offer weekly lateral flow COVID-19 tests to pupils from January.
Former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Mark Walport stated that secondary school children were seven times more likely to introduce COVID-19 into a household than other members of a household.
UK hospitals and emergency services came under severe strain in late December, surpassing their previous record of highest hospital capacity set in April as a result of a record surge in COVID-19 cases.
London emergency services had one of the "busiest days ever" on 26 December, and hospitals across the Southeast restricted staff leave and non-COVID related care in response.
The NHS warned of further strain on resources, deaths and hospitalizations into January.
A record 55,892 new cases were reported on 31 December, along with 964 deaths.
On 30 December the (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or AZD1222) vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca
(the British-Swedish pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company), became the second Covid-19 vaccine approved for use in the UK, for deployment the following week.
This advance was reported to allow for a rapid increase in the speed of the vaccination programme, due to more doses being available, and due to the Oxford vaccine's higher storage temperature making distribution easier.
On the same day, Covid restrictions increased across England as regions containing 20 million people were escalated to the highest "tier 4" restrictions, across the North of England, the Midlands, and the South West.

====
January 2021: Vaccination expands and third lockdown ====
On 4 January 82-year-old Brian Pinker became the first person to receive the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine as the UK vaccination programme expanded to include it.
On the same day, the Prime Minister stated that Covid-induced restrictions would likely increase as cases continued to surge across the country, with more than 50,000 daily cases reported for the sixth consecutive day, and the Labour Party calling for immediate escalated action across England.
In addition, the First Minister of Scotland announced new restrictions for Scotland, with stay-at-home orders issued and closure of schools until February.
The Prime Minister later confirmed that England would enter a third lockdown from 5 January, with similar restrictions to the first lockdown in March 2020, including school closures unlike the second lockdown in November.
Restrictions were initially expected to last until mid-February.
In Wales, the government confirmed that schools and colleges will remain closed until 18 January, this was later extended to 22 February.
On 6 January the House of Commons was recalled from recess to debate and vote on regulations relating to public health.
On 8 January 2021, MRNA-1273 (commonly known as the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine) was the third Covid-19 vaccine approved for use in the UK.
In total, 17 million doses have been ordered.
After receiving approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on 30 December 2020, the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine started being administered in Scotland on 11 January 2021, in GP practices and community centers across the country.
On 26 January, the Prime Minister announced in an address that in the period leading up to 25 January from the start of the pandemic, over 100,000 people in the UK had died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, the UK being the fifth country to reach this number of deaths.
The following day, the Prime Minister also announced a plan for "phased easing" of restrictions beginning in early March dependent on the statistics at that time, although also noting that schools in England would remain closed until 8 March "at the earliest".
Northern Irish schools were later confirmed to also be closed until this date, although on 29 January it was announced that schools in Wales could still open as soon as 22 February if cases continued to fall in the region.

====
February 2021:
Variants of concern and vaccination efficacy ====
On 1 February, urgent testing was ordered after community cases of a South African Covid-19 variant were found in England, believed to be more contagious than other variants.
On 3 February it was reported that a new version of the Oxford vaccine could be ready by the Autumn to tackle mutated variants.
On 8 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said that the UK public should "have confidence" in the UK's vaccines, after a study found that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had "minimal protection" against mild disease caused by the South African COVID-19 variant.
The health minister however stated that there was "no evidence" that the vaccine would not protect against "severe illness".
Other variants, such as the Kent "B117" variant, were previously found to still be effectively protected against by the Oxford vaccine.
It was also announced that booster shots to protect against disease variants could eventually be provided.
By 14 February, the UK successfully hit its target of 15 million first-dose COVID-19 vaccinations by mid-February, encompassing the top four priority groups for vaccination.
Next phrase rollouts were announced to cover those aged 65–69
in England, among other groups.
On 16 February, scientists in the UK identified another new variant of the coronavirus B.1.525, which appears similar to the South African
501.V2 variant and has been seen in other countries, including Denmark, Nigeria and the United States.
B.1.525 has been listed as a 'variant under investigation' as it is too soon to say if it should be added to the UK's list of variants of concern and whether mass testing for it should happen.
Ravi Gupta of the University of Cambridge has said the new variant appeared to have significant mutations already seen in some of the other new variants, which means its likely effect can be predicted.
Public Health England has said there is no evidence that the mutations in the new variant make the virus more transmissible or cause severe disease.
On 20 February, the government announced a new vaccination target, to offer all UK adults the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of July, bringing a previous September target forward to the Summer.
On 22 February, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid out a country-wide roadmap for lockdown lifting, including a four-step plan for England that would see all lockdown restrictions removed by 21 June at the earliest.
Other UK leaders laid out plans for lifting of restrictions for the other UK nations, including a plan for Scotland that would ultimately lead to the country returning to local restriction tiers, and additional reviews planned in the following weeks for Wales and Northern Ireland.
While explaining the English plan, Johnson emphasized the "cautious but irreversible" nature of the plan, with easing determined by "data not dates", and delays to the roadmap being possible if the country failed to meet conditions on the state of the pandemic.
Indicative dates in the announcement were:

8 March –
schools re-open
29 March – two households or six people allowed to meet outdoors, travel permitted outside local area
12 April (or later) –
opening of non-essential retail and personal services, and other lockdown easing; this date was confirmed at a government press conference on 5 April.

17 May (or later) –
most rules affecting outdoor social contact will be removed, two households or six people can meet indoors, indoor hospitality services can be provided and hotels can open
21 June (or later) –
all lockdown limits removed.
Furthermore, the PM announced that international travel would not resume until 17 May; the country aiming to permit free international movement of vaccinated travellers.
At the end of the month, it was announced that six cases of the Lineage P.1 variant had been detected in the UK, three in Scotland and three in England.
However, the identity of one of the English people tested positive was not known and an intensive search for them was begun.
Those infected had flown to the UK shortly before the hotel quarantine measures had come in to place.

==
UK and devolved government responses ==
Because of devolution, the responses by each of the four nations have differed from one another; the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive have produced different policies to those produced by Government of the United Kingdom (many of which apply only to England).
The National Health Service is the publicly funded healthcare system in the UK; each nation has its own National Health Service and public health bodies, funded by devolved block grants via the Barnett formula and accountable to their devolved governments.

==
National health services response ==
Healthcare in the UK is a devolved matter, with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, funded by and accountable to separate governments and parliaments.
As a result of each country having different policies, laws and priorities, a variety of differences now exist between these systems.

=== Equipment ===


====
Personal protective equipment ====
As early as February 2020 frontline healthcare workers began to raise their concern regarding the UK's preparedness to cope with a large-scale outbreak.
On 2 March a poll conducted by the Doctors' Association UK found that just 8 out of 1600 doctors though the NHS was well prepared to deal with Coronavirus.
On 16 March, primary care magazine Pulse reported doctors were receiving out-of-date PPE that had had its 2016 use-by date covered with a sticker saying "2021".
In response, the government offered reassurance that this was safe.
Earlier in the month, in response to a survey of Pulse's readership, two of five GPs reported they still did not have PPE to protect them from coronavirus.
Some of these concerns were raised with Johnson during Prime Minister's Questions, to which the Prime Minister replied the UK had "stockpiles" of PPE.
The same day, the Doctors' Association UK (DAUK) reported NHS staff felt they were being put at risk due to lack of PPE.On 22 March, in a letter with 3,963 signatures co-ordinated by the Doctors' Association UK published in The Times, NHS staff asked Johnson to "protect the lives of the life-savers" and resolve the what they saw as the "unacceptable" shortage of protective equipment.
On 23 March, in an effort to meet demand and due to concerns about the rising number of medics becoming ill after exposure to the virus, the NHS asked DIY stores to donate PPE for use by NHS staff.
Frontline healthcare workers raised concerns that they had been forced to source their own PPE from Screwfix.
Hancock said there were "challenges" with supplying PPE to NHS staff and said a million masks had been bought that weekend.
The following day, the government said there was enough PPE for everyone in the NHS who needed it; this was contradicted by the Royal College of Nursing, the British Medical Association (BMA), and the Doctors' Association UK which warned that without enough PPE, doctors would die.

On 1 April, the government said 390 million pieces of PPE had been distributed to the health service in the past fortnight.
The Royal College of Midwives (RCM), BMA and DAUK said the supplies had yet to reach medical staff.
The RCM, in a joint statement with unions, including Unite, Unison and the GMB, said the lack of PPE was now 'a crisis within a crisis'.
On 9 April it was reported that protective gowns were set to run out by that weekend in London.
On 10 April the UK Government sent out a document to PPE suppliers informing them that suppliers of certain medical equipment, including protective masks, gloves and aprons, must be registered with the Care Quality Commission, which regulates all health and social care services in England only.
There was not a similar agreement in place between suppliers and Care Inspectorate Wales or the Care Inspectorate of Scotland.
The Welsh Government advised care home providers that they should order through their local council, while Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price lodged a formal complaint with the European Union over the issue.
The manager of two care homes in Gwynedd, Wales, was told by two suppliers that they would only sell to care homes in England.
The chief executive of the care home umbrella group Scottish Care said that the UK's four largest PPE suppliers had said they were not distributing to Scotland because their priority was going to be "England, the English NHS and then English social care providers".
The UK government reported that it had not instructed any company to prioritise PPE for any nation.
Healthcare supplier Gompels' website said at the time that "These restrictions are not something we have decided, they are a criteria[sic]
given to us by Public Health England".
After collating data from over 1500 frontline NHS doctors on ongoing shortages the Doctors' Association UK demanded a public inquiry into the government's failure to adequately procure and supply PPE and healthcare worker deaths.
As of August 2020 over 120,000 people had signed a petition for a public inquiry into healthcare worker deaths and PPE and DAUK launched a legal challenge for a judicial review.
A BBC Panorama episode, Has the government failed the NHS?,
broadcast on 27 April, said the government had been counting PPE items in a way that artificially inflated the total.
Gloves were counted individually, rather than as pairs, for instance, and non-PPE items, such as paper towels and detergent, were included in the figure.
The programme also said the government was changing the guidance on what PPE was appropriate for medical staff to wear when treating COVID-19 patients, not according to best protective procedure, but according to the stock available.
The programme also said that, in the years before the pandemic, the government had ignored expert advice and failed to stockpile essential items.
Due to lack of stock, in May an NHS trust prioritised anti-bacterial ventilator filters for coronavirus patients over others. .
====
Ventilators ====
On 16 March, Boris Johnson held a conference call with business leaders and set them the target of delivering 30,000 ventilators in a fortnight; the government also declined to join an emergency European Union scheme to procure ventilators and other emergency equipment like personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital staff, saying the UK was no longer part of the EU and that this was area in which it was making its own efforts.
Existing ventilator stocks stood at 5,900 at the beginning of the outbreak.
On 29 March, the government issued a specification for the "minimally clinically acceptable" manufacture and use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines.

===
Staffing ===
In March 2020, the NHS asked retired staff  and final year medical students to return to work.
Over 20,000 former staff took this up.
Whilst ventilators were procured frontline NHS staff raised concerns about a lack of trained staff to operate them.
On 15 March both the BMA and the Doctors' Association UK both raised the alarm that the NHS was short of nearly 43,000 nurses and 10,000 doctors prior to the pandemic.
Concerns were also raised that staff were being pressured to return from self-isolation early due to severe short staffing.
On 21 March, the NHS had agreed to use, at cost price, almost the entire private healthcare system, bringing 20,000 medical staff into the national effort.
On 24 March, Matt Hancock launched a scheme to recruit 250,000 volunteers to support the NHS through the pandemic.
The volunteers would carry out jobs like collecting and deliver shopping, medication or "other essential supplies" for people in isolation; transporting equipment and medication between NHS services; transporting medically fit patients and providing telephone support to people at risk of loneliness because of self-isolation.
The target was surpassed in 24 hours and was raised to 750,000.
The scheme was paused on 29 March after the new target was reached.
Military personnel from the newly-formed COVID Support Force helped staff NHS Nightingale hospitals, mobile test centres and some ambulance services.

===
Temporary critical care hospitals ===
In Northern Ireland capacity was upgraded at Belfast City Hospital, while in Scotland, NHS Louisa Jordan was established in Glasgow by NHS Scotland.
NHS England established temporary "Nightingale" hospitals in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Harrogate.
The Dragon's Heart Hospital was set up at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales.
Military personnel from the COVID Support Force assisted with the construction and subsequent staffing.

=== Do Not Resuscitate orders ===
In February 2021, The Guardian and the charity Mencap reported that people with learning disabilities were given Do Not Resuscitate orders.
A Catholic priest and doctor, Patrick Pullicino, requested an independent inquiry into the practice.
Pullicino says that the source is the COVID-19 critical care referral algorithm, which indicates people such as these are not eligible for ITU care, being high-risk.
Public Health England indicated in a study in November 2020 that people with learning disabilities were up to six times more likely to die than anyone else.

==
Testing and monitoring ==
Shortly after confirming that the cause of the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan was a new coronavirus, Chinese authorities had shared its genetic sequence for international developments of diagnostic kits.
By 10 January, the UK had developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease, performed on a sample from the nose, throat, and respiratory tract and tested at PHE's public health laboratory at Colindale in London.
Testing of patients began within days, and by 3 February 326 tests had been performed in the UK.
Over the following few weeks, PHE made the test available to 12 other laboratories in the UK, making it possible to test 1,000 people a day.
By 12/13 March 2020, 29,764 tests had been conducted in the UK, corresponding to 450.8 tests per million people.
On 24 March, Matt Hancock said the government had bought 3.5m kits that would test if a person has already had COVID-19; no date was given for their arrival.
These tests would allow people to know if they were immune and therefore able to "go back to work".
It was later found when the kits, which had cost at least £16 million, were tested, they did not meet the required specifications.
Hancock announced on 28 March that 10,000 tests a day were now being processed; the actual figure was 5,000.
As of 31 March 143,186 people had been tested.
The UK government and Public Health England were criticised for what some saw as a failure to organise mass testing.
On 28 March the editor-in-chief of The Lancet published a condemnation of what he saw as government inaction and ignoring of WHO advice.
On 31 March, former WHO director Anthony Costello, following WHO advice that countries should "test, test, test", said the key to the UK's transitioning out of lockdown was mass testing, and that the UK had the capacity to reach the level of testing being carried out by Germany (70,000 tests a day, compared to the UK's 5,000) but the government and Public Health England (PHE) had been too slow and controlling to organise.
The day after, Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, chair of the Health and Social Care Select Committee and former Health Secretary, said it was "very worrying" that the government had not introduced mass testing because doing so had been "internationally proven as the most effective way of breaking the chain of transmission".
On 2 April, The Telegraph reported that one of the Government's science advisers, Graham Medley, said "mass public testing has never been our strategy for any pandemic".
Medley also said the Government "didn't want to invest millions of pounds into something that is about preparedness".

The UK Government launched a booking portal for people to be tested for COVID-19.
The governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland governments signed up to use the portal that England were using.
The Welsh Government went on to partner with Amazon to create a portal.
Later this was scrapped with the Welsh Government citing issues around collecting of data having been resolved with the UK government's portal and now wanted to use it, having only released their version across south east Wales.
In May, the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England confirmed that two samples taken from single subjects, such as in the common saliva and nasal swab test, are processed as two separate tests.
This, along with other repeated tests such as checking a negative result, led to the daily diagnostic test numbers being over 20% higher than the number of people being tested.
On 18 May, testing was extended to anyone over the age of five after the governments of all four nations agreed to the change.
On 29 September, a letter in Lancet highlighted the increasing likelihood of overestimating of COVID-19 incidence as more asymptomatic people are included in RT-PCR testing with consequent "misdirection of policies regarding lockdowns and school closures," noting that the false-positive rate in the UK is currently unknown, with "preliminary estimates ... somewhere between 0·8% and 4·0%".
The letter called for "stricter standards ... in laboratory testing, ... and pretest probability assessments ...
[including] symptoms, previous medical history of COVID-19 or presence of antibodies, any potential exposure to COVID-19, and likelihood of an alternative diagnosis."

Special arrangements were made with Royal Mail for the delivery of testing kits and their collection from designated "Priority Postboxes", which were identified by the attachment of special stickers.
By the week 12–18
January 2021 testing was running at 3,970,346 tests per week.

By 9 February 2021, 75,693,515 tests had been done.

===
England ===
Following 300 staff being asked to work from home on 26 February in London, while a person was awaiting a test result for the virus, PHE expanded testing around the UK to include people with flu-like symptoms at 100 GP surgeries and eight hospitals: the Royal Brompton and Harefield, Guy's and St Thomas' and Addenbrookes Hospital, as well as hospitals at Brighton and Sussex, Nottingham, South Manchester, Sheffield, Leicester.
Drive-through screening centres were set up by Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust at Parsons Green Health Centre on 24 February 2020, A further drive-through testing station was set up by the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust at a site just off the A57 Sheffield Parkway dual-carriageway on 10 March; in this case, patients ringing NHS 111 with coronavirus-like symptoms in the Sheffield area will be told to drive, if possible, to the testing centre at an allotted time.
On 11 March, NHS England announced that testing in NHS laboratories would increase from testing 1,500 to 10,000 per day.
The test consists of taking a sample from the nose, throat, deeper lung samples, blood or stool, and transporting the packed samples to the listed PHE regional laboratory designated for the referring laboratory region.
On 14 May PHE approved an antibody test by Swiss company Roche.
Abbott Laboratories said that they also had an antibody test approved by the public health boards of England, Scotland and Wales.
The British Medical Association (BMA) asked 8,190 doctors and medical students in England about their concerns about COVID-19; the results were published on 14 September 2020.
86% of respondents expected a second peak, and it was the main concern for 30%.
89% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that  the failure of test and trace risked causing a second wave.

===
Scotland ===
On 29 February drive-through testing was set-up by NHS Lothian at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.

On 1 March 2020
it was reported that surveillance was shortly to be extended to some hospitals and GP surgeries in Scotland.
Scotland were developing their own contact tracing system, with contact tracing being done by telephone rather than an app.

===
Wales ===
On 21 March, Welsh Government Health Minister Vaughan Gething said that the target was 9,000 tests by the end of April.
Public Health Wales Chief Executive Tracey Cooper confirmed on 7 May that Wales was to receive an extra 5,000 COVID-19 test kits per day, before the UK Government stepped in and stopped them.
The Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche Diagnostics and the Welsh Government had a gentleman's agreement, verbally and through emails.
Dr Cooper blamed the UK government "for gazumping Wales's Covid-19 testing deal" with Roche; this left Wales only able to carry out 800 tests a day.
Public Health England said that it had not interfered with any contract but said "The UK Government recently asked us to establish a partnership with Roche to support increased diagnostic testing in the UK for Covid-19."On 21
May 2020
the Welsh Government announced that one of the new antibody blood tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is being produced by Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (OCD) at Pencoed, Wales, in partnership with Public Health Wales.
The test will be rolled out, prioritised and managed and will also be available in care homes.
According to Health Minister Vaughan Gething, this test is an important part of the "Test, Trace, Protect" strategy which will help Wales come out of lockdown.

===
Mobile phone apps ===
On 4 May, a test version of the NHS's contact tracing app was released.
The app was trialled on the Isle of Wight.
Matthew Gould, CEO of NHSX, the government department responsible for the app, said the data would be accessible to other organisations for legitimate public health reasons, but could not list which.
Faculty, a company linked to Cambridge Analytica and Palantir, also linked to Cambridge Analytica, worked on the app.
The data collected would be handled according to the data access regulations and would be held in a centralised repository.
Over 150 of the UK's security and privacy experts warned the app's data could be used by 'a bad actor (state, private sector, or hacker)' to spy on citizens.
Fears were discussed by the House of Commons' Human Rights Select Committee about plans for the app to record user location data.
Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights said the app should not be released without proper privacy protections.
The Scottish government said they would not recommend the app until they could be confident it would work and would be secure.
The functionality of the app was also questioned as the software's use of Bluetooth required the app to be constantly running, meaning users could not use other apps or lock their device if the app was to function efficiently.
Digital inclusion advocates told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in May that there was a digital divide with the app, with many people missing out due to not having access to the Internet or having poor IT skills.
The advocates said that 64% of the population who had not used the Internet were over the age of 65, and that 63% of the population who did not know how to open an app were under the age of 65.
It was reported by the Financial Times that a second app was in development using technology from Apple and Google.
The digital skills advocacy group
FutureDotNow is running a campaign to provide connectivity to excluded households.
On 18 June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced development would switch to the Apple/Google system after admitting that Apple's restrictions on usage of Bluetooth prevented the app from working effectively.
On 30 July 2020, the Northern Ireland Executive launched the StopCOVID NI app based on the Republic of Ireland app developed by Nearform which uses the Apple/Google Exposure Notification system.
The app interoperates with the Republic of Ireland version of the app.
The COVID Symptom Study app is an independent initiative led by Professor Tim Spector of King's College, London and endorsed by the Scottish, Irish and Northern Ireland governments but not the UK government.
It was released on the App Store and Google Play on 24 March, and as of 18 September had 4,214,516 contributors who had downloaded the app.

It shows the estimated current active infections by local council areas updated daily.

Research and innovation ==


===
Biological research ===
UK Research and Innovation also announced £20 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and to test the viability of existing drugs to treat the virus.
The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium will deliver large-scale, rapid whole genome sequencing of the virus that causes the disease and £260 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to support vaccine development.
In April, the UK Government launched a task force to help develop and roll out a coronavirus vaccine.
A University of Edinburgh led study in to whether specific genes cause a predisposition into the effects that COVID-19 had on people began in
May. The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, studied whether sniffer dogs could detect coronavirus in humans.
Following research by King's College London of symptoms from 1.5 million suspected cases, "loss of taste or smell" was added to the NHS symptoms list.

=== Design and innovation ===
In March 2020, the government asked manufacturers in the UK to help in the production of respiratory devices to help fight COVID-19.
Innovate UK announced £20 million funding for innovative businesses.
The Formula One teams and manufacturers based in the UK linked up to form "Project Pitlane".
A group of engineers from Mercedes and University College London, along with staff from University College Hospital, designed and made a product known as UCL-Ventura breathing aid, which is a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the second model of the device.
The UK Government put an order in for 10,000 devices.
Mercedes made the drawings for the device available for free to help other countries fight COVID-19.
On 16 April the MHRA approved the Penlon Prima ESO2, design which was part of the stream known as VentilatorChallengeUK.
The UK government ordered 15,000 of these devices.
A consortium of aerospace companies including Airbus, Meggitt, and GKN worked on scaling up production of an existing design.
In April this design was approved by the MHRA and an order for 15,000 units was placed.
Other designs by JCB, Dyson and BlueSky were not taken forward.
Eight other designs had their support ended by the UK government.
A CPAP device, known as a Covid emergency ventilator, designed by Dr Rhys Thomas, a consultant anaesthetist at Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen, was given the go-ahead by the Welsh Government.
The machine, designed in a few days was used on a patient in mid-March, and subsequently funded by the Welsh Government.
In early April, it was approved by the MHRA.
Production is by CR Clarke & Co in Betws, Carmarthenshire.
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) produced a reusable visor with the first deliveries just before Easter, and shared the designs to allow wider manufacture.
The Royal Mint manufactured medical visors for medical staff working during the pandemic.

===
Clinical trials ===
As of December 2020, clinical trials of five coronavirus vaccine candidates have been conducted in the UK:
Oxford-AstraZeneca AZD1222, Imperial College London
LNP-nCoVsaRNA, Novavax NVX-CoV2373, Janssen Pharmaceutica Ad26.COV2.S, and Valneva SE
VLA2001.
== Impacts ==


===
Economic ===
The pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy of the United Kingdom, with most sectors and workforces adversely affected.
Some temporary shutdowns became permanent; some people who were furloughed were later made redundant.

The economic disruption has had a significant impact on people's mental health—with particular damage to the mental health of foreign-born men whose work hours have been reduced/eliminated.

===
Social ===
The pandemic has had far-reaching consequences in the country that go beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, cultural, and social implications.

===
Spread to other countries and territories ===
Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, tested positive for COVID-19 upon her return from WE Day events in the UK; on 12 March 2020
the Trudeau family entered two weeks of self-isolation.
The first patient in Mauritius was a 59-year-old man who returned from the United Kingdom on 7 March 2020.
When he arrived in Mauritius, the Mauritian had no symptoms.
Other cases of the novel coronavirus resulting from travel to the UK were subsequently reported in India and Nigeria.
On 16 June, it was widely reported in British media that New Zealand's first COVID-19 cases in 24 days were diagnosed in two British women, both of whom had travelled from the UK and were given special permission to visit a dying parent.
The women had entered the country on 7 June, after first flying into Doha and Brisbane.

=== Anti-lockdown protests ===
On 29 August 2020, thousands of protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square objecting to the continuation and extension of COVID-19 restrictions.
The event included speakers such as conspiracy theorists David Icke and Piers Corbyn.
Police urged demonstrators to disperse under social distancing laws, advising them in a distributed leaflet that they may be committing a criminal offence.

On 2 July 2020, case data from pillars 1 and 2 of the testing programme (swab testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers; and swab testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance) were combined and de-duplicated, resulting in a step decrease in the cumulative number of cases reported.

' * ' Values for these dates questionable in light of announcements of 3 and 4 October: Following under-reporting due to a 'technical issue' between 25 September and 1 October, 15,841 additional cases were reported on 3 and 4 October.
The error was caused by a limit on the number of columns in an Excel spreadsheet.

' x ' Values for these dates questionable in light of announcement of 16 December: Public Health Wales announced that there had been a delay in transferring data from the Lighthouse Labs which had resulted in under-reporting over the preceding week of approximately 11,000 positive tests.
The 'missing' numbers were reported instead on 16 December.
Warning: the values in the above graph are not directly comparable between different time periods because they were measured under different testing rates.
It is therefore vital to consult Test positivity rate and New daily tests, and to understand the strategy for selection of subjects for testing.

===
Vaccination statistics ===
As of 8 January 2021, three vaccines are authorised in the UK:
the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

All of these vaccines require two doses.
The upper line shows cumulative first doses and the lower line shows cumulative second doses.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson assured on 21 February 2021 that all adults in the UK will be vaccinated by the end of July 2021.

Data is from GOV.UK.

==
Demographics ==
Statistics suggest that certain groups in British society have been particularly affected by the pandemic both medically and by the impact of lockdown.

===
Coronavirus risk and ethnicity ===
In April 2020, the British Medical Association called on the government to investigate if
and why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups were more vulnerable to COVID-19, after the first 10 doctors to die were all from the group.
The Labour Party called for a public enquiry after the first 10 deaths in the health service were from BAME backgrounds.
The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan wrote to the Equality and Human Rights Commission asking them to investigate whether the effects of coronavirus on BAME groups could have been prevented or mitigated.
A group of 70 BAME figures sent a letter to Boris Johnson calling for an independent public enquiry into the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.
Research by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre concluded that people from BAME backgrounds made up 34% of critical patients.
NHS England and Public Health England were appointed to lead an inquiry into why people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds appear to be disproportionately affected by coronavirus.
On 18 April, Public Health England said that they would start recording the ethnicity of victims of coronavirus.
Research carried out by The Guardian newspaper concluded that ethnic minorities in England when compared to white people were dying in disproportionately high numbers.
They said that deaths in hospitals up to 19 April 19% were from BAME backgrounds who make up only 15% of the population of England.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS), meanwhile, wrote that in England and Wales black men were four times more likely to die from coronavirus than white men, from figures gathered between 2 March to 10 April.
They concluded that "the difference between ethnic groups in COVID-19 mortality is partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained".

Some commentators including Dr. John Campbell have pointed to Vitamin D deficiency as a possible cause of the discrepancy, but the theory remains unproven.
Another study carried out by University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on behalf of NHS England and a separate report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies corroborated the ONS' findings.
An Oxford University led study into the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy concluded that 55% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus from 1 March to 14 April were from a BAME background.
The study also concluded that BAME women were four times more likely to be hospitalised than white women.
A study by Public Health Scotland found no link between BAME groups and COVID-19.

A second Public Health England study found that those with a Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white Britons.

Other BAME groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death from COVID-19.
===
Fines and ethnicity ===
Figures from the Metropolitan Police showed that BAME people received proportionally more fines than white people for breaching COVID-related restrictions.

===
Coronavirus risk and employment status ===
The ONS study, using data collected up to 17 April 2020 across England and Wales, concluded that men in low-skilled jobs were four times more likely to die from the virus than those in professional jobs.
Women who worked as carers were twice as likely to die than those who worked in technical or professional jobs.
The GMB trade union commented on the findings that ministers must stop any return to work until "proper guidelines, advice and enforcement are in place to keep people safe".
An analysis of the figures by The Guardian concluded that deaths were higher in occupations where physical distancing was more difficult to achieve.
Analysis by The Independent and the Financial Times concluded that mortality rates from coronavirus were higher in deprived and urban areas than in prosperous and rural locations, across England and Wales.
Analysis of the ONS data by the Guardian also concluded that by 13 May, only about 12% of people who had died from the virus in England and Wales were under 65 while 59% were over 80.
A Public Health England report in June 2020 found that security guards, taxi and bus drivers, construction workers and social care staff were at a higher risk of COVID-19 when compared to other occupations.

===
Unemployment by age ===
One of the demographics most severely affected by the increase in unemployment during the pandemic was the youngest members of the working-aged population.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that 174,000 fewer 16- to 24-year-olds were employed in July to September 2020 than during the preceding three months.
Their statistics also suggested youth unemployment as a percentage had increased more sharply than among the general population reaching 14.6% by November 2020.
The pandemic also appeared to have hurried many of the oldest workers' exit from employment: data collected by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in June and July 2020 showed that 6% of those aged 66–70 and 11% of those aged 71 and older who were working immediately before the crises had now retired, half of whom had not previously planned to do so.

United Kingdom government statistics
Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which infect amphibians, birds, and mammals.
The group includes the subfamilies Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae; the members of the latter are known as coronaviruses.

The viral genome is 26–32 kilobases in length.
The particles are typically decorated with large (~20 nm), club- or petal-shaped surface projections (the "peplomers" or "spikes"), which in electron micrographs of spherical particles create an image reminiscent of the solar corona.

==
Virology ==
The 5' and 3' ends of the genome have a cap and poly(A) tract, respectively.
The viral envelope, obtained by budding through membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi apparatus, invariably contains two virus-specified (glyco)protein species, S and M. Glycoprotein
S comprises the large surface projections, while M is a triple-spanning transmembrane protein.
Toroviruses and a select subset of coronaviruses (in particular the members of subgroup A in the genus Betacoronavirus) possess, in addition to the peplomers composed of S, a second type of surface projections composed of the hemagglutinin-esterase protein.
Another important structural protein is the phosphoprotein N, which is responsible for the helical symmetry of the nucleocapsid that encloses the genomic RNA.Genetic recombination can occur when at least two viral genomes are present in the same infected host cell.

RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in coronavirus evolution.

Recombination can determine genetic variability within a CoV species, the capability of a CoV species to jump from one host to another and, infrequently, the emergence of a novel
CoV.
The exact mechanism of recombination in CoVs is not known, but likely involves template switching during genome replication.

==
Taxonomy ==
The family Coronaviridae is organized in 2 sub-families, 5 genera, 26 sub-genera, and 46 species.
Additional species are pending or tentative.

Orthocoronavirinae
Letovirinae
Alphaletovirus

===
Coronavirus ===
Coronavirus is the common name for Coronaviridae and Orthocoronavirinae, also called Coronavirinae.
Coronaviruses cause diseases in mammals and birds.
In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections, including the common cold, which are typically mild, though rarer forms such as SARS (including the one causing COVID-19) and MERS can be lethal.
Symptoms vary in other species: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory disease, while in cows and pigs coronaviruses cause diarrhea.
Other than for SARS-CoV-2, there no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.
The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, among the largest for an RNA virus (second only to a 41-kb nidovirus recently discovered in planaria).

The COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal is part of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
On 2 March 2020, the virus was confirmed to have reached the country when it was reported that two men, a 60-year-old doctor who travelled to the north of Italy on vacation and a 33-year-old man working in Spain, tested positive for COVID-19.As of 29 April 2021, a total of 836,033 confirmed cases, 795,326 recoveries, and 16,974 deaths have been reported in the country.

==
Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

==
Timeline ==


===
2020 ===
==== March ====
March 2: The first two  recorded cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Portugal.

March 12: The Portuguese government declared the highest level of alert because of COVID-19 and said it would be maintained until 9 April.
Portugal entered a Mitigation Phase as Community transmission was detected.

March 18:
The President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, declared the entirety of the Portuguese territory in a State of Emergency for the following fifteen days, with the possibility of renewal, the first since the Carnation Revolution in 1974.

March 24
: The Portuguese Government admitted that the country could not contain the virus any longer.

March 26: The country entered the "Mitigation Stage".
The health care sites dedicated to fighting the disease started including the Portugal Health centres groups (agrupamentos de centros de saúde, ACES).

====
April ====
April 2: The Parliament approved the extension of the State of Emergency, as requested by the President.
The State of Emergency will remain until 17 April, subject to further extensions of similar duration.
Under the new regulations, for the Easter celebrations, from 9 April
(Maundy Thursday) to 13 April (Easter Monday)
the Portuguese Government decreed special measures in restricting people movements between municipalities (Portuguese: municípios or concelhos) with very few exceptions, closing all airports to civil transportation and increased control in the national borders.

April 30:
The Portuguese Ministers' Council approved a plan to start releasing the country from the COVID-19 container measures and cancelling the State of Emergency.

====
May ====
May 2:
The State of Emergency was canceled.

May 4
: Portugal started the first phase in easing restrictions.
Small street stores reopened (see Response, Return to Normal section).

May 18
: Portugal entered the second phase in easing restrictions.
Nurseries and the last two years of the secondary school reopened, along with restaurants, cafés, medium-sized street stores and some museums, all with mandatory usage of mask and distance rules.

==== September
====
September 15
:  "state of alert" to nationwide "state of contingency".
The decision is thought to prepare the country for the return of students and teachers for the new academic year, the return of workers into the workplace from months of work-from-home policies and for the possible surge of new cases due to the beginning of fall and winter.
The following measures were adopted:Mandatory domiciliary or hospital confinement for people infected with COVID-19 or subject to active health surveillance.

Prohibition of gatherings with more than 10 people.

===
Information access ===
Information about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the country is hosted on the DGS home website.
However, due to the severity of the pandemic a separate website was created dedicated specifically to coronavirus information and updates under the Portuguese Ministry of Health.
Another governmental website was later created to deal with more generic information explaining the emergency status, public information and exceptional measures to help business.
The Ministry of Health provides a web page with information for the public about different areas, including brochures, orientation and guidance for different activity sectors, how to deal with self-isolation, and quarantine games for children.
As an example there are several Portuguese food recipes with canned food.

Hospitals for COVID-19 ===
The following is a list of the front line COVID-19 hospitals.

=== Return to normal ===
On April 30, 2020 the Portuguese Ministers' Council approved a plan to start releasing the country from COVID-19 containment measures and cancel the State of Emergency.
The plan was divided in three stages, beginning respectively on 4 May, 18 May and 1 June, 2020.

The first stage eased some restrictions, such as:

Barbers and hair salons are open but with health restrictions, mask usage and only by appointment
Small shops with less than 200m2 can open but cannot have more than 5 customers/100m2 and all must use masks
People can use public transportation if they aren't able to work remotely.

All public services are open to everyone with an appointment and is an obligation the use of a mask
Physical exercise can only be done outdoors or at home
Libraries and Archives are
open
Groups of more than 10 people aren't allowed


==
Impact ==
Due to movement restrictions imposed by the state of emergency started in March 18 and the adoption of government guidelines on social distancing by the Portuguese people, otherwise highly populated streets and destinations in cities like Lisbon and Porto were completely empty.

=== LGBT+ youth ===
A study by the Faculdade de Psicologia e de Ciências da Educação da Universidade do Porto (FPCEUP) aimed at “assessing the psychological health and social support networks” of LGBT+ young people who live with their parental figures during the COVID-19 pandemic concluded, based on a survey of 632 young LGBT+ people, who most did not feel comfortable in their families during confinement.
Of the people surveyed, 59% said they were uncomfortable in the family and three out of 10 felt “quite uncomfortable” living at home with parents during social confinement.
In addition, 35% of young people felt “suffocated” because they were unable to express their identity within the family, whereas in the case of young people whose family was aware of their identity, 35% stated that they “deal badly or very badly" thereby.
This study, with a longitudinal and intercultural character, also concluded that six out of 10 participants considered that the pandemic had “greatly” affected their lives.
With regard to social support networks, half of the young people admitted to feeling isolated from their friends and 35% "extremely isolated" from their partners.
“As for the present study, if for some young people
the covid-19 pandemic had no impact on their social support networks, an important proportion felt quite isolated from their friends”, says FPCEUP.

== Vaccine donations to former colonies ==
Portugal announced that it would distribute 5% of its vaccine doses to a group of former colonies in Africa and to the nation of East Timor.
Portugal is entitled to 35 million vaccine doses in 2021.
Donating 5% of its stock means the country would give 1.75 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, and East Timor.
So far, they have committed to donate 1 million doses starting in July.

Holiday chalets were being prepared as quarantine centres.
Some of these chalets had served as quarantine centres in previous outbreaks, such as the 2003 SARS outbreak and 2009 flu pandemic.
Measures such as temperature screening and quarantine facilities were put in place at foreign worker dormitories.
Transportation companies like ComfortDelGro, SMRT and private hire operators have since taken more precautions against the virus with hand sanitisers, disinfectants and masks provided.
Advisories were also distributed.

On the same day, a Scoot flight was delayed in Hangzhou for six hours after one passenger was sent for further testing, causing passengers and crew to be quarantined.
The flight returned with Singaporeans three days later.

Some hospitals have discouraged children from visiting.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was confirmed to have spread to Bangladesh in March 2020.
The first three known cases were reported on 8 March 2020 by the country's epidemiology institute, IEDCR.
Since then, the pandemic has spread day by day over the whole nation and the number of affected people has been increasing.

In order to protect the population, the government declared "lockdown" throughout the nation from 23 March to 30 May and prepared some necessary steps to spread awareness to keep this syndrome away from them.
Infections remained low until the end of March but saw a steep rise in April.

In the week ending on 11 April, new cases in Bangladesh grew by 1,155 percent, the highest in Asia, ahead of Indonesia, with 186 percent.

On 6 May, cases were confirmed in all districts.
Rangamati was the last district to report confirmed cases of COVID-19.
On 13 June, the number of cases in Bangladesh exceeded the number of cases in China, the country where the outbreak began.
Bangladesh reached two grim milestones of 160,000 cases and 2,000 deaths on 5 July and overtook France in terms of the number of cases two days later.
The number of recoveries in the country exceeded the number of active cases on 12 July.

Bangladesh is the third most affected country in South Asia, after India and Pakistan.
Medical experts feared that not enough tests were being conducted.
Newspaper reports and social media continued to report about additional deaths of patients with COVID-19 symptoms.
Some of the deceased were treated at COVID-19 isolation centres at hospitals in the districts and others were denied treatment, though no tests were conducted to confirm contagion.
For a long time, testing was centralised to only Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in the capital Dhaka, although patients with symptoms were reported all around the country.
On 22 March, Bangladesh declared a 10-day shut down effective from 26 March to 4 April.
This was later extended to 30 May.
A series of hotline numbers, email address and the Facebook page of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) are provided for people to contact if they suspect COVID-19 infection or need more information.

==
Background ==
On 31 December 2019, China reported to the WHO cases of pneumonia with unknown causes.
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.
Bangladesh faces significant challenges in combating COVID-19 as it is a densely populated country and also houses a million stateless Rohingya refugees in sprawling refugee camps that are conducive to the spread of epidemics.
It also has significant migrant populations living in Italy, a COVID-affected country.

==
Timeline ==


===
January ===
On 22 January, the authorities at the Dhaka airport put the airports on alert by screening travellers from China.

=== February ===
On 1 February, a special flight from Bangladesh evacuated 312 Bangladeshi citizens stranded in Wuhan.

The evacuees were quarantined for 14 days at the Ashkona Hajj Camp in Dhaka and other locations.
None of them tested positive for the coronavirus.

=== March ===
On 8 March, the first three coronavirus cases were confirmed.
They included two men that recently returned from Italy and a female relative.
On the same day, the government decided to scale down the grand ceremony planned for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's birth centenary on 17 March.
On 15 March 142 passengers returned from Italy, who were also taken to the Ashkona Hajj camp.
After they complained about the unsanitary conditions there, many of them were allowed to go home with advice to self-isolate.
Health experts expressed serious reservations about the action.
On 18 March, Bangladesh reported its first coronavirus death.
The patient was aged over 70 and had other morbidities.
By the end of March Bangladesh had reported 51 confirmed cases and five deaths.
The government imposed "general holiday" (i.e. general lock-down) came into effect on 26 March, it was announced on 23 March and initially stated to be in place until 4 April.

=== April ===
The "general holiday" (lockdown) due to end on 4 April was extended to April 11, then to April 14, then to April 25 and then again to May 5.

Bangladesh crossed the figure of 100 confirmed cases on 6 April and 1,000 confirmed cases on 14 April.
On 20 April, the number of confirmed deaths crossed 100.

===
May ===
The "general holiday' (lockdown) was extended to May 7, then to May 16 and finally to May 30, with the government announcing on May 27
there will be no further extension.
On the topic of easing the lockdown measures, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said "Economic activities have to be resumed for the sake of the lives and livelihoods of people.
Most countries of the world have already been compelled to relax shutdown because it is not possible to restrict people's source of income for an indefinite period.
And it is not at all possible for a developing country like Bangladesh too."
=== June ===
On June 18, the number of confirmed cases crossed 100,000 (one lakh) people.

=== July ===
On July 18, the number of confirmed cases crossed 200,000 (two lakh) people.

==
Government response ==
It was widely argued in the national media to declare proclamation of emergency although the Sheikh Hasina government pragmatically handled the COVID-19 situation within the constitutional scheme of normal times.

===
Social distancing measures ===
On 23 March, when Bangladesh had 33 confirmed cases, the government declared a ten-day nationwide holiday for the period 26 March – 4 April, ordering all public and private offices to be closed, with the exception for emergency services.
People have been asked to practice social distancing and stay at home.
Public transport would be limited and advice was given to avoid them.
The measure has been described as a "lockdown" by the media, albeit a "relaxed" one.
The government asked the Army to ensure social distancing.
ABC News Australia reported that 290 teams of soldiers were deployed across the country, that streets were empty in the capital Dhaka and the roadside shops were closed.
It also said that thousands of people left Dhaka for their home villages.
The "general holiday" (lockdown) was extended several times throughout April and May, until officially ceasing on 30 May 2020.
Ending the lockdown appears to have been primarily driven by concerns regarding its economic impact, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina saying "Economic activities have to be resumed for the sake of the lives and livelihoods of people.
Most countries of the world have already been compelled to relax shutdown because it is not possible to restrict people's source of income for an indefinite period.
And it is not at all possible for a developing country like Bangladesh too.
"On
9 April, Bangladesh imposed a 'complete lockdown' on the Cox's Bazar District where the majority of the Rohingya refugee camps are located.
"
No entry, no exit – until the situation improves", said the government directive.

The final set of restrictions on public movement were officially lifted on 1 September.
These restrictions had included prohibiting movement outdoors from 10 PM to 5 AM (except in case of emergencies), the closure of all shops, bazaars and malls after 8 PM and the prohibition of meetings, rallies and mass gatherings (which had come into effect from 4 August).
The Road Transport and Bridges Ministry had also announced on 29 August that the restrictions on buses, which had hitherto directed buses to run below seat capacity and charge higher fares to passengers, would end.
A number of health experts expressed their concern at the news.
Virologist Dr Nazrul Islam, member of the National Technical Advisory Committee for COVID-19 and former VC of BSMMU, said "the disease transmission rate should be under 5%, but till now the daily positive cases rate is still 15.97% and on Monday it was around 17%.
So, it can be said that the time for lifting restrictions has not yet arrived."
And Professor Muzaherul Huq, a former adviser of World Health Organization's South East Asia region, told The Daily Star newspaper that "lifting of restrictions from public transport was a risky move ... if the physical distancing is relaxed in public transport, transmission would definitely rise."
===
Repatriation of Bangladeshi citizens ===
On 31 January, a special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines with special quarantine, three physicians, a nurse, and required medical equipment on board flew to Wuhan, China to evacuate stranded Bangladeshi citizens.
On 1 February 312 Bangladeshi citizens (297 were adults and 15 children) stranded in Wuhan, China were evacuated and brought back to Bangladesh.
Most of the Bangladeshis were students and PhD researchers at different universities in the Hubei province in China where their provincial government launched multiple screening tests before allowing them to get on board the plane.
Majority of the evacuees were quarantined for 14 days at the Hajj Camp in Ashkona in Dhaka and some at the Combined Military Hospital before being released two weeks later.
None of these returnees from Wuhan China were tested positive for coronavirus.

=== Travel and entry restrictions ===
On 22 January, the authorities at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) in Dhaka reported that they had put the airports on alert to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Bangladesh by screening travelers from China, where the virus had at that time infected nearly 300 people and killed six people.
The airport claimed to turn on its thermal scanner to scan passengers to detect any infection in passengers traveling from China.
A.H.M.
Touhid-ul Ahsan, director of the main Shahjalal International Airport, said doctors at the airport would look for fevers, coughs, breathing difficulties and sore throats.
The country's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research were to be notified of any passengers with symptoms for further examination, he said.
On 2 February, the government of Bangladesh decided to suspend on-arrival visas for Chinese visitors.
The Chittagong port also announced that as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus from the ships that bring goods from around the world, the port health officer would examine all sailors of the ships coming from the East Asian countries.
On 14 March, on-arrival visas were suspended for all countries, and flights from all European countries other than the United Kingdom were stopped.

This reportedly increased tourist traffic at the beaches in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar, counteracting the government measure.
International flights began to resume from Dhaka airport on 16 June 2020, with only Qatar Airways and Biman Bangladesh Airlines initially permitted to fly.
On 24 June, Emirates resumed flights to Dhaka, on a reduced capacity.

===
Recovery ===
On 3 May, according to new guidelines, the total number of recoveries in Bangladesh crossed 1,000 marks by surging sharply.
In the beginning of June, over 10,000 coronavirus patients recovered so far.
Two weeks later, on 15 June, the first day of monsoon, Bangladesh reported over 15,000 recoveries, the highest jump in the total number of recoveries in the country, taking it to 34,027.
The total number of recoveries crossed 40,000 marks on 18 June and 50,000 one week later.
At the beginning of July, the number of patients who have recovered from the coronavirus disease crossed 60,000 marks.
Three days later, the number of recoveries from the coronavirus disease crossed 70,000 marks.
On 8 July, the number of recoveries crossed 80,000 marks before exceeding the number of active cases.
The number of people who have recovered from the disease crossed 90,000 marks on 12 July and 100,000 two days later.
As of 14 July, there are now over 100,000 patients who have recovered from the coronavirus disease.
The number of recoveries in Bangladesh exceeded the number of recoveries in France on 7 July and the number of recoveries in China one day later.
The country also reported more than 50,000 new recoveries from 16 June to 9 July.

The recovery rate in Bangladesh was very low until
early May. The recovery rate in the country improved sharply to about 11% on 3 May and kept improving over time.
The recovery rate improved sharply again to nearly 38% in the middle of June.
As of 12 July, the recovery rate is over 50%, which means that more than half of all patients have recovered from the disease.
The recovery rate in Bangladesh exceeded the recovery rate in France on 7 July.
Five days later, the recovery rate exceeded 50%.

===
Transmission rate ===
In March and April 2020, the COVID-19 transmission rate in Bangladesh was around 2, which meant that two people could be infected with the virus from one person.
However, the transmission rate of COVID-19 in the country fell as time passed.
As of 26 June, the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease in the country is 1.05, which is a very good sign.
Model-based simulations suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number was below 1.0 and falling from December 2020 to February
2021.Health Minister Zahid Malik said that the situation in Bangladesh improved as the growth rate of infections slowed down and the doubling period of infections got longer and that the minimum number of COVID-19 tests performed daily in the country was also improved to 15,000.
He also said that, on 3 July, the maximum growth rate of infections in the country fell to 2.5% the day after the number of COVID-19 cases exceeded 150,000.
As of 3 July, Bangladesh sees a growth rate of infections less than 2.5%.
The health minister said that, until 10 July, the minimum doubling period of infections in the country was improved to 25 days.
As of 10 July, the number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh takes more than 25 days to double.

===
Curve flattening ===
Malik announced that Bangladesh started flattening the coronavirus curve on 23 June as thousands of tests were performed every day in the country to improve the situation and that the coronavirus curve flattened on the last eight days of June and the first six days of July.
He also believed that excessive testing in Bangladesh caused the COVID-19 curve to flatten.
Malik said that the curve flattened again after decreasing for six days.
On 26 June, three days after the curve started flattening, a record of 18,498 samples was tested in the country, which was above the minimum number of tests performed every day.

Some health experts believed that Bangladesh succeeded in flattening the curve, slowing down the growth rate of infections and extending the doubling period of infections.
They also said that excessive testing in the country improved the situation, slowed down the growth rate of infections and extended the doubling period of infections.
The coronavirus curve in Bangladesh stopped increasing on 23 June and started decreasing two weeks later.
On 13 July, the curve flattened again.
As of 13 July, the COVID-19 curve in the country is flattening for another time.
On 27 June, which was four days after the curve stopped increasing, there were more than 700,000 samples tested in the country.

===
Fighting disinformation ===
Some people have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic.
According to Human Rights Watch, "Since mid-March 2020, the authorities have apparently arrested at least a dozen people, including a doctor, opposition activists, and students, for their comments about coronavirus, most of them under the draconian Digital Security Act.
"But
disinformation does not affect the whole of society equally, since women in this country are less likely to receive information about COVID-19 than men.
The reasons that prevent women from being well informed about the pandemic are their difficulty in owning a mobile phone and accessing the Internet, as well as their low level of education.
However, it is crucial that they have access to accurate and reliable information about the coronavirus, as they are the ones in charge of promoting hygiene in the household.

===
April 2021 lockdown ===
On 5 April 2021 a seven-day lockdown was announced by the Bangladeshi government, including all domestic travel suspended and shopping malls shut alongside a curfew between 6pm and 6am.
This followed a record new 7, 087 new COVID-19 cases on 4 April, coinciding with a near-doubling of their testing rate from mid-March into the start of April.
Some protests against this lockdown occurred in Dhaka, while the local media also criticised the lacklustre and inconsistent enforcement of lockdown rules throughout the country.
Some schools continued to hold classes during the week.
On 6 April, merchant groups held protests in the capital, demanding an end to the lockdown, and the safe reopening of shops, by following hygiene guidelines.
On 7 April, public transport resumed in all metropolitan areas of the country, including Dhaka, after two days of closure.
On 9 April, markets and stores were officially reopened throughout the country, although many were unofficially open earlier in the week.
The closures led to more crowded markets than before, and higher prices, as customers flocked to stores to buy needed goods before Ramadan.
On 12 April, the government declared that from 14 to 21 April, commercial banks will be closed, except for foreign exchange banks near port areas.
Public transportation will again be closed, as well as government offices.
However, emergency services, including garment factories and other industries, will remain open.
The Bangladesh Police are implementing movement passes, which must be issued from their web site to leave your home, including for jobs, grocery purchases or medical needs.
If used for commuting, two passes must be issued to go and return.
A photograph of the applicant must be uploaded, as well as identification papers, reason for travel, and dates and times.
On 14 April, it was reported that police checkpoints were checking those in vehicles for movement passes, but those on foot were allowed to pass.
On 17 April, markets were reopening in Barisal, sometimes only unofficially in alleyways.
On 28 April, the lockdown period will end, prioritizing livelihoods over what has been a mild illness in Bangladesh, with some of the lowest death rates in the world.
The country will reopen in accordance with hygiene.

==
Testing and monitoring ==


===
Testing ===
Bangladesh has consistently shown one of the lowest test rates per capita in the world and concerns that the level of testing have been insufficient to accurately understand the spread of infection have often been aired.

The number of daily tests reached heights of approximately 18,000 by the end of June, but then began to rapidly decline in July (with typical numbers in the range of 10,000 to 14,000 per day throughout July and August).
A change in government policy was cited as the cause for the decline, following the introduction of a charge for tests (which had hitherto been free in government facilities) announced on June 29 and requirements for a doctor's referral for a test.
The number of samples tested in Bangladesh exceeded 100,000 on
7 May. Less than two weeks later, the number of samples tested in the country exceeded 200,000.
At the end of May, there were over 300,000 samples tested.
On 8 June, more than 400,000 samples were tested in Bangladesh.
The number of samples tested exceeded 500,000 six days later.
On 21 June, there were more than 600,000 samples tested.
The number of samples tested exceeded 700,000 on 27 June and 800,000 five days later.
On 9 July, the number of samples tested in the country exceeded 900,000.
On 17 July 2020, the number of tests conducted to date crossed the threshold of one million samples.

==
Treatment and vaccinations ==


===
Treatment ===
Bangladesh has 1,169 ICU beds, amounting to 0.72 beds per 100,000 citizens.
Of these 432 beds are in government hospitals and 737 in private hospitals.
There are only 550 ventilators in the country.
On 21 March, the IEDCR announced that 150 ICU beds would be made available for COVID treatment in Dhaka and more would be provided in other parts of Bangladesh.
By 8 April, it was reported that 112 ICU beds were available, of which 79 were in Dhaka, 26 in Mymensingh, 5 in Khulna and 2 in Sylhet.
The government was in the process of procuring 380 ventilators.
There were also 7,693 isolated beds around the country.

===
Vaccine trials and vaccinations ===
On 21 June, China invited Bangladesh to get priority access to COVID-19 vaccine once it is developed.
On 26 June, the Chinese government announced that they might perform second-phase clinical trials of the vaccine in Bangladesh.

The Chinese government also believed that the coronavirus vaccine, if developed, might be given to Bangladesh by August as the priority.
In the middle of 2020, Bangladesh started developing the coronavirus vaccine.

In July 2020, Sinovac Biotech was given approval by the Bangladesh Medical Research Council to begin a third-phase trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.
The Bangladesh government later decided to cancel the trial of the vaccine.

On 5 November 2020, a tripartite agreement was signed between the government of Bangladesh, the Serum Institute of India, and Beximco Pharma of Bangladesh.
Under the agreement Bangladesh ordered 30 million doses of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine from Serum through Beximco for $4 per shot.
On the other hand, Indian government has given 3.2 million doses to Bangladesh as a gift which were also produced by Serum.
But Serum supplied only 7 million doses from the tripartite agreement in the first two months of the year.
Bangladesh was supposed to receive 5 million doses per month  but not received shipments in March and April.
As a result, rollout of vaccine  has been disrupted by supply shortfalls.
Most people who have received the first dose are not getting the second dose on time.
Not getting the second dose at the right time is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the vaccination program.
In addition, several citizens of Bangladesh have expressed doubts about its effectiveness and  safety.
Bangladesh is looking for alternative vaccine sources because India isn't supplying the vaccine according to the timeline of the deal.
In 28 April 2021 Govt.
approves the proposal to local procution of Russian Sputnik V, Chinese Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccines.
Bangladesh regulatory body approves the emergency use of Sputnik V on 27 April and Sinopharm vaccine on 29 April.

Impacts ==


===
Economic ===
The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted household and individual level earnings in Bangladesh with around 13 percent of people have become unemployed, being women in informal employment more likely than men to see their working hours reduced; lower and middle-income classes have been experiencing a significant drop in income for the last few months.

Consequently, the disposable income of the country people is following a declining trend.
Meanwhile, the national poverty is forecasted to increase by 25.13 percent,
claimed by Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on almost all sectors of the economy, inter alia, most notably, it has caused a reduction of exports by 16.93 percent, imports by 17 percent, and also a decline of average revenue for all small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 66 percent in 2020 compared to 2019.
Exceptionally, only remittance inflow has seen an 11 percent increase this year.
Even though garment factories were allowed to continue operating under the country's lockdown, an estimated one million garment workers, or one-quarter of the workforce, were laid off due to declining orders for export.
On 5 April, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced a stimulus package amounting to some US$8bn.

===
Education ===
Bangladesh has approximately 200,000 educational institutions across the country and over 40 million students.
In March, Bangladesh closed all of its educational institutions in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Initially on 17 March, when Bangladesh had 8 confirmed cases, the government announced all schools would be closed for the remainder of March.
Dhaka University was also closed for the same period.
The Education Ministry announced an extension of the closures to April 9.
However, with the situation not improving Dhaka University announced on 9 April it would remain closed indefinitely.
With educational intuitions still closed by the end of April, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced that they could remain closed until September 2020, unless the situation improves.
On June 14, the ministry of education officially extended school closures to August 6.
On 27 August a Ministry of Education confirmed schools would remain closed until 3 October.
Dhaka University began online classes in July 2020, as have many other universities and schools.
Experts and students have voiced concerns about accessibility to online classes for many students in Bangladesh; with poorer students, particularly in rural areas, lacking the devices and internet connectivity to participate in their classes.
Some have suggested online classes will only further the "educational divide" whereby the most disadvantaged students (who usually attend public universities on scholarships) will fall behind their peers due to lack of accessibility.
Standardised school examinations have been impacted by the school closures.
The HSC exams, which were scheduled to held in April 2020, were postponed indefinitely.
By August 2020 with schools still closed, there was much uncertainty regarding when, and even if, the JSC exams, PEC exams (which are normally scheduled for November) and HSC exams will be held.
On 24 August it was announced that the PEC exams will not be held, with assessments to be conducted by schools instead.
Then on 27 August it was confirmed that the JSC would not be held either and a circular was issued extending the school closure until 3 October.
Some education experts wanted all the educational institutions of Bangladesh closed until November.
Others wanted all the educational institutions in the country to reopen by October.
The education experts said that all of the educational institutions in Bangladesh will reopen only either if the maximum growth rate of infections is 2% or if the minimum doubling period of infections is 30 days.
They also said that all of the educational institutions in the country will reopen only if the coronavirus curve flattens or decreases.
According to some education experts, all the educational institutions will reopen only either if the maximum number of daily or new cases is 3,000 or if the minimum number of daily or new recoveries is 1,500.
All the educational institutions will reopen only if the minimum recovery rate is 50%, according to other education experts.

===
Transport ===


====
Air travel ====
In March, Bangladesh suspended all flights, both domestic and international, to manage the spread of the virus.
Initially direct flights to the UK and China were exempted from the flight suspensions, but the UK was suspended in April too making China the sole exception.
In the beginning of June, domestic flights resumed on limited scale.
International flights resumed from Dhaka airport on 16 June 2020, with only Qatar Airways and Biman Bangladesh Airlines initially permitted to fly.
Flights to and from the UK resumed on 21 June.
On 24 June, flights to and from the UAE became operational via Emirates.
Flights to and from Saudi Arabia resumed on 3 July.
Nearly two weeks later, flights to and from Turkey resumed.

Presentation of a COVID-19 negative certificate became mandatory for all Bangladeshi nationals wishing to travel abroad from 23 July 2020.
The government stipulated that all passengers must possess a document certifying a negative test result, which had been carried out within 72 hours prior to travel, regardless of destination and airline used.
These tests had to have been carried out at one of 16 specific government-listed testing facilities.
However, in an inter-ministry meeting on 30 July it was announced that the decision had been taken that the certificates will only be required for travelers whose destination country or chosen airline policy requires one.
Domestic airline resumed operations from 1 June 2020, initially with very few passengers.
The CAAB prescribed that all airlines have to keep at least 30 percent seats vacant on each flight to ensure social distancing by keeping a minimum gap of a seat between two passengers, if they are not from the same family, and that the front or the last row of seats on each flight must remain vacant for carrying any passenger who is suspected of carrying the coronavirus.
Also crew are only to provide necessary in-flight services with no food or drink served in flights with an airtime of less than one and half hours.
On 13 September 2020 the restrictions on passenger seating were lifted, with only the requirement to leave two rows vacant for suspected COVID positive passengers remaining.
===
Migrant workers ===
The introduction of lock-down measures, economic declines and reduction in global mobility across the world has severely impacted Bangladeshi migrant workers.
It is thought that around ten million Bangladeshis work overseas, especially across the middle east.
Thousands of these workers have been forced to return to Bangladesh, largely because of job lay-offs.
Kuwait for example has proposed a bill which would see 200,000 of the 350,000 Bangladeshi workers there compelled to leave the Gulf state.
Most of these workers have struggled to find work in Bangladesh on their return, with 70 per cent unemployed according to an International Organization for Migration report published in August 2020.

===
Rohingya refugees ===
At the time of the pandemic Bangladesh was housing over a million Rohingya refugees in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar.
One in ten households in the camps were reported to have at least one individual above the age of five with a chronic illness or disability, increasing the risk of complications or death if they contract COVID-19.
The high population density, poor sanitation facilities and limited access to healthcare in the camps are all conducive to the spread of viral illness such as COVID-19.

On 9 April, Bangladesh imposed a 'complete lockdown' on the camps with "No entry, no exit – until the situation improves", said the government directive.
As of 23 June 2020, 46 Rohingya refugees had tested positive for the virus and five deaths had been confirmed.
As of 7 August 2020, the number of confirmed cases had risen to 78 and the number of deaths to six.
A study by Save the Children and other carried out in May 2020
found that 40 per cent of Rohingya children in the camps expressed being scared of dying of the virus or losing loved ones to it.
"
Children tell us they're scared of dying.
The fear of death or losing a loved one can be very distressing for a child, especially when many have already experienced intense trauma and loss, having been forced from their homes in Myanmar and stuck in a congested refugee camp for the past three years."
said Onno van Manen, Country Director for Save the Children in Bangladesh.
Save the Children announced they were to open a new isolation and treatment centre for COVID-19 patients with a capacity of up to 60 beds.
There are concerns that COVID-19 could be devastating for elderly Rohingya refugees, particularly as in June 2019 Amnesty International had reported that older Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh are often being left behind in the humanitarian response efforts.

===
Expatriate Bangladeshis ===
As of 17 April 2020, news media outlets confirmed that there were 147 Bangladeshis who died from the coronavirus in the United States.

==
Controversies ==


===
Mass gathering ===
On 18 April 2020, during the general lockdown, a massive crowd of an estimated 100,000 people gathered in Sylhet to attend the funeral prayers of Islamic scholar Allama Maulana Zubayer Ahmed Ansari.
Social distancing measures were not observed as crowds reportedly blocked nearly two kilometres of the Dhaka-Sylhet highway.
It was not the only Mass gathering.
Subsequently, massive public gatherings were observed at various political, social and national events.

===
Fake Covid certificates ===
In July 2020, several arrests were made after it emerged that Regent Hospital in Dhaka had issued thousands of fake COVID-19 negative certificates without conducting the testing.
The hospitals had allegedly "carried out 10,500 coronavirus tests, out of which 4,200 were genuine and the rest, 6,300 test reports, were given without conducting tests" according to a RAB spokesperson.
It was estimated that two to three crore Taka (approximately 230,000 to 350,00 USD) may have been made through these illegal activities.
Following a nine-day manhunt, Regent Hospital Chairman Mohammad Shahed was arrested near the Indian border disguised in a burqa.
Regent Hospitals had signed a deal with the DGHS in March to provide COVID-19 testing, despite Regent Hospital's licence having expired in 2014, which was reportedly known to the health services division of the health ministry.

=== Denial of medical treatment ===
Fear of the transmission of COVID-19, particularly in the early months of the outbreak, meant that many patients were turned away from hospitals (private and public), with some dying as a result.
In April 2020 for example, Dhaka University student Suman Chakma died after being denied treatment for lung cancer at several hospitals in Dhaka who feared his symptoms could be COVID-19.
The media reported on several more cases of patients lacking COVID-19 certificates being denied admission to multiple hospitals throughout April, May and June, including that of a five-year-old child hit by a vehicle who died en-route between several hospitals in Chattogram and even the additional secretary to the food ministry, Gautam Aich Sarker, died of a kidney condition after being turned away from several hospitals in Dhaka.
In June 2020, 22 year old nurse Habiba Sultana died after being denied emergency treatment at the hospital she worked at, following a stroke.
She had tested negative for COVID-19, but the document had been misplaced and so her admission was refused, she was finally admitted hours later when the police got involved, but by then she had passed.
The Government took a publicly strong stance against these incidences.
In reference to the case of DU student Suman Chakma, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said of the doctors involved that "They don't deserve to work as doctor or do other jobs.
I think they should be driven out of their jobs," and that "doctors have a duty to perform."
The Health Ministry warned of strict action against hospitals that denied treatment, including the cancellation of licenses, if they violate the order.
The DGHS stated that hospitals should inform them if they fail to admit any suspected COVID-19 patient requesting treatment and that "hospitals violating this order will face legal action".
On 11 May the health ministry issued an order that all private hospitals should keep separate arrangements for suspected coronavirus patients and not to turn away any patients if they have treatment facilities.
The same day, the ministry gave a similar directive to the public hospitals.
On May 24, the ministry issued another order directing all the government and private hospitals with 50 or more beds to make separate arrangements for treating COVID-19 patients.
However, despite these measures cases of patients being denied treatment on the grounds of suspected COVID-19 symptoms continued.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first case in Nepal was confirmed on 23 January 2020 when a 31-year-old student, who had returned to Kathmandu from Wuhan on 9 January, tested positive for the disease.
It was also the first recorded case of COVID-19 in South Asia.
Nepal's first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in Kailali District.
The first death occurred on
14 May. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March 2020, and ended on 21 July 2020.
As of 26 April 2021, the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) has confirmed a total of 303,561 cases, 277,951 recoveries, and 3,176 deaths in the country.
In the meantime, 2,417,417 real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) tests have been performed in 40 laboratories across the country.
The viral disease has been detected in all provinces and districts of the country, with Bagmati Province and Kathmandu being the worst hit province and district respectively.
As for Nepalese abroad, as of 26 July 2020, the Non-Resident Nepali Association has reported a total of 12,667 confirmed cases, 16,190 recoveries, and 161 deaths across 35 countries.
Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness.
Starting in mid-January, Nepal established health-desks at Tribhuvan International Airport as well as on border checkpoints with India.
Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights were suspended.
All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed.
Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being set up across the country.
Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded.
Hospitals have been setting up ICU units and isolation beds.
The SAARC countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region.
India, the United States and Germany increased their support to Nepali health sectors.

The pandemic forced Nepal to cancel the then ongoing Visit Nepal Year 2020 tourism campaign.
The country's economy is expected to be severely affected due to the pandemic's impact on tourism, remittance, manufacturing, construction, and trade.
The World Bank has warned that the pandemic could push about one-third of the country's population below the International Poverty Line (i.e., $1.90 per day).Vaccination for COVID-19 began in Nepal on 27 January 2021.

==
Background ==


===
COVID-19 pandemic ===
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan city, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
As of 29 April 2021, more than 149 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 192 countries and territories, resulting in more than 3.15 million deaths.
More than 86.9 million people have recovered, although there may be a possibility of reinfection.
The case fatality rate was estimated to be 4 percent in China, but varies significantly between countries.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.
Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.

The pandemic has led to severe global economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 63 countries, affecting approximately 47 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online.
Due to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.

=== Nepal ===
Nepal is a landlocked country with China in the northern side and India in the east, west and south.
Nepal shares a 1,414 kilometres (879 mi) border with Tibet Autonomous Region, in the Himalayas.
China is Nepal's second-largest trading partner.
Nepal has an 1,800-km open border with India in the east, west and south.
Nepal lies in South Asia, one of the least developed and most densely populated world regions, that performs poorly in education as well as health care and sanitation metrics.
As such, Nepal was considered one of the highest risk areas for the pandemic, and also one of the least prepared.
However, WHO later re-classified Nepal to less at risk from its initial classification as "Very Vulnerable".
According to The Kathmandu Post, before the pandemic, hospitals in Nepal had few ICU beds (just three in Teku Hospital) which were almost always occupied, with people in critical condition usually having to wait for the beds to become empty.
It reported doctors as saying that it would be next to impossible to admit new patients to ICU as soon as they need them.
Teku Hospital, the only one designated for handling infectious diseases, had built an isolation ward during the avian influenza outbreak a decade ago, but had never brought it into use, as it did not have experts to evaluate or maintain the required standards.
As news of a new infectious disease in China broke, concerns were raised in Nepal over the high potential risk, the need to implement preventive measures and a severe lack of necessary medical equipment and infrastructure.
According to Baburam Marasini, former director of Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Nepal lacked double-cab ambulances to transport highly infectious patients safely, isolation wards in hospitals, or biosafety level-3 or better laboratories needed to test for highly infectious diseases.

==
Timeline ==
The first COVID-19 case in Nepal was confirmed on 23 January in a 32-year-old man who had returned from China on 9 January.
The patient had shown mild symptoms, and was confirmed recovered when he tested negative on 29 and 31 January.
Though a few suspected patients were treated in the makeshift isolation ward of Teku Hospital, no new cases were reported until the last week of March.
Nepal focused its efforts on planning, prevention and preparation.

In the third week of March, Nepal began to see a significant influx of people from India as India saw increase in new cases throughout the country.
A noticeable outflux of people from the Kathmandu Valley was reported.
The second case was confirmed on 23 March in a young woman who had recently flown to Kathmandu from France via Qatar.
A nation-wide lockdown was implemented on 24 March.
By 4 April, six additional cases had been recorded in people who had recently returned from abroad.
The same day, the first case of local transmission was confirmed; a relative of one of the patients confirmed that day also tested positive.
The figures nearly doubled on a single day on 17 April, when 12 Indian nationals from Delhi, quarantined in a mosque in Bhulke of Udayapur, tested positive for the disease.
Increased testing in the Bhulke area discovered 16 new cases within a week.
Only four new patients were found in Bhulke in the following weeks; the first case outside Bhulke was confirmed on 14 May in a journalist from Gaighat Bazaar who had reported from Bhulke and attended other coronavirus-related events, bringing the total in Udayapur to 33.On
30 April, the total number of confirmed cases stood at 57; 16 of them had been discharged from hospitals after recovery.
Banke district recorded its first case on
1 May. Contact-tracing in the district discovered 22 new patients by 5
May. Parsa district, which had found seven cases of the disease in the preceding months, recorded 17 new cases on a single day on 5
May. Two youths who had been quarantined in Kapilvastu, having returned from Mumbai, tested positive for the disease on
6 May. By 11 May, Kapilvastu had a total of 15 cases; the district was sealed off for a week.
The neighbouring district of Rupandehi which had recorded its first case on 30 April, also emerged as a hotspot.
With Jhapa and Rautahat also recording more than 20 cases each, and isolated cases throughout the country, Nepal's coronavirus tally doubled almost every week in May
– it was at 59 on 1 May, but had reached 1042 on 28 May.
The first COVID-19 death in Nepal was that of a 29-year-old postnatal woman from Sindhupalchok on 14 May.


==
Response ==
Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital is the designated primary hospital for the treatment of COVID-19; isolation wards, makeshift hospitals and quarantine centres have been established throughout the country.
Nepal Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu was the only laboratory capable of testing for the disease as of 15 March; laboratory capabilities were later expanded to other major cities.
The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division devised its own treatment protocol in early February, based on the one developed by UN Health Agency, and directed all private hospitals to strictly follow the guidelines.
On 29 February, the government formed a high level committee to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokhrel.
On 20 March, the Health Ministry instructed public employees to report on weekends as well, and not leave the Kathmandu Valley.
The government declared a Rs 500 million fund with contributions of a month's salary from government ministers.
It also increased the allowances for health workers working at the front desks of hospitals by 50–100%.The Minister of Health declared that all patients of COVID-19 would be rescued as necessary and provided free treatment.
===
Hospitals ===
On 23 January, Dr. Bashudev Pandey, director of Teku Hospital, was quoted as saying that the hospital was on high alert, while three other hospitals – Nepal Police Hospital, Patan Hospital and Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital – would also treat the disease.
Six beds in Teku Hospital had been allocated for isolation of suspected patients.
By 4 February, national capacity for treating coronavirus was at 43 beds.
By 21 March, Gandaki Province had set up 111 isolation beds.
A meeting of the high-level coordination committee for prevention and control of COVID-19 on 17 March decided to add 115 ICU and 1,000 isolation beds in the Kathmandu Valley.
It also instructed the provincial governments to set up a total of 120 ICU beds.
On 20 March, the Health Ministry decided to halt non-urgent health check-ups and surgeries until 12 April in hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley with 50 or more beds.
On 21 March, the Health Ministry informed that private hospitals with more than 100 beds would not be allowed to refer patients to other hospitals; they were required to treat suspected patients, wait for test results and provide free treatment if the disease were confirmed.

===
Quarantines ===
The passengers and crew of the flight that evacuated the stranded from Hubei in mid-February were quarantined for two weeks at Kharipati in Bhaktapur.
On 21 March, around sixty passengers from COVID-19 affected countries that landed on Tribhuvan International Airport were sent to quarantine at Kharipati, Bhaktapur; they had not presented any symptoms.

===
Testing ===
The first case was confirmed by testing done in Hong Kong.
Nepali public laboratories did not have the reagents required for testing, which cost around Rs 17,000 per test and need to be bought in bulk.
As there were no other suspected cases needing testing, the officials elected to send the samples to Hong Kong.
The first tests inside Nepal were conducted at the bio-safety level-2 labs of the National Public Health Laboratory on 27 January.
Reagents sufficient for 100 tests were borrowed from the Centre for Molecular Dynamics, and test kits were provided by the World Health Organisation.
As of 23 March, the day Nepal confirmed the second case, 610 tests had been performed at the National Public Health Laboratory.
Testing capabilities were expanded to BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan on 29 March, and to Pokhara on 31 March.
By 6 April, the testing capabilities had been expanded to all seven provinces; a total of 10 laboratories were operational, four in Bagmati Pradesh and one each in the other six.
They were in Dharan, Janakpur, Kathmandu, Dhulikhel, Hetauda, Chitwan, Pokhara, Bhairahawa, Surkhet and Dhangadi.
On 10 April, Koshi Hospital, Biratnagar, became capable of testing for COVID-19.
Five thousand Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits were distributed to each of the provinces; around 500 RDTs were performed in three districts on the first day.
On 11 April, Bir Hospital and Teku Hospital began performing tests for COVID-19; RDT kits reached all 77 districts.
Most of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing done till then had been limited to quarantined recent arrivals to the country, and individuals identified via contact-tracing; the arrival of RDTs allowed more liberal use of the testing services.
By 14 April, more RDTs than PCR tests had been performed.

===
Health-desks and checkpoints ===
On 17 January, urged by the WHO, Nepal began screening passengers arriving in Tribhuvan International Airport from China, Thailand and Japan, the three countries with multiple confirmed cases.
Eight persons manned the health desk.
The airport did not have infrared scanners and was therefore using thermal scanners as preparations were being made to install the infrared ones.
The passengers who showed fever were being asked to remain in contact and visit the hospitals if they showed additional symptoms.
By 4 February, health desks had been setup in Pokhara, Chitwan and Bhairahawa.
By the first week of February, Districts bordering India began setting up health desks at border crossings.
By the end of February, the health desk at Tribhuvan International Airport was screening passengers from China, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but did not have sufficient manpower and equipment to screen all new arrivals.
A total of six infrared scanners had been setup; the only thermal scanner had yet to be repaired, but plans were underway to purchase three more.
Passengers were not being asked to fill locator forms that would make it possible to track them down later.
On 21 March, Kathmandu city launched a central help desk and a toll-free 24-hour hotline.

===
Travel restrictions and border closures ===
On 28 January, Nepal closed down the Rasuwagadhi border with China, bringing Nepal-China trade to a complete halt.
Nepal announced suspension of visa-on-arrival service for nationals of five countries badly affected by COVID-19 – China, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran – to be enforced from 7 to 30 March, although the implementation date was later reported to be 10 March.
From 2 March, the visitors coming from or via countries with multiple cases of the disease were required to submit a health certificate.
Health checkpoints began to be established at all major entry points from India, and third country citizens were allowed to cross from select border check-points only.
The government issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to countries hardest hit by the disease, including China, Iran, South Korea, Japan and Italy.
Nepal decided to suspend on-arrival tourist visa for all countries, with an exception to diplomatic and official visas, to last from 14 March till 30 April.
The government closed land border entry points for third country nationals, and cancelled all mountain climbing expeditions including on Mount Everest, to be enforced from 14 March to 30 April.
It also declared two-week mandatory self- and home-quarantines for everyone visiting Nepal.
By the third week of March, the land-border checkpoints with China began releasing imported goods following quarantine procedures as cases in China began to drop.
The government banned all passengers, including Nepalis, from EU and the UK, West Asia and the Middle East as well as Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, effective from 20 March until 15 April.

All international flights were stopped from 22 March and vehicular movement on long routes were closed from 23 March.
Nepal Tourism Board announced the suspension of issuance of trekking permits.
Nepal decided to close its land border with India and China for a week effective from 23 March.

===
Lockdown ===
On 19 March, the government declared suspension of all classes and postponement of all academic examinations including the Secondary Education Examination until 12 April, the end of the Month of Chaitra, the last month of Nepali calendar year when all schools hold the final examinations.
Tribhuvan University and the Public Service Commission also postponed all their examinations.
All government services and private offices except those providing essential services were closed.
The House of Representatives meeting was postponed.
The National Assembly was suspended indefinitely.
A full-bench meeting of the Supreme Court presided over by the Chief Justice decided to halt all non-urgent proceedings in courts across the country.
On 23 March, Kailali District declared an indefinite lock-down effective from 2 pm.
Arghakhanchi District also declared an indefinite lock-down.
The country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March.
There were only two confirmed cases from 610 RT-qPCR tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown
but these number increased to 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown.
The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located.

===
Public awareness ===
On 21 March, the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division deployed 200 of its personnel to display placards with awareness messages about the disease by the roadside.

===
Evacuations ===
Nepal evacuated 175 people, mostly students, who had been stranded across Hubei, on 16 February, using a Nepal Airlines chartered aeroplane and placed them in a 14-day quarantine at Kharipati in Bhaktapur.
Although 180 Nepalis had applied for immediate evacuation from China by 2 February, the effort took almost two weeks, as the government struggled to meet WHO's evacuation standards, and to find a suitable venue for quarantine.
The government was criticised for its slow response; a Public interest litigation was filed at the Supreme Court, while the locals around the designated quarantine site in Bhaktapur protested the government's decision which they viewed as endangering to the local community.
On 19 February, the Health Ministry reported that all of the evacuees had tested negative.
Rescue of tourists stranded throughout Nepal was initiated in the final week of March.
By 28 March, hundreds of tourists had been rescued and brought to Kathmandu; many were being repatriated via chartered flights.

International response ===
After the first case in South Asia was confirmed in Nepal on 23 January, bordering districts of India were reported to be in high alert, and medical personnel had been deployed to various entry points along the Indo-Nepal border.
By the end of February, India started screening passengers from Nepal and making masks compulsory for all visiting Nepalis.
It was also screening Nepalis travelling into India by land, at various checkpoints at the border.
India declared suspension of all passenger movement through Indo-Nepal border, except a few designated checkpoints—Banbasa, Raxaul, Ranigunj and Sunauli—with intensified health inspections, effective from 15 March.
In March, Germany pledged an additional one million Euros to its existing health programmes in Nepal to help combat the disease.
The US government pledged $1.8 million to Nepal.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed starting the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund for the SAARC region; he also said India could share a Disease Surveillance Software with SAARC partners, and hinted at the possibility of conducting coordinated research on controlling epidemic diseases in the SAARC region.

Controversies ==
Teku hospital discharged two suspected patients in the morning of 27 January without waiting for test results even though the results were due later that same day, raising concerns over its handling of the crisis.
The Health Ministry said it would start using police to guard suspected patients after a Saudi national admitted to Teku Hospital fled from isolation in mid-February.
Although 180 Nepalis had applied for immediate evacuation from China by 2 February, the effort took almost two weeks, as the government struggled to meet WHO's evacuation standards, and to find a suitable venue for quarantine.
The government was criticised for its slow response; a Public interest litigation was filed at the Supreme Court, while the locals around the designated quarantine site in Bhaktapur protested the government's decision which they viewed as endangering to the local community.
While giving a speech in Parliament on Tuesday, the prime minister of Nepal K.P
Oli quoted that "the COVID-19 coming from India is more lethal than those from China and Italy".
==
Impact ==
The tourism sector has been reported to be suffering due to the absence of Chinese tourists, as well as the various travel restrictions imposed on travel globally.
Manufacturing sector is experiencing a shortage of raw materials, most of which used to come from China.
The situation is exacerbated by spread of the pandemic to the Middle-east which is the main source of remittance that makes up more than half of Nepal's GDP.
Remittances were expected to sharply drop after Nepal suspended issuance of workers permit to Nepalis for all countries.
The wholesale and retail sector has also been affected due to fall of imports from China.
The construction sector which imports most of its building materials from China has slowed down.
As the Chinese contractors and workers who went home for the Chinese new year could not return, the public construction projects have also been affected.
The domestic airlines were reported to be struggling for survival as ticket prices dropped to half or a third of normal following a sharp decline in demand.
Number of international flights to and from Nepal had decreased by more than 50% by 13 March.
As emigration for foreign employment came to a halt, airlines were forced to suspended flights to several labour destinations.
Nepal's import-dependent economy is also vulnerable to depreciation of Indian currency to which its currency is permanently pegged, as Indian economy suffers the impact of the pandemic.
20,000 tour, trek and mountaineering guides lost their livelihood when mountaineering was suspended.
The annual Holi celebrations, which fell on 9 and 10 March in 2020 saw decreased activities, low business and cancellation of organised celebrations.
Nepal had declared 2020 as the Visit Nepal Year and aimed to bring in two million foreign tourists, almost double the figure from previous year.
As the pandemic spread and Nepal had to suspend air travel to and from China, the biggest source of international tourists arriving by air, Nepal suspended its promotional campaigns.
The temporary blanket ban on animal markets imposed by China as a response to the pandemic is expected to curb wildlife poaching and trafficking through Nepal, as the Chinese traditional medicine which uses various body parts of endangered animals as its ingredients has been the biggest challenge to wildlife conservation in the region.

===
Social life ===
In the beginning of March, the government urged the general public to avoid large gatherings.
On 18 March, the government shut down all cinema halls, gymnasiums, museums and cultural centres, and banned gatherings of more than 25 people in public spaces including at places of worship.

===
Law enforcement ===
In March, the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division suspended breathalyser tests as well as educational classes for drivers found breaking traffic rules.
Nepal Police established coronavirus response units in all its stations and decided not to make arrests for minor offences.
In March, the Office of the attorney General asked the Police to release people held for minor crimes under bail or parole to reduce crowding.

===
Foreign employment ===
In late February, Nepal suspended labour migration to South Korea.
On 8 March, Qatar imposed a temporary ban on arrivals from Nepal and other countries, affecting almost 40,000 labour migrants with valid work permits who were yet to leave.
In mid-March, labour permits for all countries were suspended indefinitely, including to workers who were back home on holiday.
The government also suspended issuance of no objection letters to students going for abroad study.

===
Shortages and black marketing ===
By the first week of February, Nepal reported a shortage of face masks, as people hurried to buy them.
Districts bordering India began setting up health desks at border crossings.
The government was forced to seek help from the UN, having failed to procure masks and protective gear due to global shortages.
In early March, due to a severe shortage of face-masks and protective gear as well as increase in price following a ban on export in China and India, some hospitals were reported to be sewing plain clothes masks as a precaution.
A shortage of hand sanitisers was also reported.
The department of Commerce, Supplies and Consumer Protection conducted raids on 161 firms and fined 57 of them, a total of around four million Rupees in the month of Falgun (February–March).
It inspected multiple pharmacies and surgical shops in Kathmandu on 5 March and fined a total of Rs 430,000 for hiking prices and other offences.
On 10 March, four pharmacies were fined a total of Rs 800,000 after they were caught charging 1000% of normal price for surgical masks.
Some groceries and LPG stores were also inspected.
One million units of face masks were confiscated from a warehouse in Kathmandu and the owner arrested on 18 March, bringing the total of masks confiscated in the week past to 2.3 million.
Around 50,000 units of hand-sanitisers were also confiscated from the black market.
Around two dozen black marketeers had been arrested.
As the outflux of people from Kathmandu intensified, 23 transport entrepreneurs and workers were arrested on 20 March for overcharging the passengers.

===
Essential drugs ===
Nepal's pharmaceutical industry has been impacted due to lack of raw materials as a number of essential ingredients were previously imported from Hubei.
Nepal faced the prospect of a potential shortage of essential medicines when India imposed restrictions on export of 26 types of raw materials including of essential medicine citing disruption in the supply chain from Hubei; however India later agreed to relax restrictions in case of Nepal, and asked the Nepalese government to provide a list of names and quantities of essential medicines that it needed to supply to Nepal.

===
Misinformation ===
On 21 March a 20-year-old man was arrested on charges of spreading misinformation online through an unregistered fake news website and causing public fear, after audio tapes alleging cover-up of COVID-19 cases were found circulating online.
The same day, Nepal Army dispelled rumours circulating in social media that claimed Army helicopters were being used to spray disinfectants over settlements at midnight.

===
Poaching ===
Poachers in Nepal took advantage of slack monitoring and sparse public movement during the COVID-19 lockdown and the country saw a surge in killings of wildlife under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.
In the first ten days of the countrywide lockdown, three critically endangered gharial were killed within the vicinity of Chitwan National Park, while an endangered Asiatic elephant was found electrocuted in the Bardiya National Park.
On 27 March 2020, gunfire was exchanged between about 10–11 poachers and the park rangers assisted by the military at the Parsa National Park.
A 37-year-old poacher died, a Nepali Army officer was injured and a 45-year-old man end up being arrested after the shooting.
In late April, six Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster), which are listed as endangered by IUCN, were found dead inside the Sagarmatha National Park.
About 54 wire traps were put up by the poachers near Namche Bazaar and one of them even snared a Golden eagle.
Nine people were arrested by Solukhumbu District Police in connection to the musk deer killings.
Sagarmartha National Park also encountered the illegal cuttings of Laligurans (Rhododendron arboreum), the national flower of Nepal.

===
Event cancellations ===
The Sagarmatha Sambad programme scheduled for April was also postponed.
Everest Premier League, the domestic T20 cricket tournament was postponed indefinitely.

Alphacoronaviruses (Alpha-CoV) are members of the first of the four genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-) of coronaviruses.
They are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect mammals, including humans.
They have spherical virions with club-shaped surface projections and a viral envelope.

Alphacoronaviruses are in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae.
Both the Alpha- and Betacoronavirus lineages descend from the bat viral gene pool.
Alphacoronaviruses were previously known as "phylogroup 1 coronaviruses".

==
Etymology ==
The name alphacoronavirus is derived from Ancient Greek ἄλφα (álpha, "the first letter of the Greek alphabet"), and κορώνη (korṓnē, “garland, wreath”), meaning crown, which describes the appearance of the surface projections seen under electron microscopy that resemble a solar corona.

==
Structure ==
The virion is enveloped and spherical measuring 120–160 nm in diameter and a core shell of about 65 nm.
Glycoproteins and trimers form large surface projections which create the appearance of solar corona.
This genus, like other coronaviruses, has a spike protein with a type II fusion machine (S2) and a receptor-binding domain (S1).
It assembles into a trimer.
Unlike
beta- and gammacoronaviruses, this protein is not cleaved into two halves.

== Genome ==
The genome is positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with a length of 27 to 29 kilobases and a 3’-polyA tail.
Two large, overlapping ORFs at the 5'-end of the genome encode the major non-structural proteins expressed as a fusion protein by ribosomal frameshift.
These include regions with protease, helicase and RNA polymerase motifs.
There are seven other genes downstream which encode structural proteins.
These are expressed from a 3'-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs.

==
Recombination ==
Both types of Alphacoronavirus 1, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV), are known to exist in two serotypes.
Serotype II targets Aminopeptidase N, while the receptor for Serotype I is unknown.
The difference is due to a different spike protein.
There is a common ancestor for FCoV and CCoV.
This ancestor gradually evolved into FCoV I and CCoV I.
An S protein from an unknown virus was recombined into the ancestor and gave rise to CCoV II.
CCoV II once again recombined with FCoV to create FCoV II.
CCoV II gradually evolved into TGEV.
A spike deletion in TGEV creates PRCV.
All these viruses are sorted into the subgenus Tegacovirus.

==

The following subgenera and species are recognized:
Colacovirus

Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.

Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.
They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.
The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.
They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.

==
Etymology ==
The name "coronavirus" is derived from Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "wreath", itself a borrowing from Greek κορώνη korṓnē, "garland, wreath".
The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses.
The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses.
The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo.
This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.
The scientific name Coronavirus was accepted as a genus name by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) in 1971.
As the number of new species increased, the genus was split into four genera, namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus in 2009.
The common name coronavirus is used to refer to any member of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae.
As of 2020, 45 species are officially recognised.

==
History ==
The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America.
Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota.
The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of 40–90%.
Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the infection in 1933.
The virus was then known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).
Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette cultivated the virus for the first time in 1937.
The specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain.
In the late 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, JHM that causes brain disease (murine encephalitis) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that causes hepatitis in mice were discovered.
It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related.
Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States.
E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated B814 in 1961.
The virus could not be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses.
In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea.
The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn.
The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope.
Dorothy Hamre and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students in 1962.
They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, designating it 229E.
The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether.

Scottish virologist June Almeida at St. Thomas Hospital in London, collaborating with Tyrrell, compared the structures of IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967.
Using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club-like spikes.
A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples OC43 (OC for organ culture).
Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.
The IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus.
This new group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance.
Human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus
OC43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades.
The coronavirus strain B814 was lost.
It is not known which present human coronavirus it was.
Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003,
HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.
There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.

==
Microbiology ==


=== Structure ===
Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections.
Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm.
Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter.
The total molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa.
They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules.
The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.
The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S)
structural proteins are anchored.
The molar ratio of E:S:
M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300.

The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size.
S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells.
But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein.
The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm.
The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron-dense shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the electron beam used to scan the virus
particle).The M protein is the main structural protein of the envelope that provides the overall shape and is a type III membrane protein.
It consists of 218 to 263 amino acid residues and forms a layer 7.8 nm thick.
It has three domains, a short N-terminal ectodomain, a triple-spanning transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal endodomain.
The C-terminal domain forms a matrix-like lattice that adds to the extra-thickness of the envelope.
Different species can have either N- or O-linked glycans in their protein amino-terminal domain.
The M protein is crucial during the assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis stages of the virus lifecycle.
The E proteins are minor structural proteins and highly variable in different species.
There are only about 20 copies of the E protein molecule in a coronavirus particle.
They are 8.4 to 12 kDa in size and are composed of 76 to 109 amino acids.
They are integral proteins (i.e. embedded in the lipid layer) and have two domains namely a transmembrane domain and an extramembrane C-terminal domain.
They are almost fully α-helical, with a single α-helical transmembrane domain, and form pentameric (five-molecular) ion channels in the lipid bilayer.
They are responsible for virion assembly, intracellular trafficking and morphogenesis (budding).

The spikes are the most distinguishing feature of coronaviruses and are responsible for the corona- or halo-like surface.
On average a coronavirus particle has 74 surface spikes.
Each spike is about 20 nm long and is composed of a trimer of the S protein.
The S protein is in turn composed of an S1 and S2 subunit.
The homotrimeric S protein is a class I fusion protein which mediates the receptor binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell.
The S1 subunit forms the head of the spike and has the receptor-binding domain (RBD).
The S2 subunit forms the stem which anchors the spike in the viral envelope and on protease activation enables fusion.
The two subunits remain noncovalently linked as they are exposed on the viral surface until they attach to the host cell membrane.
In a functionally active state, three S1 are attached to two S2 subunits.
The subunit complex is split into individual subunits when the virus binds and fuses with the host cell under the action of proteases such as cathepsin family and transmembrane protease
serine 2
(TMPRSS2) of the host cell.

S1 proteins are the most critical components in terms of infection.
They are also the most variable components as they are responsible for host cell specificity.
They possess two major domains named N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), both of which serve as the receptor-binding domains.
The NTDs recognize and bind sugars on the surface of the host cell.
An exception is the MHV NTD that binds to a protein receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1).
S1-CTDs are responsible for recognizing different protein receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DPP4).A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also has a shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).
The HE proteins occur as homodimers composed of about 400 amino acid residues and are 40 to 50 kDa in size.
They appear as tiny surface projections of 5 to 7 nm long embedded in between the spikes.
They help in the attachment to and detachment from the host cell.
Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type conformation.
N protein is a phosphoprotein of 43 to 50 kDa in size, and is divided into three conserved domains.
The majority of the protein is made up of domains 1 and 2, which are typically rich in arginines and lysines.
Domain 3 has a short carboxy terminal end and has a net negative charge due to excess of acidic over basic amino acid residues.

===
Genome ===
Coronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome.
The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases.
The genome size is one of the largest among RNA viruses.
The genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail.
The genome organization for a coronavirus is 5′-leader-UTR-replicase (ORF1ab)-spike (S)-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-3′UTR-poly (A) tail.
The open reading frames 1a and 1b, which occupy the first two-thirds of the genome, encode the replicase polyprotein (pp1ab).
The replicase polyprotein self cleaves to form 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1–nsp16).The later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid.
Interspersed between these reading frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins.
The number of accessory proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus.

===
Replication cycle ===


====
Cell entry ====
Infection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor.
After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein.
Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane.

====
Genome translation ====
On entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm.
The coronavirus RNA genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail, which allows it to act like a messenger RNA and be directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes.
The host ribosomes translate the initial overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b of the virus genome into two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab.
The larger polyprotein pp1ab is a result of a -1 ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot at the end of open reading frame ORF1a.
The ribosomal frameshift allows for the continuous translation of ORF1a followed by ORF1b.
The polyproteins have their own proteases,  PLpro (nsp3) and 3CLpro (nsp5), which cleave the polyproteins at different specific sites.
The cleavage of polyprotein pp1ab yields 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16).
Product proteins include various replication  proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), RNA helicase (nsp13), and exoribonuclease (nsp14).

====
Replicase-transcriptase ====
A number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex.
The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand.
The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process.
The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks.
Replication – One of the main functions of the complex is to replicate the viral genome.
RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense genomic RNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA.
This is followed by the replication of positive-sense genomic RNA from the negative-sense genomic RNA.

Transcription – The other important function of the complex is to transcribe the viral genome.
RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positive-sense genomic RNA.
This process is followed by the transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mRNAs.
The subgenomic mRNAs form a "nested set" which have a common 5'-head and partially duplicate 3'-end.
Recombination –
The replicase-transcriptase complex is also capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same infected cell.

RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within a coronavirus species, the capability of a coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and, infrequently, in determining the emergence of novel coronaviruses.

The exact mechanism of recombination in coronaviruses is unclear, but likely involves template switching during genome replication.

==== Assembly and release ===
=
The replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses.
The mRNAs are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame.
These mRNAs are translated by the host's ribosomes into the structural proteins and a number of accessory proteins.
RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum.
The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment.
There, the M proteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid.
Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles.
Once released the viruses can infect other host cells.

===
Transmission ===
Infected carriers are able to shed viruses into the environment.
The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complementary cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the released virus.
Coronaviruses mainly target epithelial cells.
They are transmitted from one host to another host, depending on the coronavirus species, by either an aerosol, fomite, or fecal-oral route.
Human coronaviruses infect the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, while animal coronaviruses generally infect the epithelial cells of the digestive tract.
SARS coronavirus, for example, infects the human epithelial cells of the lungs via an aerosol route by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) infects the pig epithelial cells of the digestive tract via a fecal-oral route by binding to the alanine aminopeptidase (APN) receptor.

Coronaviruses form the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, which is one of two sub-families in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.
They are divided into the four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus.

Origin ==
The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species.
The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and of the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE.
Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus – and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses).
The large number and global range of bat and avian species that host viruses has enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.
Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats.
The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 CE.
The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 CE.
More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960.
MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels.
MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago.
The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986.
The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats of the genus Hipposideridae; subsequently, they spread to horseshoe bats in the species
Rhinolophidae, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans.
Unlike other betacoronaviruses, bovine coronavirus of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and subgenus Embecovirus is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats.
In the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump.
Later in the 1890s, human coronavirus OC43 diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event.
It is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, and unknown causative agent of the pandemic.
Besides causing respiratory infections, human coronavirus OC43 is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases.
In the 1950s, the human coronavirus OC43 began to diverge into its present genotypes.
Phylogentically, mouse hepatitis virus (Murine coronavirus), which infects the mouse's liver and central nervous system, is related to human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus.
Human coronavirus HKU1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.

==
Infection in humans ==
Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor.
Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold.
Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids.
Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).
The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
Six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.

Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild, even though it is contended they might have been more aggressive in the past:
Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), β-CoV
Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), β-CoV
Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E),
α-CoV
Human coronavirus
NL63 (
HCoV-NL63)
, α-CoVThree human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are potentially severe:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2003)
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2012)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), β-CoV (identified in 2019)These cause the diseases commonly called SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 respectively.

===
Common cold ===
Although the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about 15% of cases the cause is a coronavirus.
The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold.
The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates.

There is no preponderance in any season in tropical climates.

===
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ===
In 2003, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which had begun the prior year in Asia, and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by a number of laboratories was the causative agent for SARS.
The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
More than 8,000 people from 29 different countries and territories were infected, and at least 774 died.

===
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) ===
In September 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called Novel Coronavirus 2012, and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
The World Health Organization issued a global alert soon after.
The WHO update on 28 September 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person.
However, on 12 May 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in France was confirmed by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
In addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the Ministry of Health in Tunisia.
Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
Despite this, it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus.
By 30 October 2013, there were 124 cases and 52 deaths in Saudi Arabia.
After the Dutch Erasmus Medical Centre sequenced the virus, the virus was given a new name, Human Coronavirus—Erasmus Medical Centre (HCoV-EMC).
The final name for the virus is Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
The only U.S. cases (both survived) were recorded in May 2014.In May 2015, an outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in the Republic of Korea, when a man who had traveled to the Middle East, visited four hospitals in the Seoul area to treat his illness.
This caused one of the largest outbreaks of MERS-CoV outside the Middle East.
As of December 2019, 2,468 cases of MERS-CoV infection had been confirmed by laboratory tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately 34.5%.
===
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ===
In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China.
On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

As of 29 April 2021, there have been at least 3,153,526 confirmed deaths and more than 149,744,454 confirmed cases in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group 2B with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV.
The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.

==
Infection in animals ==
Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s.

They infect a range of animals including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds and bats.

The majority of animal related coronaviruses infect the intestinal tract and are transmitted by a fecal-oral route.
Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases.

===
Farm animals ===
Coronaviruses infect domesticated birds.
Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a type of coronavirus, causes avian infectious bronchitis.
The virus is of concern to the poultry industry because of the high mortality from infection, its rapid spread, and its effect on production.
The virus affects both meat production and egg production and causes substantial economic loss.
In chickens, infectious bronchitis virus targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract.
The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken.
The virus is transmitted by aerosol and food contaminated by feces.
Different vaccines against IBV exist and have helped to limit the spread of the virus and its variants.
Infectious bronchitis virus is one of a number of strains of the species Avian coronavirus.
Another strain of avian coronavirus is turkey coronavirus (TCV) which causes enteritis in turkeys.
Coronaviruses also affect other branches of animal husbandry such as pig farming and the cattle raising.
Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which is related to bat coronavirus HKU2, causes diarrhea in pigs.
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that has recently emerged and similarly causes diarrhea in pigs.
Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is a member of the species Alphacoronavirus 1, is another coronavirus that causes diarrhea in young pigs.
In the cattle industry bovine coronavirus (BCV), which is a member of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and related to HCoV-OC43, is responsible for severe profuse enteritis in young calves.

===
Domestic pets ===
Coronaviruses infect domestic pets such as cats, dogs, and ferrets.
There are two forms of feline coronavirus which are both members of the species Alphacoronavirus 1.
Feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease with high mortality.
There are two different coronaviruses that infect dogs.
Canine coronavirus (CCoV), which is a member of the species Alphacoronavirus 1, causes mild gastrointestinal disease.
Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), which is a member of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and related to HCoV-OC43, cause respiratory disease.
Similarly, there are two types of coronavirus that infect ferrets.
Ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE), and a more lethal systemic version of the virus (like FIP in cats) known as ferret systemic coronavirus (FSC).

===
Laboratory animals ===
Coronaviruses infect laboratory animals.
Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which is a member of the species Murine coronavirus, causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice.

Prior to the discovery of SARS-CoV, MHV was the best-studied coronavirus both in vivo and in vitro as well as at the molecular level.

Some strains of MHV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis.
Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), which is a strain of the species Murine coronavirus, is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol.

Rabbit enteric coronavirus causes acute gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in young European rabbits.

Mortality rates are high.

== Prevention and treatment ==
A number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins.
Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication.
Vaccines are available for animal coronaviruses IBV, TGEV, and Canine CoV, although their effectiveness is limited.
In the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, such as PEDV, measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other herds.

This article presents official statistics gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

The CDC publishes official numbers, originally every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and reports several categories of cases: individual travelers, people who contracted the disease from other people within the U.S., and repatriated citizens who returned to the U.S. from crisis locations, such as Wuhan, where the disease originated, and the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
However, multiple sources noted that statistics on confirmed coronavirus cases were misleading, since the shortage of tests meant the actual number of cases was much higher than the number of cases confirmed.
The number of deaths confirmed to be due to coronavirus was likely to be an undercount for the same reason.
Excess mortality comparing deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average is more reliable.
It counts additional deaths which are not explained by official reported coronavirus mortality statistics.
The CDC says it will issue an official estimate of coronavirus deaths in 2021—current estimates may not be reliable.
The following numbers are based on CDC data, which is incomplete.
In most U.S. locations, testing for some time was performed only on symptomatic people with a history of travel to Wuhan or with close contact to such people.
CDC testing protocols did not include non-travelling patients with no known contact with China until February 28.

==
Measuring case and mortality rates ==
By March 26, the United States, with the world's third-largest population, surpassed China and Italy as the country with the world's highest number of confirmed cases.
By April 25, the U.S. had more than 905,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 52,000 deaths, giving it a mortality rate around 5.7 percent.
(
In comparison, Spain's mortality rate was 10.2 percent and Italy's was 13.5 percent.)In April, more than 10,000 American deaths had occurred in nursing homes.
Most nursing homes did not have easy access to testing, making the actual number unknown.
Subsequently, a number of states including Maryland and New Jersey reported their own estimates of deaths at nursing homes, ranging from twenty to fifty percent of the states' total deaths.
A PNAS report in September confirmed that the virus is much more dangerous for the elderly than the young, noting that about 70% of all U.S. COVID-19 deaths had occurred to those over the age of 70.
In April, President Trump had established a Coronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes.
As of early August 2020, among the 45 countries that had over 50,000 cases, the U.S. had the eighth highest number of deaths per-capita.
Its case fatality ratio, however, was significantly better where it ranked 24th in the world, with 3.3% of its cases resulting in death.
Several studies suggest both that the number of infections is far higher than officially reported, and thus that the infection fatality rate is far lower than the case fatality rate.
The CDC estimates that 40 percent of people infected will never show symptoms (asymptomatic), although there is a 75% chance they can still spread the disease.
And while children have a lower risk of becoming ill or dying, the CDC warns that they can still function as asymptomatic carriers and transmit the virus to adults.
The American Academy of Pediatrics's weekly report from when states started reporting to September 17 tracked 587,948 child COVID-19 cases, 5,016 child hospitalizations, and 109 child deaths.
In counting actual confirmed cases, some have questioned the reliability of totals reported.
Within the U.S., there are discrepancies in rates between different states and racial and economic disparities.
After a group of epidemiologists requested revisions in how the CDC counts cases and deaths, the CDC in mid-April updated its guidance for counting COVID-19 cases and deaths to include both confirmed and probable ones, although each state can still determine what to report.
Without accurate reporting of cases and deaths, however, epidemiologists have difficulty in guiding government response.
On September 25, 2020, The Lancet published the largest study at the time to measure COVID-19 antibody levels in the US population, finding that less than ten percent of the U.S. population had been exposed.
The study was published at a time when according to Newsweek, "Some U.S. officials have floated the concept of herd immunity as a possible strategy to manage the national outbreak," and according to the lead author of the study, Director of the Stanford Center for Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease Shuchi Anand, "this study does not support that there is herd immunity."
The research also uncovered racial and economic disparities in populations with COVID-19 antibodies and highlighted the need for public health intervention to address the disparities.
At the time of the publication of the study, Anand announced that researchers would continue to monitor the study participants for months to help determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation tactics.

Death projections ==
On March 31, 2020, the CDC projected that eventually 100,000–240,000 Americans would die of coronavirus.
The lower end of the estimate was reached within two months after the CDC made its projection, and the upper end was surpassed in November
2020.The CDC uses an ensemble forecast, meaning it receives predictions from multiple sources and aggregates them to make its own forecast.
As of December 2020, the CDC included 37 modeling groups in its ensemble forecast and was predicting the death toll 4 weeks in advance.
Examples:
At the end of May 2020, the CDC correctly projected the death toll would surpass 115,000 by June 20.

At the end of July 2020, the CDC correctly projected the death toll would surpass 168,000 by August 22.

In mid-October 2020, the CDC correctly projected the death toll would reach 230,000–250,000 by mid-November.
In mid-February 2021, when the death toll had already reached 470,000, the IHME projected that the death toll would reach 600,000 by June 1.

The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020.
India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia.
As of April 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with more than 17 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and 195,123 deaths as of 26 April 2021.The first cases of covid-19 in India were reported in the towns of Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasargod, all in the state of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan.
Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March.
By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane.
On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.
In July 2020, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said that the country's case fatality rate was among the lowest in the world at 2.41%  and was "steadily declining".
Infection rates started to drop significantly in September, and the number of daily new cases and active cases started to decline rapidly.
Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, and came down to below 15,000 in January 2021 before rising again under a second wave from March 2021.
On 19 January 2021, nearly a year after the first reported case in India, Lakshadweep became the last region to report its first case.
The second wave of cases was much larger than the first, and there were shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines in various parts of the country.
India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021, in what was described by The Hindu as the largest in the world.
India has authorised the British Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield), the Indian BBV152 (Covaxin) vaccine, and the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use.

Timeline ==


===
2020 ===
On 12 January 2020, the WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.On 30 January 2020, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Thrissur, Kerala, which rose to three cases by 3 February 2020; all were students returning from Wuhan.
Apart from these, no significant rise in transmissions was observed in February.
On 4 March, 22 new cases were reported, including 14 infected members of an Italian tourist group.
In March, the transmissions grew after several people with travel history to affected countries, and their contacts, tested positive.
On 12 March, a 76-year-old man, with a travel history to Saudi Arabia, became the first COVID-19 fatality of India.
A Sikh preacher, who had a travel history to Italy and Germany, turned into a superspreader by attending a Sikh festival in Anandpur Sahib during 10–12 March.
27
COVID-19 cases were traced back to him.
Over 40,000 people in 20 villages in Punjab were quarantined on 27 March to contain the spread.
On 31 March, a Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation event in Delhi, which had taken place earlier in March, emerged as a superspreader event, after numerous cases across the country were traced back to it.
On 18 April, the Health ministry announced that 4,291 cases were directly linked to the event.

As of 4 April, about 22,000 people who came in contact with the Tablighi Jamaat missionaries had to be quarantined.
On 2 May, in Punjab, around 4,000 stranded pilgrims returned from Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Many of them tested positive, including 27 bus drivers and conductors who had been part of the transport arrangement.
As of 13 May, 1,225 pilgrims had tested positive.
In July 2020, it was reported based on antibody tests that at least 57% of the inhabitants of Mumbai's slums may have been infected with COVID-19 at some point.
A government panel on COVID-19 found in October 2020 that the pandemic had peaked in India, and could come under control by February 2021.
This prediction was based on a mathematical simulation referred to as the "Indian Supermodel", assuming that India reaches herd immunity.
That month, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant, Lineage B.1.617, was detected in the country.

=== 2021 ===
A vaccination programme began 16 January, 2021.
By February 2021, daily cases had fallen to 9,000 per-day.
In a paper on an improved simulation model published February 2021, the authors of the Supermodel estimated the immunity of the Indian population to be close to 60%, and claimed that India might be the only major economy that had successfully implemented a herd immunity strategy.
Despite concerns surrounding the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 in the country, nightclubs, restaurants, markets, and the Hindu spring festival of Holi on 29 March were being met with large crowds, with many of them flouting health and safety guidance such as social distancing.
Despite announcing that India was the quickest country in the world to administer at least 100 million vaccine doses, the vaccination programme began to be hit with supply issues.
India suspended exports of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine in order to meet demand.
Hesitancy and a lack of knowledge among poorer, rural communities has also impacted the programme.
On 9 April, India surpassed 1 million active cases.
On 12 April, India overtook Brazil as having the second-highest overall number of COVID-19 cases worldwide.
The surge is thought to have been caused by the B.1.617 variant that had been first discovered last October, which contains multiple mutations.
The Haridwar Kumbh Mela was described as having become a superspreader, being linked to at least 1,700 positive cases between 10-14 April alone, and 68 cases among Hindu seers between 5-14 April.
Normally four months in length, the festival was shortened to a single month due to the pandemic.
On 16 April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked residents to "keep Kumbh Mela symbolic" in order "give strength to India's fight against the virus", and Swami Avdheshanand urged devotees to avoid large gatherings and follow health guidance while participating in the Mela.
By late April, India passed 2.5 million active cases and was reporting 300,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths every day.
Some analysts feared this was an undercount; epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee has estimated that the actual death toll of the pandemic in India may be two to five times higher than the official totals.
On 26 April, India reported 350,000 new cases and over 2,800 deaths in one day.
The surge is thought to be caused by a new variant.
The second wave has placed a major strain on the healthcare system,  including an ongoing shortage of liquid medical oxygen due to unanticipated demand, delays in transport, and a lack of cryogenic tankers.
On 21 April, 22
COVID-19 patients who required ventilators died at a hospital in Maharashtra after an accident caused a leak in its main oxygen supply.
On 23 April, Prime Minister Modi met via videoconference with liquid oxygen suppliers, where he acknowledged the need to "provide solutions in a very short time", and acknowledged efforts such as increases in production, and the use of rail (with the Indian Railways transporting tankers via "Oxygen Express" trains) and air transport to deliver oxygen supplies.
On 25 April, the PM CARES Fund announced that it would allocate funding to install 551 oxygen plants using pressure swing adsorption at public health facilities.
Other countries announced that they would provide emergency aid to India, including European Union member states—which are sending oxygen supplies, medicines and ventilators through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the United Kingdom—which is sending oxygen concentrators and additional ventilators, and the United States—which is sending personal protective equipment, and lifted a control on the export of vaccines and vaccine materials in order to send raw materials for producing the Oxford
–AstraZeneca vaccine (with President Joe Biden considering it to be in return for having received assistance from India earlier).
Head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
Anthony Fauci stated that the country had not ruled out sending supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine—which has not yet been approved in the U.S.—to India.

==
Health care and testing ==
The Union Health Ministry's war room and policy making team in New Delhi consists of the ministry's Emergency Medical Response Unit, the Central Surveillance Unit (IDSP), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and experts from three government hospitals.
They are part of policy decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the country.
A cluster-containment strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how India contained previous epidemics, as well as "breaking the chain of transmission".
15 labs across India led by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, are testing for the virus, with more labs being trained, as of early March.
On 13 March, 52 labs were named capable of virus testing.
On 14 March, scientists at the National Institute of Virology isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus.
By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus after China, Japan, Thailand and the US.
The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that isolation of the virus will help towards expediting the development of drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country.
NIV has shared two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with GISAID.
On 16 April, China sent 650,000 testing kits to India but their use was discontinued in view of a very low accuracy (of just 5.4%).
In May, National Institute of Virology introduced another antibody test kit ELISA for rapid testing, capable of processing 90 samples in a single run of 2.5 hours.

====
Initial testing ====
Initially, the labs tested samples only from those with a travel history to 12 countries designated as high-risk, or those who had come in contact with anyone testing positive for the coronavirus, or showing symptoms as per the government guidelines.
On 20 March, the government decided to also include all pneumonia cases, regardless of travel or contact history after the country saw a sharp increase in the number of cases.
The first and second confirmatory tests for the virus has been made free by the government.
On 9 April, ICMR further revised the testing strategy and allowed testing of the people showing symptoms for a week in the hotspot areas of the country, regardless of travel history or local contact to a patient.
The Ministry of Health said that only 10 per cent of test capacity had been used per day till 15 March, claiming that the number of tests was enough.
However experts thought they were not, saying that community transmission may go undetected without adequate testing.
They also wanted to add more testing centres by including private laboratories.
In mid-March the government authorised accredited private labs to test for the virus.

==== Expansion of tests ====
On 17 March, the Union Ministry of Health had decided to allow private pathology labs to test for COVID-19.
The ministry official claimed that by allowing private labs, the work of testing can be doubled.
The ministry said that National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited laboratories may soon be allowed.
Once set up, a person can get COVID-19 test done at a private lab after a qualified physician in a government facility recommends it.
The ICMR has appealed to the private labs to offer the tests for free as the government labs do.
On 18 March, a top health ministry official said that a Swiss private company named Roche Diagnostics has been given the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency approval to conduct tests for coronavirus.
The Indian regulator has given them a licence to conduct diagnostic tests of the virus on 17 March.
The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) was assessing giving another firm licence while two Indian diagnostic companies have also sought approval for the coronavirus testing kits developed by them.
The government has also issued guidelines to cap the cost of sample testing by private labs at ₹4,500.On 19 March, Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy stated that India could be facing a "tsunami of cases within a few weeks" as testing increases and the reason for the low number of confirmed cases currently is due to under-testing.
He also said that according to mathematical models applied in the US or UK at least 20%–60% of the population will be affected.
Applying the same models in India means that at the lower end of the estimate there could be 300 million cases of which 4–8 million could be severe.111 additional labs for testing became functional on 21 March.
On 24 March, Pune-based molecular diagnostic company Mylab Discovery Solutions became the first Indian company to have received validation for its RT-PCR tests from National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).
The test takes 2.5 hours and the company is looking to price it at around ₹1,200 (US$17), or Rs 80,000 for a 100 test kit.
In April, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology of Delhi had developed low cost paper-strip test that could detect COVID-19 within an hour.
Each test would cost ₹500 (US$7.00) and method could fulfill India's rapid need of testing.
On 13 April, ICMR advised pool testing in the low infection areas with a positivity rate less than 2% to increase the capacity of the testing and save resources.
In this process maximum five samples are tested at once and samples are tested individually only if a pool tests positive.
Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Uttar Pradesh have started doing pool testing.

On 14 April, ICMR and DGCI approved 18 new suppliers of test kits that included three Indian firms, bringing the total suppliers to 51.On 16 April, 650,000 rapid antibody test and RNA extraction kits were dispatched from China, and over 2 million kits were to be sent in next 15 days.
On 21 April, Health department of West Bengal alleged that large number of testing kits supplied by ICMR-NICED (National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases) were giving inconclusive results.
ICMR-NICED admitted that there was problem in the kits and said that they are addressing the issue.
While Rajasthan stopped using rapid testing kits as they were giving low accuracy of 5.4% in compared to expected 90% accuracy.
Later, ICMR advised all states to stop using rapid testing kits for next two days until their on-ground teams validates these kits.
Rapid antibody test kits were put on hold till further notice.
The Chinese manufactures of the rapid testing kits said that the testing kits were approved by ICMR and the problem is not with the kits but with the way they were being used.
However, Chinese manufacturers promised to cooperate with Indian authorities to resolve the issue.
Amid this, ICMR asked states to return the faulty kits which will be sent back to the Chinese suppliers and cancelled the order of all remaining kits.

Testing community transmission ====
Testing for community transmission began on 15 March.
65 laboratories of the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) have started testing random samples of people who exhibit flu-like symptoms and samples from patients without any travel history or contact with infected persons.
As of 18 March, no evidence of community transmission was found after results of 500 random samples tested negative.
Between 15 February and 2 April, 5,911 SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses) patients were tested throughout the country of which, 104 tested positive (1.8%) in 20 states and union territories.
About 40% of the identified patients did not have travel history or any history of contact with a positive patient.
The ICMR advised to prioritize containment in the 36 districts of 15 states which had reported positive cases among SARI patients.
Till the third quarter of the year, India had attained the highest number of daily tests in the world.

Research and treatment ===
In Rajasthan, a combination of anti-malaria, anti-swine flu and anti-HIV drugs resulted in the recovery of three patients in March 2020.
In the same month, the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Cipla launched a joint venture to develop anti-COVID-19 drugs.
Another Indian firm, Stempeutics, announced plans to introduce a stem cell-based agent for treating critical COVID-19 patients.
In March, a startup incubated in Pune's Sci-Tech Park introduced 'Airon', a negative ion generator capable of reducing a room's viral load by 99.7%.
In April, funds for a number of preventive agents were released to initiate research.
On 23 March, the National Task Force for COVID-19 constituted by the ICMR recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of high-risk cases.
According to estimates, India has around 40,000 ventilators, of which 8,432 are with the public sector.
Various Indian PSUs, firms and startups, including DRDO and ISRO, have since repurposed their production lines to manufacture general PPEs, full body suits and ventilators.
They are also designing low-cost or mobile medical equipment.
The focus was to increase the production of low-cost, compact and portable ventilators that could cater to multiple patients at a time.
This led to the creation of some of the world's smallest and cheapest ventilators.
The government aims to double the current capacity of ventilators by June 2020 with the assistance from PSUs.
The government has also requested major private automakers to explore the possibility of manufacturing ventilators at their plants.
Maruti Suzuki, in collaboration with AgVa Healthcare, will supply 10,000 ventilators till end of the May.
From nil in near past, India was producing around 200,000 PPE kits and 250,000 N95 masks per day in May 2020.
By second half of month, India had emerged as world's second largest producer of PPE body coveralls.
The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has been working on genome sequencing of COVID-19.
In May, CCMB also started a partnership with a private company Eyestem Research to grow novel coronavirus strain in human lung epithelial cells for research and trials of anti-viral drugs.
On 12 April, the ICMR invited health institutions and hospitals to participate in trials of convalescent plasma therapy and plasma exchange therapy.
Later, the ICMR submitted a list of such institutes to the DCGI to start trials, which the DCGI approved.
Several states were allowed by ICMR to start clinical trials of the plasma therapy.
In Delhi, a 49-year-old man who was on ventilator support became the first patient in the country, who recovered through plasma therapy in April.
Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that the initial results of the plasma therapy treatment on four patients gave positive and encouraging results, adding that they had decided to conduct it on three more patients.
However, the ICMR later stated that there is no robust evidence to support convalescent plasma therapy as a routine therapy, describing it is as an emerging and experimental therapy.
It has some risks, which include life-threatening allergies and lung injuries.
The ICMR have since started multi-centre clinical trials to ensure the treatment's safety and efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients across the country.
In June 2020, India approved the repurposing of a generic version of the antiviral medication favipiravir, manufactured by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals under the branding "FabiFlu" for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
India later approved generic versions by Cipla and the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Jenburkt, and Lupin Limited at lower costs than FabiFlu.
On 23 April 2021, Cadila Healthcare received an emergency authorisation to repurpose Peginterferon alfa-2b, a medication used to treat hepatitis C, as a treatment for moderate COVID-19 in adults.
In July 2020, the Indian firm Biocon received emergency authorisation for the use of the repurposed drug Itolizumab in treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, one of the symptoms of the disease.

Vaccination ===
In September 2020, federal science minister Harsh Vardhan stated that the country planned to have a COVID-19 vaccine approved within the first quarter of 2021.
30 million health workers directly dealing with COVID patients, especially doctors and other medical personnel, were to be prioritised as part of Phase 1.On 1 January 2021, the Drug Controller General of India granted an emergency use authorisation to the British Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being produced locally by the Serum Institute of India under the trade name "Covishield" for domestic use and export.
On 2 January, the country also approved BBV152 (Covaxin), a domestic vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology.
This approval was met with some concern, as the vaccine had not then completed phase 3 trials.
India officially launched its vaccination program on 16 January, Over 160,000 doses were administered on the first day.
Due to the second wave, in late-March 2021 the country placed a hold on all exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine in order to meet local demand.
In April 2021, India approved the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.

As of 28 April 2021, 1.08 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies collated by Our World in Data.

During a pandemic on the rapid timeline and scale of COVID‑19 infections during 2020, international organizations like the WHO and CEPI, vaccine developers, governments, and industry are evaluating the distribution of the eventual vaccine(s).
Individual countries producing a vaccine may be persuaded to favor the highest bidder for manufacturing or provide first-service to their own country.
Experts emphasize that licensed vaccines should be available and affordable for people at the frontline of healthcare and having the greatest need.
In April 2020, it was reported that the UK agreed to work with 20 other countries and global organizations including France, Germany and Italy to find a vaccine and to share the results and that UK citizens would not get preferential access to any new COVID‑19 vaccines developed by taxpayer-funded UK universities.
Several companies plan to initially manufacture a vaccine at artificially low pricing, then increase prices for profitability later if annual vaccinations are needed and as countries build stock for future needs.
An April 2020 CEPI report stated: "Strong international coordination and cooperation between vaccine developers, regulators, policymakers, funders, public health bodies, and governments will be needed to ensure that promising late-stage vaccine candidates can be manufactured in sufficient quantities and equitably supplied to all affected areas, particularly low-resource regions.
"
The WHO and CEPI are developing financial resources and guidelines for global deployment of several safe, effective COVID‑19 vaccines, recognizing the need is different across countries and population segments.

For example, successful COVID‑19 vaccines would likely be allocated first to healthcare personnel and populations at greatest risk of severe illness and death from COVID‑19 infection, such as the elderly or densely-populated impoverished people.
The WHO, CEPI, and GAVI have expressed concerns that affluent countries should not receive priority access to the global supply of eventual COVID‑19 vaccines, but rather protecting healthcare personnel and people at high risk of infection are needed to address public health concerns and reduce economic impact of the pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom referred to subsequent inequities in the distribution as "a catastrophic moral failure".
A March 2021 survey of 77 epidemiologists concluded that mutations would render existing vaccines ineffective within one year — a window which wealthy nations were on pace to meet.
Conversely, an Economist Intelligence Unit report from earlier in the year estimated that a similar level of herd immunity would not be achieved globally until 2024.

==
Distribution ==


===
Phased distribution ===
Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications such as the elderly and those at high risk of exposure and transmission such as healthcare workers.
In the United States, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted on 1 December 2020 that the first doses of the vaccine should be prioritized for healthcare workers and residents and staff of nursing homes.
ACIP recommended that the second phase of distribution (Phase 1b) include persons aged ≥75 years and non-healthcare frontline essential workers such as those employed in grocery stores, restaurants, military, law enforcement, fire departments, retail, sanitation, schools, public transportation, self-storage, hotels, warehousing, and news media.
However, states control the final plans for prioritization, distribution, and logistics of vaccinating everyone as supply becomes available.
The European Union began phased vaccine rollout on 27 December 2020.
Each member state is managing distribution with a common focus on prioritizing healthcare workers, people at high risk of exposure, the elderly, and those with serious health conditions.
The COVID‑19 vaccination programme in the United Kingdom prioritized elder care facility residents and carers, followed by healthcare workers and those over 80 years of age.
Subsequent phases are based largely on age, declining from 75 years in 5-year increments.
Some countries used accelerated dose 1 plans with extended dose 2 intervals after the first dose in order to extend vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability improved.
Data suggests that people who have recovered from COVID-19 may only require a single dose of an mRNA vaccine to reach full two dose immunity.

===
Mixed series ===
The use of the different vaccines in a two shot regimen is not recommended or deliberately employed by any vaccinating nation; there is no data on the efficacy of mixed series for COVID-19 vaccines but such series are not expected to be unsafe or ineffective.
The US's CDC recommends the use of a mixed series only in exceptional circumstances, such as where a second dose of the same vaccine cannot be delivered in a reasonable timeframe.

===
Equitable access ===
During 2020, as the COVID‑19 pandemic escalated globally and vaccine development intensified, the WHO COVAX Facility adopted the motto "
No one is safe unless everyone is safe" to emphasize the need for equitable vaccination.
The Facility set a goal of supplying COVID‑19 vaccines to nearly 100 low-to-middle income countries that could not afford them.
COVAX sought to fundraise US$6.8 billion to purchase and deliver vaccines to participating countries in proportion to their populations.
On 18 December 2020, the Facility announced agreements with vaccine manufacturers to supply 1.3  billion doses for 92 low-middle income countries in the first half of 2021.Yet, by mid-December, some 16 countries representing only 14% of the world's population had preordered more than 10 billion vaccine doses or about 51% of the available world supply.
Specifically, Canada, Australia, and Japan – having only 1% of the world's COVID‑19 cases – had collectively reserved some one billion vaccine doses, while the COVAX Facility had reserved only a few hundred million doses.
Concerns were raised that wealthy countries may receive their vaccines in 2020–21 while developing countries may be excluded from vaccinations until 2023–24.
Data from April 2021 comports with this expectation since 25% of the population in high income countries have been vaccinated compared to only 0.2% in low income countries.
Preorders from rich countries were made during 2020 with 13 different vaccine manufacturers, whereas those for low-to-middle income countries were made primarily for the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, which is lowest in cost and has no special refrigeration needs.
CEPI, WHO, and charitable vaccine organizations, such as the Gates Foundation and GAVI, raised over US$20 billion during the first half of 2020 to fund vaccine development and preparedness for vaccinations, particularly for children in under-developed countries.
CEPI, which was created to monitor fair distribution of infectious disease vaccines to low-
and middle-income countries, has recommended considering manufacturing capacity, financing and purchasing, and releasing vaccine developers from liability.
Despite opposition from some vaccine manufacturers, CEPI revised its February 2020 equitable access policy to apply specifically to its COVID‑19 vaccine funding:

"prices for vaccines will be set as low as possible for territories that are or may be affected by an outbreak of a disease for which CEPI funding was used to develop a vaccine;
"information, know-how and materials related to vaccine development must be shared with (or transferred to) CEPI" so that it can assume responsibility for vaccine development if a company discontinues expenditures for a promising vaccine candidate;
CEPI would have access to, and possible management of, intellectual property rights (i.e., patents) for promising vaccines;
"CEPI would receive a share of financial benefits that might accrue from CEPI-sponsored vaccine development, to re-invest in support of its mission to provide global public health benefit"; and
data transparency among development partners should maintain the WHO Statement on Public Disclosure of Clinical Trial Results, and require results to be published in open-access publications.
International groups, such as the Centre for Artistic Activism and Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, advocate for equitable access.
Scientists have encouraged collaboration between the WHO, CEPI, corporations, and governments to ensure that vaccines are distributed in an evidence-based manner based on infection risk and to prioritize healthcare workers, vulnerable populations, and children.
The first polio vaccine was never patented; similar treatment of an effective COVID‑19 vaccine could enable fair distribution.
Negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to waive patent rights have been blocked due to resistance by the US, Switzerland, Norway, and the EU.
Initially one observer considered the US position unlikely to change, but as of April 2021 the US administration is discussing the merits of waiving the patent rights.
However, some question if patent waiver proposals formulated for easy-to-copy small molecule drugs can be applied to more complex biologics like vaccines.

A patent waiver would not force a vaccine manufacturer to disclose the complete knowledge necessary to make a vaccine (which is not found in patents).
Moderna has also stated that it will not seek enforcement of its patents during the pandemic.
The WHO has promoted the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool to facilitate such disclosures but participation is voluntary and none of the vaccine manufacturers have joined.
Without this knowledge, reverse engineering the process is difficult with no guarantee of success.
One financial analyst specializing in pharmaceuticals estimated that it would take a minimum of two years after patent waiver for the first independent reproductions of a COVID-19 vaccine to reach the market, which may be too long to have any net impact on global public health.
While discussing the idea of "open source" COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing, Bill Gates said: "There’s not a single additional vaccine that would have come out of that."
His foundation has instead helped other countries reach licensing deals as in the case of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine being produced by India's Serum Institute.
Some conclude that voluntary technology transfers are the superior option for producing more doses—since the transferor's active assistance can help the transferee bypass time-consuming clinical trials by taking advantage of existing approvals for the transferor's vaccine—and others describe patent waiver proposals as "more symbolic than practical".
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has rejected the dichotomy between waiving patents and initiating technology transfers, including both in four steps to increase vaccine production.
400 non-profit organizations and 115 members of the European Commission signed a letter urging the United States and Europe to side with the WTO members in the global south.
Several have pointed out that a broad patent waiver would lead to Pfizer and Moderna giving up control over the technology of RNA therapeutics, not just the COVID-19 vaccine.
Howard Dean has accused Narendra Modi of trying to gain entry into this market by promoting the "disingenuous" claim that patent waivers will accelerate vaccine production.
By mid-March 2021, 67 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, had not yet reported any vaccinations.
Countries that had begun vaccinations were generally prioritizing populations such as health workers or the elderly.
It has also been suggested that elective surgery recipients should be prioritized since a patient recovering from surgery would be more vulnerable than average.
Some expressed concern over the short shelf-life of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which expire within hours after being removed from the freezer; they argued that, once the vaccine is unfrozen, it is better to apply these doses to anyone who can be found rather than discard the doses.
As of March 2021, the United States had ordered twice the necessary doses to cover its own population, but it remained unclear when it might share surplus doses with other countries.
In April 2021, Vanity Fair reported that it would be difficult to share surplus doses with other countries because the U.S. government had expressly agreed in its contracts with vaccine manufacturers to use doses only in the United States and its territories.
The manufacturers requested this clause because most other countries do not have liability protections as expansive as those in the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.

===
Sovereignty ===
Favored distribution of vaccines within one or a few select countries, called "vaccine sovereignty", is a criticism of some of the vaccine development partnerships, such as for the AstraZeneca-University of Oxford vaccine candidate, concerning whether there may be prioritized distribution first within the UK and to the "highest bidder" – the United States, which made an advance payment of US$1.2 billion to secure 300 million vaccine doses for Americans, even before the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine or a Sanofi vaccine was proved safe or effective.
Concerns exist about whether some countries producing vaccines may impose protectionist controls by export restrictions that would stockpile a COVID‑19 vaccine for their own population.
The Chinese government pledged in May that a successful Chinese vaccine would become a "global, public good", implying enough doses would be manufactured for both national and global distribution.
Unlike mRNA vaccines, which have to be stored at subzero temperatures, inactivated vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm require ordinary refrigeration and may have more appeal in developing countries.
In June, the Serum Institute of India (SII) – a major manufacturer of global vaccines – reached a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca to make 1 billion doses of vaccine for low-and-middle income countries, of which half of the doses would go to India.
Similar preferential homeland distribution may exist if a vaccine is manufactured in Australia.

===
Illegal distribution ===
In the United States, the vaccine distribution line, while varying by state, has placed healthcare workers and senior citizens high on the list for COVID-19 vaccination, while less essential workers are secondary recipients.
Due to the long process of distribution, some individuals tried to secure a more favorable position on the vaccination list, such as by bribery or making donations to hospitals.
In response, state governments imposed large fines and other penalties for violation of federal vaccine distribution guidelines.
A COVID-19 vaccine black market enabled some individuals to buy illegal early access to a vaccine.
By mid-February 2021, China had arrested 80 people involved in vaccine contraband, and the Colombian government intercepted a freezer with 70 doses of a Chinese-manufactured vaccine that a traveler brought with her into the airport without any accompanying paperwork.
===
Vaccine tourism ===
In the later half of February 2021, it was reported that wealthy and influential people from Canada and European countries flew to the United Arab Emirates to secure early access to the vaccine.
The UAE has been promoting Dubai as a vaccine holiday hub for the super-rich, who can pay a hefty amount to skip the queue and get inoculated before the vulnerable ones.
Some Canadians who maintained second homes in the United States were able to get vaccines earlier.
As restrictions on vaccine eligibility were lowered in the United States, wealthier individuals from other countries with slower vaccination rates were reportedly travelling to the United States to be vaccinated.
The U.S. state of Alaska announced in April 2021 that it would intentionally offer free vaccinations to tourists at major Alaskan airports starting June 1, 2021.
In an effort to guard against vaccine tourism, Greece restricted its eligibility to those with a social security number.
However, this had the effect of excluding part of the elderly or immigrant population as well as some Greek citizens who worked abroad before the pandemic.
In Europe, several travel agencies are offering "vaccine vacations".
The Maldives are also offering vaccines as part of holiday travel packages.

Cost ==
An effective vaccine for COVID‑19 could save trillions of dollars in global economic impact, according to economists Arnab Acharya and Sanjay Reddy who advocate suspending patent protections for vaccines temporarily and compensating the affected companies.
Any price tag in the billions would therefore look small in comparison.
In early stages of the pandemic, it was not known if it would be possible to create a safe, reliable and affordable vaccine for this virus, and it was not known exactly how much the vaccine development could cost.
Even with several vaccines on the market, the antigenicity changes in new variants of the virus mean that the billions of dollars could still be invested without success.
Before an effective vaccine was developed, it was clear that billions of doses would need to be manufactured and distributed worldwide.
In April 2020, the Gates Foundation estimated that manufacturing and distribution could cost as much as US$25 billion.
Gates also admitted "Ideally, there would be global agreement about who should get the vaccine first, but given how many competing interests there are, this is unlikely to happen".
From Phase I clinical trials, 84–90% of vaccine candidates fail to make it to final approval during development, and from Phase III, 25.7% fail –
the investment by a manufacturer in a vaccine candidate may exceed US$1 billion and end with millions of useless doses given advanced manufacturing agreements.
In the case of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, 97% of this came from taxpayer money.
As of November 2020, companies subsidized under the United States' Operation Warp Speed program have set initial pricing at US$19.50 to US$25 per dose, in line with the influenza vaccine.
In December 2020, a Belgian politician briefly published the confidential prices agreed between vaccine producers and the EU:


==
Supply chain ==
Deploying a COVID‑19 vaccine may require worldwide transport and tracking of 10–19 billion vial doses, an effort readily becoming the largest supply chain challenge in history.
As of September 2020, supply chain and logistics experts expressed concern that international and national networks for distributing a licensed vaccine were not ready for the volume and urgency, due mainly to deterioration of resources during 2020 pandemic lockdowns and downsizing that degraded supply capabilities.

Globally, supplies critical to vaccine research and development are increasingly scarce due to international competition or national sequestration.
Addressing the worldwide challenge faced by coordinating numerous organizations – the COVAX partnership, global pharmaceutical companies, contract vaccine manufacturers, inter- and intranational transport, vaccine storage facilities, and health organizations in individual countries – Seth Berkley, chief executive of GAVI, stated: "Delivering billions of doses of vaccine to the entire world efficiently will involve hugely complex logistical and programmatic obstacles all the way along the supply chain.
"As
an example highlighting the immensity of the challenge
, the International Air Transport Association stated that 8,000 Boeing 747 cargo planes, equipped for precision vaccine cold storage, would be needed to transport one dose for the entire population in the more than 200 countries experiencing the COVID‑19 pandemic.
GAVI states that "with a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe.
"In
contrast to the multibillion-dollar investment in vaccine technologies and early-stage clinical research, the post-licensing supply chain for a vaccine has not received the same planning, coordination, security or investment.
A major concern is that resources for vaccine distribution in low-
to middle-income countries, particularly for vaccinating children, are inadequate or non-existent, but could be improved with cost efficiencies if procurement and distribution were centralized regionally or nationally.
In September, the COVAX partnership included 172 countries coordinating plans to optimize the supply chain for a COVID‑19 vaccine, and the United Nations Children's Fund joined with COVAX to prepare the financing and supply chain for vaccinations of children in 92 developing countries.

===
Logistics ===
Logistics vaccination services assure necessary equipment, staff, and supply of licensed vaccines across international borders.
Central logistics include vaccine handling and monitoring, cold chain management, and safety of distribution within the vaccination network.
The purpose of the COVAX Facility is to centralize and equitably administer logistics resources among participating countries, merging manufacturing, transport, and overall supply chain infrastructure.
Included are logistics tools for vaccine forecasting and needs estimation, in-country vaccine management, potential for wastage, and stock management.
Other logistics factors conducted internationally during distribution of a COVID‑19 vaccine may include:
visibility and traceability by barcodes for each vaccine vial
sharing of supplier audits
sharing of chain of custody for a vaccine vial from manufacturer to the individual being vaccinated
use of vaccine temperature monitoring tools
temperature stability testing and assurance
new packaging and delivery technologies
stockpiling
coordination of supplies within each country (personal protective equipment, diluent, syringes, needles, rubber stoppers, refrigeration fuel or power sources, waste-handling, among others)
communications technology
environmental impacts in each countryA logistics shortage in any one step may derail the whole supply chain, according to one vaccine developer.
If the vaccine supply chain fails, the economic and human costs of the pandemic may be extended for years.

===
Manufacturing capacity ===
By August 2020, when only a few vaccine candidates were in Phase III trials and were many months away from establishing safety and efficacy, numerous governments pre-ordered more than two billion doses at a cost of more than US$5 billion.
Pre-orders from the British government for 2021 were for five vaccine doses per person, a number dispiriting to organizations like the WHO and GAVI which are promoting fair and equitable access worldwide, especially for developing countries.
In September, CEPI was financially supporting basic and clinical research for nine vaccine candidates, with nine more in evaluation, under financing commitments to manufacture two billion doses of three licensed vaccines by the end of 2021.
Before 2022, 7–10 billion COVID‑19 vaccine doses may be manufactured worldwide, but the sizable pre-orders by affluent countries – called "vaccine nationalism" – threaten vaccine availability for poorer nations.
After joining COVAX in October, China initially stated that it would produce 600 million vaccine doses before the end of 2020 and another one billion doses in 2021.
Sinopharm said it has the capacity to produce 1 billion doses of BBIBP-CorV in 2021, while its Dubai partner G42 Healthcare aimed to produce up to 100 million doses in 2021 focused on the middle east.
Sinovac aimed to complete a second production line by February 2021 to increase production of CoronaVac to 1 billion doses a year, while its Brazilian partner Instituto Butantan planned to produce 100 million doses, and its Indonesian partner Bio Farma planned to produce up to 250 million doses a year.
CanSino Biologics's Ad5-nCoV is also expecting to have a production capacity of 500 million doses in 2021.The Serum Institute of India plans to produce at least one billion vaccine doses, although the institute has stated that half the doses will be used in India.
AstraZeneca CEO, Pascal Soriot, stated: "The challenge is not making the vaccine itself, it's filling vials.
There just aren't enough vials in the world.
"
Preparing for high demand in manufacturing vials, an American glass producer invested $163 million in July for a vial factory.
Glass availability for vial manufacturing and contaminant control are issues of concern, indicating higher production costs with lower profit potential for developers amid demands for vaccines to be affordable.
The RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech are unusually difficult to produce because they rely upon encapsulation of mRNA in lipid nanoparticles, a novel technology which has never been scaled up before for mass production.
As of February 2021, this was thought to be the primary bottleneck in the manufacturing of such vaccines.
Vaccines must be handled and transported according to international regulations, be maintained at controlled temperatures that vary across vaccine technologies, and be used for immunization before deterioration in storage.
The scale of the COVID‑19 vaccine supply chain is expected to be vast to ensure delivery worldwide to vulnerable populations.
Priorities for preparing facilities for such distribution include temperature-controlled facilities and equipment, optimizing infrastructure, training immunization staff, and rigorous monitoring.
RFID technologies are being implemented to track and authenticate a vaccine dose from the manufacturer along the entire supply chain to the vaccination.
In September 2020, Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing agreed with Johnson & Johnson to support the manufacture of its vaccine candidate, including technology transfer and fill and finish manufacturing.
In October 2020, it was announced that the Moderna vaccine candidate will be manufactured in Visp, Switzerland by its partner Lonza Group, which plans to produce the first doses in December 2020.
The newly built 2,000-square-metre facility will ramp up production to 300 million doses annually.
The ingredient will be shipped frozen at −70 °C to Spain's Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi SA for the final stage of manufacturing.
Lonza's site in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, aimed to start making vaccine ingredients exclusively for the U.S. by November 2020.
Compounding the concerns over massive pre-orders by wealthy countries, manufacturing capacity is also limited by the fact that most vaccines are patented by companies in those countries.
India and South Africa proposed a waiver to the TRIPS Agreement which would remove exclusivity agreements as a barrier to setting up new facilities but the measure is being blocked by the G7.
===
Cold chain ===
Different vaccines have different shipping and handling requirements.
For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine must be shipped and stored between −80 and −60 °C (−112 and −76 °F), must be used within five days of thawing, and has a minimum order of 975 doses, making it unlikely to be rolled out in settings other than large, well-equipped hospitals.
The Moderna vaccine vials require storage above −40 °C (−40 °F) and between −25 and −15 °C (−13 and 5 °F).
Once refrigerated, the Moderna vaccine can be kept between 2 and 8 °C (36 and 46 °F) for up to 30 days.
Vaccines (and adjuvants) are inherently unstable during temperature changes, requiring cold chain management throughout the entire supply chain, typically at temperatures of 2–8 °C (36–46 °F).
Because COVID‑19 vaccine technologies are varied among several novel technologies, there are new challenges for cold chain management, with some vaccines that are stable while frozen but liable to heat, while others should not be frozen at all, and some are stable across temperatures.
Freezing damage and inadequate training of personnel in the local vaccination process are major concerns.
If more than one COVID‑19 vaccine is approved, the vaccine cold chain may have to accommodate all these temperature sensitivities across different countries with variable climate conditions and local resources for temperature maintenance.
Sinopharm and Sinovac's vaccines are examples of inactivated vaccines in Phase III testing which can be transported using existing cold chain systems at 2–8 °C
(36–46 °F).modRNA vaccine technologies in development may be more difficult to manufacture at scale and control degradation, requiring ultracold storage and transport.
As examples, Moderna's RNA vaccine candidate requires cold chain management just above freezing temperatures between 2 and 8 °C (36 and 46 °F) with limited storage duration (30 days), but the Pfizer-BioNTech RNA candidate requires storage between −80 and
−60 °C (−112 and −76 °F), or colder throughout deployment until vaccination.
In February 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to update the emergency use authorization (EUA) to permit the vaccine to be stored at between −25 and −15 °C (−13 and 5 °F) for up to two weeks before use.
After a vaccine vial is punctured to administer a dose, it is viable for only six hours, then must be discarded, requiring attention to local management of cold storage and vaccination processes.
Because the COVID‑19 vaccine will likely be in short supply for many locations during early deployment, vaccination staff will have to avoid spoilage and waste, which typically are as much as 30% of the supply.
The cold chain is further challenged by the type of local transportation for the vaccines in rural communities, such as by motorcycle or delivery drone, need for booster doses, use of diluents, and access to vulnerable populations, such as healthcare staff, children and the elderly.
===
Air and land transport ===
Coordination of international air cargo is an essential component of time- and temperature-sensitive distribution of COVID‑19 vaccines, but, as of September 2020, the air freight network is not prepared for multinational deployment. "
Safely delivering COVID‑19 vaccines will be the mission of the century for the global air cargo industry.
But it won't happen without careful advance planning.
And the time for that is now.
We urge governments to take the lead in facilitating cooperation across the logistics chain so that the facilities, security arrangements and border processes are ready for the mammoth and complex task ahead," said IATA's Director General and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac, in September 2020.For the severe reduction in passenger air traffic during 2020, airlines downsized personnel, trimmed destination networks, and put aircraft into long-term storage.
As the lead agencies for procurement and supply of the COVID‑19 vaccine within the WHO COVAX Facility, GAVI and UNICEF are preparing for the largest and fastest vaccine deployment ever, necessitating international air freight collaboration, customs and border control, and possibly as many as 8,000 cargo planes to deliver just one vaccine dose to multiple countries.
Two of the first approved vaccines, Pfizer and BioNTech's Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine and
Moderna's mRNA-1273, must be kept cold during transport.
Keeping the temperatures sufficiently low is accomplished with specially-designed containers and dry ice, but dry ice is only allowed in limited quantities on airplanes as the gases released via sublimation may be toxic.
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) limits the amount of dry ice on a Boeing 777-224 to 3,000 lb (1,400 kg), but it temporarily allowed United Airlines to transport up to 15,000 lb (6,800 kg)—nearly 1 million doses—between Brussels and Chicago.
The CDC has tasked McKesson with vaccine distribution in the US; the company will handle all major vaccines except Pfizer's.
American Airlines, Boeing, and Delta Air Lines are also working to increase dry ice transportation capacity, and American, Delta, and United each operate their own cold storage networks in the US.
FedEx and UPS have installed ultra-cold freezers at air cargo hubs in Europe and North America, and UPS can manufacture 1,200 lb (540 kg) of dry ice per hour.

===
Security and corruption ===
Medicines are the world's largest fraud market, worth some $200 billion per year, making the widespread demand for a COVID‑19 vaccine vulnerable to counterfeit, theft, scams, and cyberattacks throughout the supply chain.
The vaccine has been referred to as "the most valuable asset on earth"; Interpol called it "liquid gold" and warned of an "onslaught of all types of criminal activity".
Anticorruption, transparency, and accountability safeguards are being established to reduce and eliminate corruption of COVID‑19 vaccine supplies.
Absence of harmonized regulatory frameworks among countries, including low technical capacity, constrained access, and ineffective capability to identify and track genuine vs. counterfeit vaccines, may be life-threatening for vaccine recipients, and would potentially perpetuate the COVID‑19 pandemic.
Tracking system technologies for packaging are being used by manufacturers to trace vaccine vials across the supply chain, and to use digital and biometric tools to assure security for vaccination teams.
In December 2020, Interpol warned that organized crime could infiltrate the vaccine supply chain, steal product through physical means, and data theft, or even offer counterfeit vaccine kits.
Further, vaccines which require constant freezing temperatures are also susceptible to sabotage.
GPS devices will be used in the United States to track the vaccines.
In Colorado, the vaccine shipments will be escorted by Colorado State Patrol officers from Denver International Airport to the state's eight distribution points; the exact plans are confidential and law enforcement will "maintain a low-key
profile".
Peripheral businesses may also be affected.
An IBM security analyst told The New York Times that petrochemical companies are being targeted by hackers due to their central role in producing dry ice.
On 21 May 2020, the FDA made public the cease-and-desist notice it had sent to North Coast Biologics, a Seattle-based company that had been selling a purported "nCoV19 spike protein vaccine".
On 21 January 2021, its founder, Johnny Stine, was arrested on a federal warrant charging him with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.
===
National infrastructure ===
The WHO has implemented an "Effective Vaccine Management" system, which includes constructing priorities to prepare national and subnational personnel and facilities for vaccine distribution, including:

Trained staff to handle time- and temperature-sensitive vaccines
Robust monitoring capabilities to ensure optimal vaccine storage and transport
Temperature-controlled facilities and equipment
Traceability
SecurityBorder processes for efficient handling and customs clearance within individual countries may include:
Facilitating flight and landing permits
Exempting flight crews from quarantine requirements
Facilitating flexible operations for efficient national deployment
Granting arrival priority to maintain vaccine temperature requirements


== Liability ==
On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID‑19, covering "any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID‑19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the declaration precludes "liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct".
The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.In
the European Union the COVID‑19 vaccines are licensed under a Conditional Marketing Authorisation which does not exempt manufacturers from civil and administrative liability claims.
While the purchasing contracts with vaccine manufacturers remain secret, the manufacturers remain liable even for side-effects not known at the time of licensure.
Pfizer has been criticised for demanding far-reaching liability waivers and other guarantees from countries such as Argentina and Brazil, which go beyond what was expected from other countries such as the US (above).

The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy is a mass immunization campaign that was put in place by the Italian government in order to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
It started on 27 December 2020, together with most countries in the European Union.

The vaccination campaign was managed by the Ministry of Health and the special commissioner Domenico Arcuri until 1 March 2021, when he was replaced by Army General Francesco Paolo Figliuolo.

==
Vaccination program ==
In the first months of the vaccination campaign, the governmental agencies targeted the health medical and administrative personnel, together with the guests and personnel of nursing homes.
In the second phase of the campaign, elderly people and public service personnel should receive the vaccine.

===
Vaccines ===
The Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the European Commission on 21 December 2020, on the same day after receiving recommendation for granting conditional marketing authorization by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).The Italian government bought, in a coordinated effort with the EU Commission, various types of COVID-19 vaccine, including the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and the ones produced by Moderna, University of Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sanofi, and Johnson & Johnson.

December 2020 ===
The vaccination campaign started on 27 December 2020, when Italy received 9,750 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
These doses were entirely used in the following days to vaccinate part of the medical and health personnel of hospitals.

The Italian vaccination campaign was coordinated and agreed with the European Union (EU).
The EU countries, as per previous agreements, received the vaccine provisions according to a centralized plan developed by the European Commission.
On 30 December 2020, 359,775 doses of vaccine were delivered by Pfizer–BioNTech.
On 31 December 2020, 110,175 doses of vaccine were delivered by Pfizer–BioNTech.
===
January 2021 ===
From 30 December 2020 to 1 January 2021, 469,950 doses of vaccine were delivered by Pfizer-BioNTech.
From 5 January 2021 to 7 January 2021, Pfizer-BioNTech delivered another 438 750 doses.
This type of vaccine must be stored at -70 °C.
The first Italian region to start with vaccinations was Lazio, at the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome.
Subsequently, the vaccines were distributed in the other Italian regions.

On 6 January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave its authorization for the Moderna vaccine.
At 8 pm on 7 January 2021, 379,910 people were vaccinated in Italy.

According to a scientific study of COVID-19 virology, the Pfizer–BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine also protects against the two mutations of the virus that have spread in the United Kingdom and South Africa.

Both strains share a common mutation called N501Y, a slight alteration at one point in the protein that covers the virus.
On 10 January 2021, the Campania region in Italy had the highest percentage of administration compared to the doses possessed.
It also claimed to have exhausted the stock.
On 11 January 2021, 75,075 doses of vaccine were delivered by Pfizer–BioNTech.
On 12 January 2021, 47,000 doses of vaccine were delivered by Moderna.
On 11 and 12 January 2021, 488,475 doses were delivered.
Pfizer has reduced vaccine availability by 29% as of Monday, January 18, 2021.

On 16 January  2021, 800 doses of Moderna vaccine were lost due to freezer failure in Forlì.
On 18 and 19 January 2021, there are further delays and reductions in the number of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.
On January 20, 2021, the vaccination campaign was slowed down due to a lack of vaccine stock.
On January 21, 2020, AstraZeneca delays the delivery of the vaccine and reduces the expected quantities for deliveries across Europe.
The delay in vaccine supply is delaying the vaccination campaign.
On January 29, 2021, Moderna also cut vaccine supplies by 20%.
About 300,000 doses are missing in the supply of vaccines provided for in the agreements with Moderna.
The European Union is in sharp confrontation with AstraZeneca on the timing and quantity of vaccine supplies.
This leads to a serious delay in the Italian and European vaccination campaign.
On January 30, 2021, AIFA limits the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine from 18 to 55 years.

=== February 2021 ===
On 2 February 2021, the vaccination campaign is slowing sharply due to a lack of deliveries of vaccines by pharmaceutical companies.
On 6 February 2021, the first 249,600 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Italy.
On 12 February 2021, the Genoese architect Renzo Piano was the first to undergo vaccination on Silver Vaccine Day that opens the vaccination campaign for the persons over 80 years old in Liguria.
On 17 February 2021, AIFA extend the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine until 65 years old.
On 18 February 2021, the senator for life, Liliana Segre was vaccinated at Fatebenefratelli Hospital in Milan.
She was received by the President of the Lombardy Region, Attilio Fontana, and the Vice President and Assessor of Welfare, Letizia Moratti.
On 20 February 2021, AstraZeneca reduced vaccine supplies by 15%.On 23 February 2021
, AstraZeneca plans to supply less than half of the doses of vaccine preordered to the European Union.
On 26 February 2021, the  vaccination clinics increased to 1436, up from the initial 293.

===
March 2021 ===
On 1 March 2021, The General of the Italian Army Francesco Paolo Figliuolo is the new special commissioner to replace Domenico Arcuri.
On 9 March 2021, The President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella was vaccinated in the Spallanzani Hospital.
The president was given a dose of Moderna vaccine.
On 11 March 2021, AIFA banned the use in Italy of a batch (number ABV2856) of the AstraZeneca vaccine for checks in relation to the deaths of two men in Sicily after administration of the vaccine.
On 15 March 2021, AIFA suspends the Astrazeneca vaccine throughout Italy on a temporary basis for investigations into death cases after vaccination.
On 19 March 2021, AIFA revoked the ban for AstraZeneca, vaccinations have resumed.
On 20 March 2021, the special commissioner, Army General Francesco Paolo Figliuolo and the chief of Protezione Civile Fabrizio Curcio were vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.
On 25 March 2021, the name of the AstraZeneca vaccine was changed to Vaxzevria in the European Union.

On 30 March 2021, Prime Minister Mario Draghi and his wife Maria Serenella Cappello were vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the Termini station hub in Rome, as required by the Lazio Region vaccination plan.

=== April 2021 ===
On 6 April 2021, AstraZeneca postpones delivery of 50% doses scheduled for 14 April 2021.Meanwhile, Oxford University's Jenner Institute is suspending testing of the vaccine on children.
The Oxford University's Jenner Institute decision was made pending an analysis of the possible links between the drug and episodes of thrombosis among adults.
In Italy, 54% of doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered to date (2,218,038 out of 4,098,800 delivered), according to the Ministero della Salute, while for Moderna vaccine the percentage drops to 50% (658,403 out of 1,328,200).
Pfizer vaccine has a 96% administration rate, (8,375,625 out of 8,709,480).
In total, out of 14,136,480 doses of the three vaccines arrived in Italy, 11,252,066 were administered, about 80%.

On 13 April 2021, 184,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine arrived in Italy, however Johnson & Johnson announced that it would delay deliveries of its vaccines to Europe.
AIFA has cautiously suspended distribution to vaccination centers pending information from the United States where the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been suspended for investigation into suspicious deaths and thrombosis disorders following the administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
On 22 April 2021, Johnson & Johnson vaccine started to administration in Italy.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, cordons sanitaires and similar restrictions have been implemented in numerous countries and territories around the world.
These restrictions were established to reduce the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19.
By April 2020, about half of the world's population was under lockdown, with more than 3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments.
Although similar disease control measures have been used for hundreds of years, the scale seen in the 2020s is thought to be unprecedented.
Research and case studies have shown that lockdowns are effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted.
To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the WHO recommends a response to the pandemic that consists of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.
Countries and territories around the world have enforced lockdowns of varying stringency.
Some include total movement control while others have enforced restrictions based on time.
In many cases, only essential businesses are allowed to remain open.
Schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 63 countries, affecting approximately 47 percent of the world's student population.
Beginning with the first lockdown in China's Hubei province in January 2020 and the entirety of Italy in March, lockdowns continued to be implemented in many countries throughout 2020 and 2021.
On 24 March 2020, the entire 1.3 billion population of India was ordered to stay at home during its lockdown, making it the largest of the pandemic.
Pandemic restrictions have had social and economic impacts, and have been met with protests in some territories.

==
Efficacy ==
Several researchers, from modelling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns are effective at reducing the spread of, and deaths caused by, COVID-19.
Lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing COVID-19 community transmission, healthcare costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater stringency, and when not lifted too early.
A study investigating the spread based on studies of the most common symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in France, Italy and the UK showed a marked decrease in new symptoms just a few days after the start of confinement on the countries (Italy and France) with the strongest lockdowns.
Modelling on the United States pandemic suggested "the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier" and that the second wave would have been less severe had the lockdown lasted another two weeks.
The stringent lockdown in Hubei in early 2020 proved effective at controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
The relatively high number of cases and deaths in Sweden, which has kept much of its society open during the pandemic, when compared to its neighbors with comparable demographics Norway, Denmark and Finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to at least partly attributable to this difference in policy.
Similarly, modelling on Australian data concluded that achieving zero community transmission through a strict lockdown lowers healthcare and economic costs compared to less stringent measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early relaxation of restrictions have greater costs.
This "zero community transmission" approach was adopted in Australia, and a strict four month lockdown in the state of Victoria during an outbreak in Melbourne, combined with other measures, averted a wider outbreak in the country.
New Zealand and Vietnam's successful containment measures have included targeted lockdowns.

===
Voluntary versus mandatory restrictions ===
One study led by an economist at the University of Chicago found that involuntary lockdowns had little impact, with voluntary distancing making up nearly 90% of the fall in consumer traffic as people feared the virus itself.
Similarly, a NBER study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just 5–10%.
Another study from Yale University found that most social distancing was voluntary, driven primarily by "media coverage of morbidity and mortality.
"On
the other hand, some studies have argued that coercive measures probably decreased interactions, while accepting that most of the reduction may have been voluntary.
One of those two studies, by Flaxman et al.,
has been criticized, among other things for having a country-specific adjustment factor, without which the model would predict a massive number of deaths for Sweden.
One widely cited economic simulation asserting that shelter-in-place orders reduced total cases three-fold, however, held voluntary distancing constant.
Another study found a 30% difference among border-counties where stay-at-home orders were imposed.
Another study that compared the impact of 'less restrictive interventions' on the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden and South Korea, with mandatory stay-at home orders in 8 other countries, such as France and Spain, did not find evidence for greater disease control in the countries with more restrictions.
However, the findings of the study have been questioned due to its numerous limitations, including the small sample size of countries.
Some research has also found that an "advisory" approach is not adequate to control COVID-19 outbreaks.
An analysis of an outbreak in northern Italy found that an effective reduction in community transmission occurred during a strict national lockdown, and that earlier less stringent measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a level low enough to reduce the spread of COVID-19.Since
the beginning of the pandemic, Google has consistently collected data on movements, showing rapid declines in public activity long before legal restrictions were imposed.
An April poll found that 93% of Americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal restrictions.

== Reception ==
A review of 348 articles on non-pharmaceutical interventions concluded unanimously an acknowledgement of their importance in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
However, current research also acknowledges high societal costs.

===
Related to epidemiology ===
During the early stages of the pandemic in Europe and the United States, statistical modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a large number of deaths were used as the basis for lockdowns.
This includes an Imperial College projection, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson.
Despite some criticisms, academics defended the Imperial projection as fundamentally sound, while admitting the code was "a buggy mess.
"A notable opponent included Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who has frequently criticised lockdowns.
The Swedish government's strategy included minimal restrictions and has been controversial, in part due to the relatively high death toll due to widespread transmission.
However, the Swedish government began considering enacting a lockdown in early 2021.American global health physicians Ranu Dhillon and Abraar Karan have argued for "smarter lockdowns" which use granular epidemiological data to only impose restrictions on areas with high levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable populations in these locations to offset the economic costs.

===
Related to social impacts ===
Some commentators have suggested that states' use of emergency powers to curb freedom of assembly and movement are authoritarian and may result in long-term democratic backsliding.
Centralization of power by political leadership in Hungary, Poland, China and Cambodia in response to the pandemic have been cited as examples.
Some researchers have noted that pandemic restrictions have come with mental health costs.
UN Women warned in a April 2020 report that pandemic restrictions exacerbate gender inequalities and have led to an increase in domestic violence.
Many women are being forced to ‘lockdown’ at home with their abusers at the same time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.
For instance, in France there was a spike in cases of about 30% since the lockdown in March 2020.

===
Related to economic impacts ===
Economists generally supported increased government funding for mitigation efforts, even at the cost of tolerating a very large economic contraction.
They agreed that lockdowns should continue until the threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only the economic impact.
There was consensus, at least in some economic circles, that "severe lockdowns — including closing non-essential businesses and strict limitations on people's movement — are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less aggressive measures".

Both the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published statements noting the impact of the lockdowns on livelihoods and food security, and Dr David Nabarro, WHO Special Envoy on COVID-19 stated in October 2020 that "lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer".
===
Protests ===
There have also been a number of protests over responses to the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, some of which were specifically in opposition to lockdowns, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand.
The motivations for and sizes of these protests have varied.
Some have been spurred by the economic and social impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the pandemic, conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination.

==
Table of pandemic lockdowns ==
In the table pandemic lockdowns are defined as the shutdown of parts of the economy, due to non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures and are enforceable by law like:

Closing of schools and kindergartens
Closing of non-essential shops (shops and stores apart from food, doctors and drug stores)
Closing of non-essential production
Cancellation of recreational venues and closing of public places
Curfews
Stay-at-home orders and
total movement controlThese measures are considered to have caused the COVID-19 recession in 2020.

The table does not contain:

Measures with smaller economic impacts like:
border closures
social distancing measures and social movement restrictions
travel restrictions.

Other non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures like mandatory quarantines after travel, self quarantine and social distancing measures
Any measures which are voluntary rather than enforceable by lawThe pandemic has resulted in the largest number of shutdowns/lockdowns worldwide at the same time in history..
By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April – more than half of the world's population.
Restrictions first began in China, with other countries in East Asia like Vietnam soon following it in implementing widespread containment measures.
Much of Europe, North America and Africa took much longer to bring in tough measures.
Lockdowns between and within nations are of varying stringency.
By mid April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, around 100 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion were under lockdown in India; the largest of all lockdowns.
By the end of April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in various countries of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom; while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.

The situation of women in the world of work ====
Due to the pandemic, the employment situation of a big percentage of the population has changed.
A lot of people have lost their jobs or have had their salary and working hours reduced.
Moreover, most of the companies and their employees have had difficulties in adapting to teleworking.
The impact can be seen in a study made by the National University of Santiago del Estero, which reports how the Argentinean government's measures to stop the expansion of COVID-19 have affected society, focusing on the Social, Preventive and Compulsory Isolation, in the work context of Argentina and Mar de Plata.
Particularly, it analyses the situation in two sectors which are mainly occupied by women and which have been severely affected by the pandemic: domestic and unpaid care work.
This new reality has mainly affected women, as not only do they have to cope with their working hours (paid or unpaid), but they are also responsible for the care of dependent people, in most of the cases.
This situation is even worse when there are children living with them due to the closure of educational centers as a result of the pandemic.
Thus, the number of hours that women dedicate to household and care tasks has considerably increased .
A 43% of salaried women and 76% of unpaid women are doing these tasks right now (Actis Di Pasquale, Barboni, Florio, Ibarra, & Savino, 2020).
At the same time, this group tends to have precarious, irregular or even unpaid jobs.
The pandemic has also led to a wave of dismissals, more than half of which have been made in jobs occupied by women.
In addition, 65% of the jobs that were suspended during the quarantine belonged to women.
In the case of Mar de Plata, only 13.1% of women work in domestic service compared to 0.1% of men.
Moreover, at national level, approximately 90% of women report that they perform unpaid work at their houses (Actis di Pasquale, Barboni, Florio, Ibarra, & Sabino, 2020).
These data show both the high female presence in this area and the fact that the pandemic has particularly affected women's role in the world of work and in their households.

===
Australia ===
A number of Australian states, territories, and cities have implemented lockdowns in response to the pandemic.
The country entered a general nationwide lockdown on 23 March 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, which was lifted on 15 May.
The state of Victoria, particularly its capital city of Melbourne, the country's second most populous city with five million residents, entered an extended lockdown on 7 July 2020 in response to a rapidly growing community outbreak.
Initial measures included the closure of all non-essential services, including retail and gyms.
Hospitality establishments were permitted to open in take-away and delivery capacities only.
Schools and childcare facilities were also ordered to close.
Face coverings were made mandatory as of 23 July 2020, with a fine of $200 AUD for non-compliance to those above 12 years of age, although formal exemptions could be acquired.
Initially scheduled to last six weeks, restrictions were tightened further on 2 August after cases continued to grow, including a ban on travel further than a five kilometre radius from place of residence, a nighttime curfew of 8 PM to 5 AM, a one-hour limit on outdoor exercise, a one-person per day limit on shopping for essentials, and public gatherings limited to a maximum of two people.
Restrictions were progressively eased as the case rate declined, and were completely lifted on 28 October.
With a total duration of 112 days, the Victorian lockdown was the longest continuous period of COVID-19 lockdown globally as of October 2020.Brief "
snap lockdowns" in response to new clusters, particularly of the UK and South African strains, have been implemented at various times across the country, including in Adelaide (19–22 November), Sydney's Northern Beaches (19 December 2020 – 10 January 2021), Greater Brisbane (8–11 January and 29 March–1 April), Perth, Peel, and the South West (31 January–5 February), and across Victoria (13–17 February).
===
Cambodia ===
On April 15, 2021, Cambodia's government enacted a strict stay-at-home order across the entirety of Phnom Penh and Ta Khmau in response to the country's largest COVID-19 outbreak of the pandemic.
Certain districts were declared as "red zones", banning people from leaving their homes except for medical emergencies.
Sihanoukville also entered a lockdown on April 24.

===
Canada ===
On January 25, 2020, the first identified presumptive case in Canada was a 56-year-old male who had travelled to Wuhan, China, before returning to Toronto on 22 January.
Canada issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to China due to the outbreak, including a regional travel advisory to avoid all travel to the province of Hubei.

Federal health officials stated that the risk in Canada was low.

On January 26, 2020, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam tweeted, "There is no clear evidence that this virus is spread easily from person to person.
The risk to Canadians remains low.
"Three days later, on January 29, Dr. Tam told Canadians that "It's going to be rare, but we are expecting cases.
"On
February 1, the position of the prime minister and the administration remained that it would be discriminatory to exclude travellers from China, the source (and, at the time, still the epicentre) of the disease.
During March, Canadian provinces implemented lockdowns in response to COVID-19.

Ontario, the country's most populous province, had its first provincewide lockdown starting on December 26, 2020.
The lockdown was strengthened with a stay-at-home order effective January 14, 2021, and reopened on a regional basis starting February 10.
As a result of the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the province caused by COVID-19 variants, the government of Ontario once again announced a four-week provincewide shutdown effective April 3.
This shutdown was once again strengthened with another 28-day stay-at-home order starting April 8, in order to quickly combat the urgent crisis in the province's hospital capacity being caused by the variants.

===
China ===
China was the first country to enforce the quarantine and lockdown of cities and later whole provinces in late January.
Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said he personally authorized the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning on 23 January.
Although such measures are a very old tool of epidemic control, their use at the scale of a large city such as Wuhan or the even larger scale of provinces was controversial among experts at the time, with questions about their effectiveness and their ethics.
Some public health experts, while not always condemning the measure, raised the issue of the inevitable psychological toll such measures would have.
An ex-World Health Organization (WHO) official who headed the organization's Western Pacific Region during the SARS outbreak said that "the containment of a city [hadn't] been done in the history of international public health policy".
The WHO called the decision to quarantine Wuhan "new to science".
By early April, all lockdowns had ended or relaxed to a certain degree as the cases started to dwindle and the outbreak had come under control.
===
Fiji ===
On 19 March 2020, Fiji confirmed its first case in Lautoka.
In response, the Government of Fiji ordered the lockdown of the city on 20 March with closures of all schools and non-essential services all over the country.
On 3 April 2020, Fiji's capital, Suva, went into lockdown after confirming two new cases.
More than 300,000 residents were confined to their homes and all non-essential services in the city was closed for two weeks.
On 19 April 2021, Nadi and Lautoka went into lockdown after recording its first community transmission in one year.

===
France ===
From 17 March 2020, all people in France were required to complete and carry an exemption form to leave their homes and can be fined for non-essential journeys.
Essential journeys include shopping for food, travelling to and from work, accessing healthcare, and exercising within 1 km of the home for up to 1 hour.
Police around the country had set up road blocks to check people who were out and about had good reason and that their exemption declarations were in order.
These measures were lifted on 11 May 2020, with remaining restrictions on travel further than 100 km away from one's residence.
The latter restrictions were lifted on 2 June 2020.

On 28 October, president Emmanuel Macron announced a second lockdown until at least 1 December 2020.
During this second lockdown, schools remain open and more industries can keep operating (construction, public services...).
Like the first lockdown, citizens need to sign their certificates to can go around within 1 km up to hour per day.
Fines are 135 euros the 1st time, 200 euros for 2 times within 15 days and 3750 euros and 6 months jail sentence for 3 times within 30 days.

Ireland ===
On 12 March, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities in Ireland until the end of August.
On 27 March, Varadkar announced a national stay-at-home order for at least two weeks; the public were ordered to stay at home in all circumstances.
All non-essential shops and services, including all pubs, bars, hotels and nightclubs closed and all public and private gatherings of any number of people was banned.
The Garda Síochána (Irish police) were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May.
A roadmap to easing restrictions in Ireland that includes five stages was adopted by the government on 1 May 2020 and subsequently published online.
On 5 June, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a series of changes to the government's roadmap of easing COVID-19 restrictions in Ireland, which he summed up as: "Stay Local".
The fourth and final phase of easing COVID-19 restrictions in Ireland was initially scheduled to take place on 20 July, but was repeatedly postponed until 31 August at the earliest.
On 7 August, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced a regional lockdown and a series of measures for counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly following significant increases of COVID-19 cases in the three counties, which came into effect from midnight and will remain in place for two weeks.
On 21 August, localised restrictions in Laois and Offaly were lifted, but was extended for another two weeks in Kildare.
Restrictions in Kildare were lifted by the government with immediate effect on 31 August.
On 15 September, the Government of Ireland announced a medium-term plan for living with COVID-19 that includes five levels of restrictions, with the entire country at Level 2 and specific restrictions in Dublin.
All non-essential businesses and services closed and all public and private gatherings of any number of people was banned again on 21 October following the Government's announcement to move the entire country to Level 5 lockdown restrictions for six weeks until 1 December.
On 27 November, the Government of Ireland agreed to ease restrictions from 1 December.
A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland on 21 December.
The Government of Ireland acted swiftly and on 22 December, Level 5 lockdown restrictions (subject to a number of adjustments) were announced, which came into effect from 24 December (Christmas Eve) until 12 January 2021 at the earliest.
All non-essential businesses and services closed and all public and private gatherings of any number of people was banned again on 31 December (New Year's Eve) following the Government's announcement to move the entire country to full Level 5 lockdown restrictions from 30 December until 31 January 2021 at the earliest, in an attempt to get a third surge in cases of COVID-19 under control.
On 26 January, the Government extended the Level 5 lockdown restrictions until 5 March.
On 23 February, the Government extended the Level 5 lockdown restrictions for another six weeks until 5 April (Easter Monday) at the earliest, while its new revised Living with COVID-19 plan was published.
On 30 March, the Government announced a phased easing of restrictions from Monday 12 April.
On 29 April, the Government announced a reopening plan for the country throughout May and June from 10 May.


===
Italy ===
On 9 March 2020, the government of Italy under Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a national quarantine, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances, in response to the growing pandemic of COVID-19 in the country.
Additional lockdown restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses.
This followed a restriction announced on the previous day which affected sixteen million people in the whole region of Lombardy and in fourteen largely-neighbouring provinces in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont and Marche, and prior to that a smaller-scale lockdown of ten municipalities in the province of Lodi and one in the province of Padua that had begun in late February.
The restrictions were loosened in May 2020.

The lockdown measures, despite being widely approved by the public opinion, were also described as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the republic.
Nevertheless, Article 16 of the Constitution states that travel restrictions may be established for reasons of health or security.

===
Malaysia ===
Malaysia introduced the nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020, which was initially announced to last to 14 April but was extended several times.
The MCO prohibited mass gatherings, movement within the country, and most industries and all education institutions were ordered to close.
Extended Movement Control Orders (EMCO) were implemented in areas where suspected superspreading events or widespread transmission had occurred.
Royal Malaysian Police were mobilized to enforce restrictions.
These restrictions were later eased under the "Conditional MCO" (CMCO), which maintained some restrictions on assembly and movement but allowed some sectors to reopen which was later further relaxed to the "Recovery MCO" (RMCO) nationwide.
Localized CMCOs restrictions were introduced in the states of Sabah and Selangor were later introduced in response to outbreaks in those states.
The MCO was reinstated nationwide in January 2021.

===
Myanmar ===
In September 2020, Myanmar introduced a strict stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire for the entirety of the country's largest city Yangon amid a major local outbreak.
All non-essential businesses were ordered to close.
The city's 4 million residents were given less than 24 hours notice before the lockdown came into effect.

===
Namibia ===
Beginning 27 March, a 21-day lockdown of the regions of Erongo and Khomas was announced.
On 14 April the lockdown was extended to
4 May. It now officially applied to all regions, although the stay-at-home order was already enforced countrywide.
Only essential businesses remained open.
Schools were closed, parliamentary sessions suspended, and generally all gatherings of more than 10 people were prohibited.
Formal and informal bars were closed and the sale of alcohol prohibited.
This "stage 1" of the lockdown was in force until 4 May 2020.
From then on, regulations are to be gradually eased.

===
New Zealand ===
On 23 March 2020, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern raised New Zealand's COVID-19 alert level to three and announced the closure of all schools beginning on that day, and two days later moved to four at 11:59 p.m. on 25 March 2020 – a nationwide lockdown.
While all sporting matches and events as well as non-essential services such as pools, bars, cafes, restaurants, playgrounds closed, essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations, and health services remained open.
The alert level was moved back down to Level 3 at 11:59 pm on 27 April, and moved to Level 2 at 11:59 pm on 13 May, lifting the rest of the lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing.
On 8 June, Prime Minister Ardern announced that New Zealand would be entering into Alert Level 1 at midnight on 9 June, lifting restrictions on daily life, business activities, mass gatherings and public transportation.
However, the country's borders would remain closed to most international travel.
Following a new outbreak consisting of four cases of community transmission in Auckland on 11 August, the Government placed the Auckland Region on a Level 3 lockdown from 12:00 am on 12 August while the rest of the country move to Level 2 at the same time.
On 30 August, Prime Minister Ardern announced that Auckland would enter into "Alert Level 2.5" from 11:59pm on that night while the rest of the country would remain on Level 2.
Under Level 2.5, all social gatherings including birthday parties will be limited to ten people; masks will be mandatory for all Aucklanders using public transportation; and aged care facilities will be operating under strict conditions.
The only public gatherings allowed in Auckland are funerals and tangihanga, which will be limited to 50 people.

United Kingdom ===
Health in the UK is devolved to each of the four nations, and lockdown is decided by each government separately (the UK Government acting on behalf of England only).

The initial announcement, however, was done by Boris Johnson, with agreement from the other three heads of government.
At 8:30 p.m. on 23 March 2020, Boris Johnson announced a stay-at-home order effective immediately, though only legally effective from 1:00 p.m. on 26 March 2020, through The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions)
(England) Regulations 2020.
The slogan "Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" was used in England.
All non-essential shops and services were ordered to close, throughout the UK and police were granted powers to issue fines, send people home, especially persons suspected of being infected, and to break up gatherings of more than two people.
The British population was instructed to stay home, except for exercise once a day (such as running, walking or cycling), shopping for essential items, any medical need, providing care to a vulnerable person, or travelling to work where the work in question was vital and could not be done from home.
Johnson stated that the stay-at-home order would be reviewed every three weeks.
Working with general practitioners, the four NHS bodies strongly advised (though did not mandate) that those at the highest risk of severe complications from COVID-19 follow special shielding measures.
These included not leaving their home at all, even for essential reasons, and keeping two meters apart from other household members.

On 11 May, following the initial lockdown announcement, the UK-wide rules fractured and separate rules were announced at various times by the four governments of the United Kingdom:


====
Wales ====
On 26 March the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Wales)
Regulations 2020 were approved by the Welsh Parliament, giving the Welsh Government emergency powers to deal with various aspects of managing the pandemic.
These new powers include the authority to:
Take people into or keep them in quarantine
Restrict or prohibit mass gatherings
Close premises"Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives"
slogan rejected and "Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" was used.
On 23 October, Wales commenced a partial lockdown.

On 26 March, Snowdon and other Welsh mountains were closed to the public, after a larger number of English tourists had gathered on the mountains in the preceding days, causing traffic mayhem.
Natural Resources Wales later announced that all sites and paths liable to have large amounts of people visiting, or pose a high risk, would be closed.

By 27 March, North Wales Police were patrolling the border between Wales and England because visitors were ignoring the stay-at-home instructions and travelling into Wales.
In many cases the police were stopping cars entering from England; such border control had not happened between Wales and England since the 16th century.
On 8 May, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that the COVID-19 lockdown in Wales would be extended for a further three weeks.
He also announced "modest" changes to the measures already in force: some garden centres would be allowed to re-open, and people could now exercise outdoors more than once per day provided that they "stay
local".
On 3 June, Welsh Government briefings began (later referred to as 'press conferences') in a series that was set up by Welsh Government as a way of dispersing new information to the people of Wales regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales.
These were placed on a CC-BY-SA open licence.

Restrictions were further eased by an announcement on 31 July, confirming that pubs and restaurants would be able to open indoor areas on 3 August.
Up to thirty people would be able to meet outdoors and children under 11 would no longer have to keep a 2-metre (6') distance from anyone.
Indoor bowling alleys, auction houses and bingo halls were allowed to reopen, while swimming pools, gyms, leisure centres and indoor play areas would be allowed to reopen from 10 August, all with social distancing.
Towards the end of August, concerns grew about a potential second spike in infections, after passengers arriving at Cardiff Airport from overseas tested positive for the virus.
The flight operator, TUI Group, was criticised for failing to enforce mask-wearing during the flight.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething later revealed that 30 cases had been linked to four flights into the UK from the island of Zante, and the Welsh and Scottish governments lobbied the UK government to have the island included in the list of quarantine destinations for the UK as a whole.
On 19 October, the Welsh Government announced that a second national lockdown, described as a "fire-break", would be imposed from 23 October until 9 November, coinciding with school half-term holidays which would be extended by a week in colleges and for school students in year 9 (13 to 14 years old) and above, in the hope of bringing down the number of coronavirus cases.
The First Minister announced that all pubs, restaurants, and non-essential shops would be closed during that period.

Announced on 16 December, the Welsh Government planned to go into a full lockdown immediately after the 5-day Christmas period (23-27 December) on 28 December.
However, on 19 December 2020, it was announced that Wales would go into a full lockdown immediately at midnight on 20 December.
The circumstance for the latest lockdown was reviewed every three weeks, but no end date has been announced.
After the firebreak, rules were standardised across Wales with localised restrictions abolished.
From 9 November, pubs, restaurants and cafes reopened with groups of up to four people (children under eleven not counting in the total) from different households allowed to meet up in them; the 10pm curfew for alcohol sales remained in place.
Non essential shops also reopened.
Two households could form a bubble (interact when they wished) whilst any number of children under eleven and up to 15 or 30 individuals over that age could take part in indoor and outdoor organised events respectively.
Travel restrictions within Wales were lifted though non essential visits to other parts of the UK or abroad remained banned.
On 19 December, The First Minister announced that the whole of Wales will enter tier-4 restrictions.
This includes an ongoing national lockdown from that evening.
This follows an outbreak of a mutant strain of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.
Original joint plans of relaxed restrictions from 23 to 28 December were in place for the entire United Kingdom, but this was amended so that the sole relaxed period would consist of Christmas Day, in which only  two households will be allowed to meet.
Before and after Christmas Day, meeting with people from different households, will not be allowed to take place indoors.
Those that do meet with other households outdoors must stay at least 2 meters apart from each other and wear PPE.

====
Northern Ireland ====
"Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives" slogan rejected and "Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" was used.

On 15 April, Arlene Foster, the First Minister of Northern Ireland, extended the period of lockdown in Northern Ireland to 9 May, as 121 new cases and 6 new deaths were confirmed.
On 7 May, the Northern Ireland Executive met to discuss a roadmap to ending lockdown restrictions, with an announcement due during the week beginning 11
May.

On 18 May, the Northern Ireland Executive activated some aspects of step one with garden and recycling centres allowed to open.
However, on the same day, it was announced that further measures of step one would be activated on Tuesday 19 May such as groups of up to six people who do not share a household being able to meet outside and private church services being allowed.
On 15 June, the Executive announced more lockdown easing this time focusing on the hospitality industry with hotels, restaurants and bars that sell food or have a large beer garden being allowed to open from 3 July 2020.On
25 June it was announced that Northern Ireland would be reducing its 2-metre social distancing rule to 1 metre.
At the end of June, there were a total of 5,760 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Northern Ireland, with 551 deaths.
July saw a flood of relaxation of COVID-19 rules with betting shops, private clubs, restaurants, museums, and tourist sites opening on 3 July with salon and close contact services on 6 July.
10 July saw indoor gyms, outdoor playgrounds, weddings and baptisms, bingo and cinemas and competitive sports behind closed doors allowed.
Libraries and indoor leisure centres followed.
On 10 July the wearing of face coverings became compulsory on public transport in Northern Ireland, exceptions will be for those with a medical condition, children under the age of 13, and on school transport.
On 5 August it was announced that all pupils will return to school five days a week as normal at the start of term time in September.
Education Minister Peter Weir announced that years 1 to 10 will return to class in protected bubbles, with minimised movements between classes for years 11 to 14.On
20 August the Executive announced that some restrictions were to be reintroduced following rising cases in recent days.
Restrictions announced included reducing indoor gatherings from 10 to six people and outdoor meetings from 30 to 15.

On 10 September the Northern Ireland Executive imposed new restrictions on visiting homes for Ballymena, and parts of Glenavy, Lisburn and Crumlin, following a rise in COVID-19 cases in those areas.
From the following week, people living in those areas are limited to social gatherings of six and are encouraged not to travel outside the areas.
The Executive also announced further easing of restrictions nationally in Northern Ireland such as the reopening of wet bars on 21 September.
On 14 October the Northern Ireland Executive announced a new 'circuit breaker' lockdown effective from Friday 16 October for four weeks.
On 3 December, the Executive agreed to ease restrictions on 11 December.
Non-essential retail, close contract business, churches and gyms can reopen with social distancing and some limitations being observed.
Parts of the hospitality industry can reopen such as cafes, restaurants and bars that serve food can open but must be closed by 23:00, wet pubs must remain shut.
On 17 December, the Northern Ireland executive announced Northern Ireland would go into a lockdown from 26 December.
This involved the closure of all non-essential retail, hospitality.
The Christmas bubble system remained in place.
Due to the spread of a new variant of COVID-19 throughout Northern Ireland, the Executive hardened restrictions further on 5 January 2021.
From Friday 8 January a stay-at-home order became law meaning people can only leave home for medical or food needs, exercise, and work that cannot be done from home.
Further restrictions were also announced for schools with pupils from nursery, primary and post-primary schools carrying out remote learning until after the mid-term break in the middle of February 2021.

====
Scotland ====
"Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives" slogan rejected and "Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" was used.

On 20 March the Scottish Government told cafes, pubs, and restaurants to close.
On 6 April
the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020 which was introduced as an Emergency Bill in the Scottish Parliament on 31 March 2020 gained Royal Assent, becoming law.

On 16 April, after reviewing the lockdown with all nations in the UK, the decision was made to extend it for another 3 weeks until
7 May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her daily briefing said, ". . .
I want to stress that the news is positive . . .
Early indications are that the lockdown restrictions have resulted in a slowing down in the rate of community transmission of the virus.
"On 28 April
the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advised the voluntary use of (non-medical grade) cloth face masks to be used in enclosed spaces such as shops and public transport, but not generally in public, excluding those who are under two years old or who have respiratory illnesses such as asthma.

On 8 May First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reported that there was some recognition that each of the four nations of the UK might move at different speeds with regard to loosening the lockdown and that she would not be pressured into lifting restrictions prematurely.
On 11 May, in a national address to Scotland on the beginning of the seventh week of lockdown, Nicola Sturgeon asked the nation "to stick with lockdown for a bit longer - so that we can consolidate our progress, not jeopardise it[…] I won't risk unnecessary deaths by acting rashly or prematurely."

On 21 May First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlined a four-phase "route map" for easing lockdown restrictions in Scotland that included allowing people to meet up outside with people from one other household in the first phase.
The lockdown would be eased from 28 May subject to the number of new cases of COVID-19 continuing to fall.
Schools in Scotland would reopen on 11 August, when students would receive a "blended model" of part-time study at school combined with some learning at home.
On 28 May the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced an easing of the lockdown in Scotland from the following day, with people able to meet friends and family outside in groups of no more than eight but keeping two metres apart.
On 19 June, some easing of lockdown restrictions with meeting outdoors of up to 8 people from two other households whilst maintaining social distancing, for single people or singles with children they may meet with another household indoors without social distancing.
Face coverings mandatory on public transport.
Exercise within 5 miles of home.
On 29 June further easing of lockdown with indoor workplaces allowed to open, street access retail and outdoor markets opening, outdoor sports playgrounds, zoos and parks open, outdoor marriages allowed and people can move house.
All with social distancing.
On 3 July the 5 mile travel ban is lifted, self contained holiday accommodation allowed to re-open for business, visits to care homes by one "key visitor" were permitted but meetings had to be outdoors and a 2m distance maintained, young people under 12 were not required to social distance and 12-17 year olds
may meet in groups of up to 8 people
provided social distancing is maintained.
Beer gardens and outdoor cafes can open from 6 July.
It will be compulsory to wear face coverings in shops from 10 July.
On 10 July Air Bridge system starts which did not require self isolation for people returning from any of 57 countries, similar to, but less than the list of Air Bridges from England and Wales.
Up to 15 people from five different households may meet outdoors whilst
maintaining 2m social distancing, up to 8 people from three households may meet indoors and people from outside a household may stay overnight.
On 11 August pupils returned to schools.
They did not need to socially distance but teachers had to wear masks if they were in close proximity with others and socially distance from each other.
By 31 August, pupils at high schools are obliged to wear face masks in corridors, canteens and other communal areas.
On 22 September First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announces nationwide restrictions which go into effect on Friday 25 September, these restrictions affect the pub closing times to meetings within households.

On 2 November a new, 5 level, or "tier" system is introduced into Scotland - bringing new, targeted restrictions to different regions of the country.

====
England ====
The April lockdown left a significant impact on the economy, resulting in shrinking it by a fifth, i.e. 20%.
The "circuit-breaker" lockdown, which is expected to be relatively less intense could hit the economy by 5% or more.
As per Capital Economics, the estimated time required for the economy to get back to the pre-pandemic levels is a year to 2023.The slogan changed to "Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives" and those who could not work from home, including specifically construction and manufacturing workers, were encouraged to return to work albeit avoiding the use of public transport.
Additionally, the once-a-day limit on exercise was lifted.
The COVID-19 threat level system was introduced, and the "Stay Home" phase was announced to be equivalent to Level 4 (where 1 meant "COVID-19 is not known to be present in the UK", and 5 meant "The circulation of COVID-19 is high and rising exponentially
and there is a material risk of healthcare being overwhelmed").

On 13 May,  those in England were allowed to meet one other person not from their household outside whilst maintaining a 2-metre social distance, and from 28 May groups of up to six from different households were allowed to meet outside, keeping a safe distance.

From 1 June, English primary schools were encouraged to re-open to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, and
extremely vulnerable people shielding at home were advised it was safe to go outside for once-daily, socially-distanced exercise, for the first time in approximately two months.

From 15 June, non-essential retail reopened, and English secondary schools were asked to prepare to provide Year 10 and Year 12 students with some face-to-face meetings to support their home learning for essential upcoming exams the next year.
It also became mandatory to wear face coverings in healthcare settings and on public transport.

From 4 July, most other businesses were allowed to reopen, except for those considered to pose the highest risk such as indoor gyms, and social gathering rules were relaxed further.
Most notably, the two-meter rule was relaxed to one meter apart, where other mitigations such as face coverings were being used.
The only legal measure that remained, except for face coverings on public transport and in healthcare, was an upper legal limit of 30 on gatherings (except in 'local lockdown' areas, see below), but people were advised to limit gatherings to either two households in any indoor or outdoor, public or private setting, or to a maximum of six, outdoors only, when people gathering were from more than two households.

From 24 July, it became mandatory in England to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets.
By 15 August, most other businesses, including indoor theatres, casinos and bowling alleys, had been allowed to reopen.
Nightclubs and sexual entertainment venues, however, remained closed.

Schools reopened full-time from September, and from 9 September, the slogan changed once more, to "Hands, Face, Space" reminding the public to wash or sanitize hands often, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and keep a space of one meter or more from others, as well as letting fresh air in at public spaces
On 16 October, Northern Ireland commenced a partial lockdown.
Starting on 17 October, the government announced that London, among other areas, would move to Tier 2 restrictions, following a spike in cases, banning people from mixing indoors
privately.7  days after the lockdown in Wales, on 31 October, it was announced that a partial lockdown would commence in England from 5 November 2020, to last for 4 weeks up to and including 2 December.
Through the month of November, mass asymptomatic testing brought the case rate in Liverpool down enough for it to move down from Tier 3 into Tier 2.

After that, a new tiered approach was put into place, to be reviewed on 16 December (with any changes coming into force three days later).
For 5 days over the Christmas period (23–27 December), these restrictions are to be relaxed, allowing for three households to meet and form a protective "bubble" during this time period.
However this was not the case for residents in and around London as a fourth tier was introduced to combat rising cases.

On 4 January 2021, all four Chief Medical Officers and the NHS England Medical Director recommended that the COVID Alert Level should be increased, from level 4 to level 5, indicating that there was a material risk of healthcare services becoming overwhelmed.
On that day, Nicola Sturgeon announced a lockdown in Scotland which took effect at midnight.
Later that day, Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown in England, which took legal effect at 00:01 on 5 January.
On 22 February 2021, the UK Government published its 4-step plan to ease lockdown restrictions in England.
The first step of the plan, which, amongst other easements, provides for school re-openings, took effect on 8 March.

===
United States ===
Stay-at-home orders in the United States have come from several states and a large number of local jurisdictions, sometimes leading to conflicts between different levels of government and a patchwork of inconsistent dates and rules.
On 15 March 2020, Puerto Rico governor Wanda Vázquez Garced signed an executive order to order all citizens to stay home starting at 9 p.m. with exceptions in limited circumstances between 5 a.m. and 9 pm.
Governmental operations and non-essential businesses were to be closed until 30 March.
The first order within the states was simultaneously imposed by health authorities in heart of the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties and the cities of San Francisco and Berkeley)
effective 17 March 2020, affecting nearly 6.7 million people.
Other cities and counties across the state followed suit over the next two days, until Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, issued a state-wide order effective 19 March 2020.On 20 March 2020, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state-wide stay-at-home order with a mandate that 100% of non-essential workforce to be conducted as working from home
effective 22 March.
Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker followed that lead on the same day with a state-wide order which would go into effect on 21 March at 5 pm.
Ned Lamont, the governor of Connecticut, signed an executive order called "Stay Safe, Stay At Home" to take effect state-wide on 23 March at 8 p.m.
On 20 March 2020, Navajo Nation announced that it had broadened the stay-at-home order to cover the entire reservation, the largest in the country.
On 21 March 2020, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy announced a state-wide stay-at-home order effective at 9 p.m. on the same day.
On 22 March 2020, Ohio governor Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton issued a state-wide stay-at-home order effective 23 March.
In the afternoon, the Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards announced a state-wide stay-at-home order in a press conference.
Delaware governor John Carney followed suit with a stay-at-home order for his state.

On 23 March 2020, several state governors announced their state-wide stay-at-home order:
Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker ordered non-essential businesses to close in-person operations effective 24 March until 7 April and directed the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to issue a stay-at-home advisory.

Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer announced her state-wide executive order to stay-at-home at 11:00 am for all non-essential businesses effective 24 March until 28 May.
Indiana governor Eric Holcomb announced state-wide stay-at-home order effective 25 March until 7 April.

West Virginia governor Jim Justice ordered non-essential businesses to be closed immediately, and stay-at-home order effective at 8 pm.

After growing calls from local officials on Sunday, Oregon governor Kate Brown issued a stay-at-home order on Monday effective immediately with class C misdemeanor charges for violators.

New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a state-wide stay-at-home order that requires 100% of non-essential business workforce to work from home effective 24 March until 10 April.

Washington governor Jay Inslee signed a state-wide stay-at-home proclamation and ordered to close non-essential businesses effective 25 March for two weeks.

Hawaii governor David Ige issued a state-wide stay-at-home order effective 25 March which was similar to the orders that were previously issued for Maui and Honolulu counties.
On 23 March 2020, Yakama Nation announced its "Stay Home, Stay Healthy" order.

It overrules any local stay-at-home restrictions previously in place, and instructs residents to stay at home unless they're conducting "essential services," meaning either traveling to and from jobs or other exceptions, including buying groceries; purchasing medical equipment; going out to exercise; and visiting medical facilities.
The same day, Dr. Anthony Fauci publicly questioned why all states were not under stay-at-home orders.
In late May 2020, citywide curfews were enacted in San Francisco and several surrounding cities; San Jose; Minneapolis; Atlanta; Chicago; Cleveland; Columbus; Denver; Jacksonville, FL; Los Angeles; Memphis, TN; Omaha, Nebraska; Lincoln, Nebraska; Pittsburgh, Philadelphia; Portland; Salt Lake City; San Antonio; Buffalo, New York; Rochester, NY; Syracuse; New York City; Milwaukee; Seattle; Cincinnati; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fayetteville; Raleigh, North Carolina; Charleston, SC; Sacramento, CA; Columbia, SC; and Asheville, NC due to protests regarding the killing of George Floyd.
Countywide curfews were enacted for Los Angeles County, California and Alameda County, California as well.
Arizona enacted a state-wide curfew.
These curfews are imposed as complemented to stay-at-home order that imposed by state or local authorities.

On 2 November 2020, Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker issued a night-time stay-at-home advisory and business curfew effective 6 November 2020.

Countries and territories without lockdowns ==
Almost all countries and territories affected with COVID-19 have introduced and enforced some form of lockdown.
However, a few exceptions include South Korea and Taiwan, which rapidly and consistently implemented highly organized mass testing, contact tracing, public messaging and selective quarantining to identify and isolate outbreaks.
Korea's K-Quarantine system has been highly effective at bringing the pandemic under control.
Another exception in Asia is Japan.
Authorities in Tokyo have advised businesses to close and for the population to stay at home, but do not have legal authority to enforce a lockdown or penalise non-compliance.
Compliance with advice has nevertheless been high.
In the European Union, the sole nation not following this strategy is Sweden.
Measures in Sweden included the closing of universities and high schools and asking older and at-risk residents to avoid social contact, while keeping restaurants, primary schools and kindergartens open.
However, in early 2021 new laws permitting lockdown were enacted and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven warned that a lockdown was being considered.
Some of the few countries that did not enact lockdowns during 2020 were forced to later in the pandemic.
In Malawi, a proposed lockdown by the government was delayed by the High Court throughout 2020, until a state of emergency was declared and the country entered a lockdown in January 2021 in response to a worsening outbreak.
Although Cambodia restricted movement within the country during a period in 2020, it introduced its first major restrictions, including a curfew and later stay-at-home order across capital city Phnom Penh, during its largest outbreak to date in early 2021.
East Timor also enacted its first lockdown of capital city Dili in March 2021.In
the United States and Brazil, a handful of states have not introduced any lockdown-type measures (commonly known as "stay-at-home orders").

====
Total confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries ====
On 8 April 2020, the Robert Koch Institute began using another method to estimate the numbers of recoveries, now also incorporating cases where the date of the first symptoms is unknown.
This caused the singular sharp drop in active cases on that date.

====
New cases per day ====


====
Reproduction rate ====
The effective reproduction number or reproduction rate, symbolised with Re, is a rate of how many more people are infected from a positive COVID-19 case.
In order to suppress an outbreak, the reproduction rate must be constantly below 1, which means each positive case infects less than one person.
The Robert Koch Institute measures the reproduction rate as a moving 4-day average of the number of new symptomatic cases using a nowcasting according to the 4-day average number of new cases on a specific day and comparing it with the corresponding mean 4 days before, reflecting the spread of the disease roughly one to two weeks before any specific day.
As it is however prone to larger fluctuation, taking into account possible delays in reporting, a 7-day rate is then introduced, which compares the 7-day average of cases at one specific date with 4 days before.

Specific values have been published since its daily report on 7 April, while the R-rate has been calculated from 6 March.

Effective reproduction number.

Logarithmic scaling highlights the important changes near 1.

Above 1, the number of active infections will grow exponentially , but even below 1 the decline will be very slow, if Re is too close to 1.
====
Number of tests per week ====
Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 11/2021 (Mar 15–21), 48,979,281 laboratory tests in at least 212 laboratories have been recorded, 2,955,672 of which have been positive.
The number of tests is not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients.

====
Testing ====
Until late March, due to the restrictive Robert Koch Institute (RKI) testing criteria, Germans without specific symptoms could not be tested.
On 25 March 2020, the RKI announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be tested.
In the revised criteria, acute respiratory symptoms were generally maintained, with one additional criterion of the following having to be fulfilled: contact to a confirmed positive case in the last 14 days; work in health care; membership in a risk group; and in case of serious illness, no differential diagnosis.
RKI president Wieler said that tests should be conducted in a "targeted and strategically sensible" manner, in order to avoid overstraining testing capacities.
Mildly ill patients would not always be able to get tested, in which case they would be asked to remain at home and minimise contact with others.
Wieler announced that the taking of representative samples in order to assess the number of infected more reliably would commence soon.
Calls for conducting such studies were raised concurrently.

====
Reporting lag ====
Incubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of five to ten days.
Because of the federal health care system in Germany, states vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public.
Local (Landkreise / Kreisfreie Städte)
health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the nations federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.
Reporting switched from manual to electronic.
The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days.
Cases reported by state health departments are added earlier to a project by Funke Mediengruppe, to which Berliner Morgenpost belongs.
Johns Hopkins University seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.
As of 25 March, the number of unknown cases was thought to be up to tenfold higher.
Statistician Katharina Schüller advocated for representative sampling to gauge the real number of infected people, an initiative supported by the president of German Medical Association and scientists of Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

====
Number of deaths ====
As of March 2020, the reported death rate calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of infected in Germany was lower than in some other areas such as Italy, for example.
This has led foreign media to applaud or question it, while virologists, among others the leader of the RKI, warned that the country was simply at an earlier stage of the outbreak and fatalities would soon increase.
Possible explanations have included:
Germany tested more extensively, which decreased the uncertainty about the proportion of asymptomatic infected and brought the calculated mortality rate closer to the actual (lower) mortality rate.
The extensive testing found younger and less sick people more often: their median age was given as 47 or 45 years, whereas Italy tested older and sicker people at a median of 63 years.
Many early infections happened in skiers returning from Tyrol, who tended to be fit people rather than persons at higher risk of complications, and contributed a negligible mortality.

Since Germany has no routine for post-mortem tests, unlike Italy it may not have discovered all deaths.
In Spain, the first death was also discovered by a test carried out post-mortem.

The elderly in Germany often do not live in the same household as their extended family and this has reduced the number of infections.

Germany has many test laboratories and a weekly test capacity of 160 thousand and could have a lower number of unrecorded cases of infections than for example Italy, though the number of tests including negative results was unknown until 23 March.

Italy has several times fewer hospital beds for intensive respiratory care than Germany.
While Italy and Spain ran out of beds, German hospitals still had free capacity.
The number of beds, protective gear and the number of medical personnel can become bottlenecks for providing adequate care.
However, as of the end of March, it was "too early to say whether Germany is better medically prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic than other countries".

Daily reported death tolls increased in the first half of April; the Robert-Koch-Institut attributed this to the fact that there was a growing number of outbreaks in care homes, whose elderly populations were particularly vulnerable.

====
Criticism ====
On 7 May 2020, Stephan Kohn, Oberregierungsrat ("senior government official") in the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, published a document based on a large number of statistical surveys in which he harshly criticised the government's assessment of and reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a member of the Ministry's Division KM 4 Critical Infrastructure Protection, Kohn devised the document with the help of external professors (Harald Walach, Gunnar Heinsohn, Stefan Hockertz, Andreas Sönnichsen, Sucharit Bhakdi, Karina Reiß, Peter Schirmacher).
Kohn accused his own government of being one of the largest distributors of "fake news" concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.
After the publication Kohn was disavowed by Angela Merkel and Horst Seehofer, who said that he was neither ordered nor authorized to do so, and by his own party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany.
He was suspended and his laptop confiscated.
He is accused of giving away internal information and disciplinary proceedings have been initiated.
The counseling professors and physicians issued a statement in which they back Stephan Kohn.

The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, codenamed AZD1222, and sold under the brand names Covishield and Vaxzevria among others, is a viral vector vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

Developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, it is given by intramuscular injection, using as a vector the modified chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1.
The efficacy of the vaccine is 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 beginning at 22 days following the first dose and 81.3% after the second dose.
The vaccine has a good safety profile, with side effects including injection-site pain, headache, and nausea, all generally resolving within a few days.
More rarely, anaphylaxis may occur (the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has 268 reports out of some 21.2 million vaccinations as of 14 April 2021).
In very rare cases (less than 1 in 10,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots in combination with low levels of blood platelets.
According to the European Medicines Agency as of 4 April 2021, 222 cases of blood clots have been reported from the European Economic Area and the UK, where around 34 million people have received the vaccine.
On 30 December 2020, the vaccine was first approved for use in the UK vaccination programme, and the first vaccination outside of a trial was administered on 4 January 2021.
The vaccine has since been approved by several medicine agencies worldwide, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, and was approved for an Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Some countries have limited its use to elderly people at higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to concerns over the very rare side effects of the vaccine in younger individuals.

==
Medical uses ==
The Oxford–
AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine is used to provide protection against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to prevent COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older.

The medicine is administered by two 0.5 ml doses injected intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle (upper arm) four to twelve weeks apart, with the WHO recommending the second is given 8 to 12 weeks after the first for optimum efficacy.
===
Efficacy ===
An analysis published on 19 February 2021 showed an efficacy of 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 beginning at 22 days following the first dose, increasing to 81.3% when the second dose is given 12 weeks or more after the first.

==
Adverse effects ==
The most common side effects in the clinical trials were usually mild or moderate and got better within a few days after vaccination.
Vomiting, diarrhoea, swelling, redness at the injection site and low levels of blood platelets occurred in less than 1 in 10 people.
Enlarged lymph nodes, decreased appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, abdominal pain, itching and rash occurred in less than 1 in 100 people.
In very rare cases (less than 1 in 10,000 people) the vaccine can lead to blood clots in combination with low levels of blood platelets.
The UK MHRA as of 14 April 2021 report an overall case incidence of thromboembolic events with concurrent low platelets of 7.9 per million doses (less than 1 in 100,000 people).As with other vaccines, anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are a known side effect of ADZ1222 that should be given under close supervision.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has assessed 41 cases of anaphylaxis from around 5 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom.

==
Pharmacology ==
The Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector, containing the full‐length codon‐optimised coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein along with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence.
The adenovirus is called replication-deficient because some of its essential genes were deleted and replaced by a gene coding for the spike protein.
Following vaccination, the adenovirus vector enters the cells and releases its genes, which are transported to the cell nucleus; thereafter the cell's machinery does the transcription into mRNA and the translation into proteins.
The protein of interest is the spike protein, an external protein that enables the SARS-type coronavirus to enter cells through the enzymatic domain of ACE2.
Producing it following vaccination will prompt the immune system to attack the coronavirus through antibodies and T-cells if it later infects the body.

==
Manufacturing ==
The vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures and costs around US$3 to US$4 per dose.
On 17 December 2020, a tweet by the Belgian Budget State Secretary revealed that the European Union (EU) would pay €1.78 (US$2.16) per dose, The New York Times suggesting the lower price might relate to factors including investment in vaccine production infrastructure by the EU.As of March 2021 the vaccine active substance (ChAdOx1-SARS-COV-2) is being produced at several sites worldwide, with AstraZeneca claiming to have established 25 sites in 15 countries.

The UK sites are Oxford and Keele with bottling and finishing in Wrexham.

Other sites include the Serum Institute of India at Pune.

The Halix site at Leiden was approved by the EMA on 26 March 2021, joining three other sites approved by the EU.

===
Branding ===
The vaccine is marketed under the brand name Covishield by the Serum Institute of India.

The name of the vaccine was changed to Vaxzevria in the European Union on 25 March 2021.
Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca COVID‐19 Vaccine, and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca are manufactured by AstraZeneca.
===
Supply timeline ===
Agreements for access to vaccines began being signed in May 2020, with the UK having priority for the first 100 million doses if trials proved successful, with the final agreement being signed at the end of August.
On 21 May 2020, AstraZeneca agreed to provide 300 million doses to the US for US$1.2 billion, implying a cost of US$4 per dose.
An AstraZeneca spokesman said the funding also covers development and clinical testing.
It also reached a technology transfer agreement with the Mexican and Argentinean governments and agreed to produce at least 400 million doses to be distributed throughout Latin America.
The active ingredients would be produced in Argentina and sent to Mexico to be completed for distribution.
In June 2020, Emergent BioSolutions signed a US$87 million deal to manufacture doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine specifically for the US market.
The deal was part of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed initiative to develop and rapidly scale production of targeted vaccines before the end of 2020.
Catalent would be responsible for the finishing and packaging process.
On 4 June 2020, the WHO's COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) facility made initial purchases of 300 million doses from the company for low-
to middle-income countries.
Also, AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India reached a licensing agreement to independently supply 1 billion doses of the Oxford University vaccine to middle- and low-income countries, including India.
Later in September, funded by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the COVAX program secured an additional 100  million doses at US$3 per dose.
On 27 August 2020, AstraZeneca concluded an agreement with the EU, to supply up to 400 million doses to all EU and select European Economic Area (EEA) member states.
The European Commission took over negotiations started by the Inclusive Vaccines Alliance, a group made up of France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, in June 2020.On 5 November 2020, a tripartite agreement was signed between the government of Bangladesh, the Serum Institute of India, and Beximco Pharma of Bangladesh.
Under the agreement Bangladesh ordered 30 million doses of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine from Serum through Beximco for $4 per shot.
On the other hand, Indian government has given 3.2 million doses to Bangladesh as a gift which were also produced by Serum.
But Serum supplied only 7 million doses from the tripartite agreement in the first two months of the year.
Bangladesh was supposed to receive 5 million doses per month  but not received shipments in March and April.
As a result, rollout of vaccine  has been disrupted by supply shortfalls.
Most people who have received the first dose are not getting the second dose on time.
Not getting the second dose at the right time is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the vaccination program.
In addition, several citizens of Bangladesh have expressed doubts about its effectiveness and  safety.
Bangladesh is looking for alternative vaccine sources because India isn't supplying the vaccine according to the timeline of the deal.
Thailand's agreement in November 2020 for 26 million doses of vaccine would cover 13 million people, approximately 20% of the population, with the first lot expected to be delivered at the end of May.
The public health minister indicated the price paid was $5 per dose; AstraZeneca (Thailand) explained in January 2021 after a controversy that the price each country paid depended on production cost and differences in supply chain, including manufacturing capacity, labour and raw material costs.
In January 2021, the Thai cabinet approved further talks on ordering another 35 million doses, and the Thai FDA approved the vaccine for emergency use for 1 year.
Siam Bioscience, a company owned by Vajiralongkorn, will receive technological transfer and has the capacity to manufacture up to 200 million doses a year for export to ASEAN.Also in November, the Philippines agreed to buy 2.6 million doses, reportedly worth around ₱700 million (approximately US$5.60 per dose).
In December 2020, South Korea signed a contract with AstraZeneca to secure 20 million doses of its vaccine, reportedly equivalent in worth to those signed by Thailand and the Philippines, with the first shipment expected as early as January 2021.
As of January 2021, the vaccine remains under review by the South Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.
AstraZeneca signed a deal with South Korea's SK Bioscience to manufacture its vaccine products.
The collaboration calls for the SK affiliate to manufacture AZD1222 for local and global markets.
On 7 January 2021, the South African government announced that they had secured an initial 1 million doses from the Serum Institute of India, to be followed by another 500,000 doses in February, however the South African government subsequently cancelled the use of the vaccine, selling its supply to other African countries, and switched its vaccination program to use the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
On 22 January 2021, AstraZeneca announced that in the event the European Union approved the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, initial supplies would be lower than expected due to production issues at Novasep in Belgium.
Only 31 million of the previously predicted 80 million doses would be delivered to the EU by March 2021.
In an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot said the delivery schedule for the doses in the EU was two months behind schedule.
He mentioned low yield from cell cultures at one large-scale European site.
Analysis published in The Guardian also identified an apparently low yield from bioreactors in the Belgium plant and noted the difficulties in setting up this form of process, with variable yields often occurring.
As a result, the EU imposed export controls on vaccine doses; controversy erupted as to whether doses were being diverted to the UK and whether deliveries to Northern Ireland would be disrupted.
On 24 February 2021, a shipment of the vaccine to Accra, Ghana, via COVAX made it the first country in Africa to receive vaccines via the initiative.

==
History ==
The vaccine arose from a collaboration between Oxford University's Jenner Institute and Vaccitech, a private company spun off from the University, with financing from Oxford Sciences Innovation, Google Ventures, and Sequoia Capital, among others.
The first batch of the COVID-19 vaccine produced for clinical testing was developed by Oxford University's Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group in collaboration with Italian manufacturer Advent Srl located in Pomezia.
The team is led by Sarah Gilbert, Adrian Hill, Andrew Pollard, Teresa Lambe, Sandy Douglas and Catherine Green.
===
Early development ===
In February 2020, the Jenner Institute agreed a collaboration with the Italian company Advent Srl for the production of a batch of 1,000 doses of a vaccine candidate for clinical trials.
Originally, Oxford intended to donate the rights to manufacture and market the vaccine to any drugmaker who wanted to do so, but after the Gates Foundation urged Oxford to find a large company partner to get its COVID-19 vaccine to market, the university backed off of this offer in May 2020.
The UK government then encouraged Oxford to work with AstraZeneca, a company based in Europe, instead of Merck & Co., a US-based company.
Government ministers also had concerns that a vaccine manufactured in the US would not be available in the UK, according to anonymous sources in The Wall Street Journal.
Financial considerations at Oxford and spin-out companies may have also played a part in the decision to partner with AstraZeneca.
An initially not-for-profit licencing agreement was signed between the University and AstraZeneca PLC, in May 2020, with 1 billion doses of potential supply secured, with the UK reserving access to the initial 100 million doses.
Furthermore, the US reserved 300 million doses, as well as the authority to perform Phase III trials in the US.
The collaboration was also granted GB£68m of UK government funding, and US$1.2bn of US government funding, to support the development of the vaccine.
In June 2020, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) confirmed that the third phase of trials for the vaccine would begin in July 2020.
On 4 June, AstraZeneca announced that the COVAX program for equitable vaccine access managed by the WHO and financed by CEPI and Gavi had spent $750m to secure 300 million doses of the vaccine to be distributed to low-income or under-developed countries.

===
Clinical trials ===
In July 2020, AstraZeneca partnered with IQVIA to accelerate the timeframe for clinical trials being planned or conducted in the US.
On 31 August, AstraZeneca announced that it had begun enrollment of adults for a US-funded, 30,000-subject late-stage study.
Clinical trials for the vaccine candidate were halted worldwide on 8 September, as AstraZeneca investigated a possible adverse reaction which occurred in a trial participant in the UK.
Trials were resumed on 13 September after AstraZeneca and Oxford, along with UK regulators, concluded it was safe to do so.
AstraZeneca was later criticised for refusing to provide details about potentially serious neurological side effects in two trial participants who had received the experimental vaccine in the UK.
While the trials resumed in the UK, Brazil, South Africa, Japan and India, the US did not resume clinical trials of the vaccine until 23 October.
This was due to a separate investigation by the Food and Drug Administration surrounding a patient illness that triggered a clinical hold, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar.

====
Results of Phase III trial ====
On 23 November 2020, the first interim data was released by Oxford University and AstraZeneca from the vaccine's ongoing Phase III trials.
The interim data reported a 70% efficacy, based on combined results of 62% and 90% from different groups of participants who were given different dosages.
The decision to combine results from two different dosages was met with criticism from some who questioned why the results were being combined.
AstraZeneca responded to the criticism by agreeing to carry out a new multi-country trial using the lower dose, which had led to the 90% claim.
The full publication of the interim results from four ongoing Phase III trials on 8 December allowed regulators and scientists to begin evaluating the vaccine's efficacy.
The December report showed that at 21 days after the second dose and beyond, there were no hospitalisations or severe disease in those who received the vaccine, compared to 10 cases in the control groups.
The rate of serious adverse events was balanced between the active and control groups, which suggested that the active vaccine did not pose safety concerns beyond a rate experienced in the general population.
One case of transverse myelitis was reported 14 days after the second-dose was administered as being possibly related to vaccination, with an independent neurological committee considering the most likely diagnosis to be of an idiopathic, short-segment, spinal cord demyelination.
The other two cases of transverse myelitis, one in the vaccine group and the other in the control group, were considered to be unrelated to vaccination.
A subsequent analysis, published on 19 February 2021, showed an efficacy of 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 beginning at 22 days following the first dose, increasing to 81.3% when the second dose is given 12 weeks or more after the first.
However, the results did not show any protection against asymptomatic COVID-19 following only one dose.
Beginning 14 days following timely administration of a second dose, the trial results showed 66.7% efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection, and the UK arm (which evaluated asymptomatic infections in participants) was inconclusive as to the prevention of asymptomatic infection.
Efficacy was higher at greater intervals between doses, peaking at around 80% when the second dose was given at 12 weeks or longer after the first.
On 22 March 2021, AstraZeneca released interim results from the phase III trial conducted in the US that showed efficacy of 79% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation.
The next day, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) published a statement countering that those results may have relied on "outdated information" that may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.
AstraZeneca later revised its efficacy claim to be 76% after further review of the data.

====
Study on single dose effectivess ====
A study on the effectiveness of a first dose of the Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19 related hospitalisation in Scotland was based on a national prospective cohort study of 5.4 million people.
Between 8 December 2020 and 15 February 2021, 1,137,775 participants were vaccinated in the study, 490,000 of whom were given the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine.
The first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 94% for COVID-19-related hospitalisation at 28–34 days post-vaccination.
Combined results (all vaccinated participants, whether Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–AstraZeneca) showed a significant vaccine effect for prevention of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, which was comparable when restricting the analysis to those aged ≥80 years (81%).
The majority of the participants over the age of 65 were given the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine.

===
Approvals ===
The first country to issue a temporary or emergency approval for the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was the UK.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) began a review of efficacy and safety data on 27 November 2020, followed by approval for use on 30 December 2020, becoming the second vaccine approved for use in the national vaccination programme.
The BBC reported that the first person to receive the vaccine outside of clinical trials was vaccinated on 4 January 2021.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) began review of the vaccine on 12 January 2021, and stated in a press release that a recommendation could be issued by the agency by 29 January, followed by the European Commission deciding on a conditional marketing authorisation within days.
On 29 January 2021, the EMA recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for AZD1222 for people 18 years of age and older, and the recommendation was accepted by the European Commission the same day.
Prior to approval across the EU, the Hungarian regulator unilaterally approved the vaccine instead of waiting for EMA approval.
On 30 January 2021, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health approved the AstraZeneca vaccine for use, becoming the first vaccine to be approved in Vietnam.
The vaccine has since been approved by a number of non-EU countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan regulatory authorities for emergency usage in their respective countries.

South Korea granted approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 10 February 2021, thus becoming the first vaccine to be approved for use in that country.
The regulator recommended the two-shot regimen be used in all adults, including the elderly, noting that consideration is needed when administering the vaccine to individuals over 65 years of age due to limited data from that demographic in clinical trials.
On the same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued interim guidance and recommended the AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts also having considered use where variants were present and concluded there was no need not to recommend it.
Later in February, the government and regulatory authorities in Australia (16 February 2021) and Canada (26 February 2021) granted approval for temporary use of the vaccine.

===
Suspensions ===


====
South Africa ====
On 7 February 2021, the vaccine rollout in South Africa was suspended.
Researchers from the University of the Witwatersrand released interim, non-peer-reviewed data that suggested the AstraZeneca vaccine provided minimal protection against mild or moderate disease infection among young people.
The BBC reported on 8 February 2021 that Katherine O'Brien, director of immunisation at the WHO, felt it was "really plausible" the AstraZeneca vaccine could have a "meaningful impact" on the South African variant, particularly in preventing serious illness and death.
The same report also indicated the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam said the Witwatersrand study did not change his opinion that the AstraZeneca vaccine was "rather likely" to have an effect on severe disease from the South African variant.
The South African government subsequently cancelled the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

====
Europe ====
On 3 March 2021, Austria suspended the use of one batch of vaccine after two persons suffered blood clots after vaccination, one of whom died.
In total, four cases of blood clots have been identified in the same batch of 1 million doses.
Although no causal link with vaccination has been shown, several other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia also halted the vaccine rollout over the following days while waiting for the EMA to finish a safety review triggered by the cases.

In April 2021, the EMA concluded its safety review and concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects while reaffirming the overall benefits of the vaccine.
Following this announcement EU countries have resumed use of the vaccine with some limiting its use to elderly people at higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness.
On 30 March 2021, the German Ministry of Health announced that the use of the vaccine in people aged 60 and below should be the result of a recipient-specific discussion, and that younger patients could still be given the AstraZeneca vaccine, but only "at the discretion of doctors, and after individual risk analysis and thorough
explanation".
On 14 April, the Danish Health Authority indefinitely suspended use of the vaccine.
The Danish Health Authority said that it had other vaccines available and that the epidemic there was currently under control.
The decision was also based on the fact that the country has a high rate of vaccination and that it will now vaccinate only target groups that are less likely to become severely ill from COVID-19.
====
Canada ====
On 29 March 2021, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that distribution of the vaccine be suspended for patients below the age of 55; NACI chairwoman Caroline Quach-Thanh stated that the risk of blood clots was higher in younger patients, and that NACI needed to "evolve" its recommendations as new data becomes available.
Most Canadian provinces subsequently announced that they would follow this guidance.
As of 20 April 2021 there had been three confirmed cases of blood clotting tied to the vaccine in Canada, out of over 700,000 doses administered in the country.
Beginning 18 April, amid a major third wave of the virus, several Canadian provinces announced that they would backtrack on the NACI recommendation and extend eligibility for the AstraZeneca vaccine to residents as young as 40 years old, including Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan.
Quebec also extended eligibility to residents 45 and older.
The NACI guidance is a recommendation which does not affect the formal approval of the vaccine by Health Canada for all adults over 18; it stated on 14 April that it had updated its warnings on the vaccine as part of an ongoing review, but that "the potential risk of these events is very rare, and the benefits of the vaccine in protecting against COVID-19 outweigh its potential risks.
"On 23 April, citing the current state of supplies for mRNA-based vaccines and new data, NACI issued a recommendation that the vaccine can be offered to patients as young as 30 years old if benefits outweigh the risks, and the patient "does not wish to wait for an mRNA vaccine".
====
Indonesia ====
In mid-March, Indonesia halted the rollout of the vaccine while awaiting more safety guidance from the World Health Organization.

====
Australia ====
On 8 April 2021, Australia revised it's recommendations for the rollout of the vaccine to people under the age of 50, recommending that the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine be used instead where people aged under 50 years have not already received a first dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
The AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine can still be used in adults aged under 50 years where the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks for that individual and the person has made an informed decision based on an understanding of the risks and benefits in consultation with a medical professional.
====
Malaysia ====
After initially approving the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Malaysian health authorities removed the vaccine from the country's mainstream vaccination programme due to public concerns about its safety.
The initial 268,600 initial doses will be redirected to Selangor and the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, which have seen a recent surge in cases.

===
Safety review ===
On 11 March 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that there is no indication that vaccination has been the cause of the observed clotting issues, which are not listed as side effects of the vaccine.
According to the EMA, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than that seen in the general population.
As of 11 March 2021, 30 cases of thromboembolic events had been reported among the almost 5 million people vaccinated in the European Economic Area.
The UK's MHRA also stated that after more than 11 million doses administered, it had not been confirmed that the reported blood clots were caused by the vaccine and that vaccinations would not be stopped.
On 12 March 2021 the WHO stated that a causal relationship had not been shown and that vaccinations should continue.
AstraZeneca confirmed on 14 March 2021 that after examining over 17 million people who have been vaccinated with the vaccine, no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots in any particular country was found.
The company reported that as of 8 March 2021, across the EU and UK, there have been 15 events of deep vein thrombosis and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those given the vaccine, which is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of that size.
On 15 March 2021, the German Paul-Ehrlich Institute (PEI) reported that out of 1.6 million vaccinations, seven cases of cerebral vein thrombosis in conjunction with a deficiency of blood platelets had occurred.
According to the PEI, the number of cases of cerebral vein thrombosis after vaccination was statistically significantly higher than the number that would occur in the general population during a similar time period.
These reports prompted the PEI to recommended a temporary suspension of vaccinations until the EMA has completed their review of the cases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement on 17 March, regarding the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine safety signals, and still considers the benefits of the vaccine to outweigh its potential risks, further recommending that vaccinations continue.
On 18 March, the EMA announced that out of the around 20 million people who had received the vaccine, general blood clotting rates were normal, but that it had identified seven cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and eighteen cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
A causal link with the vaccine was not proven, but the EMA said it would conduct further analysis and recommended informing people eligible for the vaccine of the fact that the possibility it may cause rare clotting problems has not been disproven.
The EMA confirmed that the vaccine's benefits still outweigh the risks.
On 25 March, the EMA released updated product information.
According to the EMA, 100,000 cases of blood clots occur naturally each month in the EU, and the risk of blood clots was not statistically higher in the vaccinated population.
The EMA noted that COVID-19 itself causes an increased risk of the development of blood clots, and as such the vaccine would lower the risk of the formation of blood clots even if the 15 cases' causal link were to be confirmed.
Italy resumed vaccinations after the EMA's statement, with most of the remaining European countries following suit and resuming their AstraZeneca inoculations shortly thereafter.
To reassure the public of the vaccine's safety, the British and French Prime Ministers, Boris Johnson and Jean Castex, had themselves vaccinated live before the media with it shortly after the restart of the AstraZeneca vaccination campaigns in the EU.On 13 April 2021, the EMA issued its direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) about the vaccine.

===
Further development ===


====
New variant efficacy ====
A study by researchers from the COVID-19 Genomics United Kingdom Consortium, the AMPHEUS Project, and the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Group indicated the vaccine showed reduced efficacy against the Lineage B.1.1.7 (also known as UK or Kent)
Covid-19 variant, while individuals infected symptomatically typically had shorter duration of symptoms and less viral load thereby reducing the risk of transmission.
After these variants began spreading, concern arose that the E484K mutation, present in the South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28) variants, could evade the protection given by the vaccine.
In February 2021, the collaboration was working to adapt the vaccine to target these variants, with the expectation that a modified vaccine would be available "in a few months" as a "booster" given to people who had already completed the two-dose series of the original vaccine.

==
Society and culture ==
The Oxford University and AstraZeneca collaboration was seen as having the potential as being a low-cost vaccine with no onerous storage requirements.
A series of events from AstraZeneca, including miscommunication, supply difficulties, reports of adverse effects, national rollout suspensions, and politics including the high-profile European Commission–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine dispute, have been a public relations disaster, and in the opinion of one academic has led to increased vaccine hesitancy.
The vaccine remains a key component of the WHO backed COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) program, with the WHO, the EMA, and the MHRA continuing to state that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any possible side effects.

===
Economics ===
In early 2021, the Bureau for Investigative Journalism found that South Africa had paid double the rate for the European Commission, while Uganda paid triple.

==
Research ==
As of February 2021, the AZD1222 development team is working on adapting the vaccine to be more effective in relation to newer COVID-19 variants; redesigning the vaccine being the relatively quick process of switching the genetic sequence of the spike protein.
Manufacturing set-up and a small scale trial also being required before the adapted vaccine might be available in autumn.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive.

In early April 2020, the Government of Canada released modelling anticipating between 11,000–22,000 deaths over the course of the pandemic, assuming "stronger epidemic control".
Most cases over the course of the pandemic have been in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta.
Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada's provinces and territories.
Until March 2020, all cases had been linked to travel to a country with a substantial number of cases.
The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5.
In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada's provinces and territories declared states of emergency.
Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry.
Canada severely restricted its border access, barring travellers from all countries with some exceptions.
The federal Minister of Health invoked the Quarantine Act,
introduced following the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
The act has been used for the first time in its legislative history, legally requiring all travellers (excluding essential workers) returning to the country to self-isolate for 14 days.

By mid to late summer of 2020, the country saw a steady decline in active cases until, beginning late summer and through autumn, the country saw a resurgence of cases in all provinces and territories.
Prime Minister Trudeau declared on September 23, 2020 that Canada was experiencing a second wave of the virus.
New restrictions and reactions from provincial governments were put in place once again as cases increased, including variations of regional lockdowns.
In late November there was a disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble, a travel-restricted area of the country (formed of the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador) which had been established in July 2020.
The federal government passed legislation to approve further modified economic aid for businesses and individuals.
Nation-wide cases, hospitalizations and deaths spiked preceding and following the Christmas and holiday season in December 2020 and January 2021.
Alarmed by hospital capacity issues, fatalities and new cases, heavy restrictions (such as lockdowns and curfews) were put in place in affected areas (primarily Ontario, Quebec and Alberta) and across the country, which has resulted in active cases beginning to steadily decline, reaching a plateau in active cases in mid-February 2021.
During a third wave of the virus, cases began rising across most provinces west of Atlantic Canada in mid-March, prompting further lockdowns and restrictions in the most populous provinces like Ontario and Quebec.
Due to a relatively low volume of cases in the Atlantic provinces had plans to reopen the special travel restricted area known as the Atlantic Bubble, however in late April the third wave had spread to the provinces as well.
In response Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia reinstated travel bans toward the rest of the country.

Following Health Canada's approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and later the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna, mass vaccinations began nation-wide December 14, 2020.
On February 26, 2021 Health Canada approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccine for use and on March 5, 2021 additionally approved the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for a total of four approved vaccines in the nation.

==
Background and epidemiology ==
On January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

==
Preparations ==
On January 1, 2020, the WHO set up the IMST
(Incident Management Support Team) across all three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level,
putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.
On January 7, when it appeared that there was a health crisis emerging in Wuhan, Public Health Canada advised travellers to China to avoid contact with animals, noting that they were very carefully monitoring the situation
but there wasn't evidence of what caused the illness, or how it's spread.
On January 14, a person in Thailand was the first patient outside of China who was confirmed to have COVID-19.On January 15, the federal government activated its Emergency Operations Centre.
On January 17, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) indicated plans were in progress "to implement signage" in the Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver airports to raise awareness of the virus, and that there would be an additional health screening question added to the electronic kiosks for passengers arriving from central China.
The agency noted the overall risk to Canadians was low and there were no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada.
The CBSA said it would not be, at that time, implementing extra screening measures, but would "monitor the situation
closely".
On January 23, the federal Minister of Health, Patty Hajdu, said that five or six people were being monitored for signs of the virus.
That same day, Dr. Theresa Tam was a member of the WHO committee that broadcast that it was too early to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
The following day, in Wuhan, China, construction began on a new hospital to treat COVID-19 patients.
The hospital took only 10 days to build and was widely reported around the world.

Public health ====
The federal government activated its Emergency Operations Centre on January 15.
The federal government's pandemic response is based on two primary documents: the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness planning guidelines, which outlines risks and measures to address a viral disease, and the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events, which includes identifying, tracking, and ensuring rapid access to medical care.
As of February 27, the response plan was at level 3 (escalated).On March 18, the federal Minister of Health, Patty Hajdu, announced that the federal government had signed an interim order to speed up access to COVID-19 test kits that would allow provincial labs to increase testing.
The test kits are made by Switzerland-based Roche Molecular Systems and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
According to Health Canada, "an Interim Order is one of the fastest mechanisms available to the Government of Canada to help make health products available to address larger scale public health emergencies.
This Interim Order provides the Minister with the flexibility to consider the urgent circumstances relating to the need for the medical device, authorizations granted by foreign regulatory authorities, or possible new uses for medical devices that are approved in Canada."

On March 19, 2020, the federal government announced that it had added to Trudeau's March 11 announcement of $275 million in funding for an additional 49 projects to bring the total to 96 research projects that will focus on developing and implementing measures to detect, manage, and reduce the transmission of COVID-19.On March 20, as part of the announcement on Canada's industrial strategy (see below), Trudeau stated that the National Research Council will work with small- and medium-sized companies on health research to fight the virus.
On March 23, Theresa Tam began appearing in public service announcements on radio and television, urging personal hygiene, social distancing, and against unnecessary travel.
On April 6, Tam began to suggest that the use of non-medical face masks in public could be an "additional measure" to "protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain", but that this is not proven to protect the wearer, and is considered complementary to all existing health guidance issued thus far.
In response to backlogs in COVID-19 testing, especially provinces like Ontario, Health Canada approved new rapid testing for the virus.

====
Long-term care homes ====
Long-term care homes have been impacted heavily by the pandemic; on April 13, Tam reported that at least half of COVID-19 deaths in Canada had been linked to long-term care homes (with the exact number varying by province), and that "these deaths will continue to increase, even as the epidemic growth rate slows down.
Tam cited factors such as outside visitors, communal living spaces, and staff being transferred among multiple facilities, as particular vulnerabilities.
The pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing staffing issues at some facilities, including underpaid staff, and being understaffed in general.
On April 28, Tam stated that as many of 79 percent of Canada's COVID-19 fatalities occurred in long-term care homes.
Health Canada has issued recommendations for long-term care homes, encouraging them to restrict outside visitors and volunteers, restrict employees from being transferred between multiple facilities, provide personal protective equipment, enforce physical distancing during meals, screen staff and essential visitors, On April 15, Trudeau announced that the federal government planned to provide additional pay to long-term care workers.

In April 2020, the Department of National Defence gave the provinces the option to get Canadian Armed Forces assistance in combating the pandemic in long-term care facilities.
Quebec was the first to act, with military personnel arriving on 17 April.
Ontario acted next, with Premier Doug Ford requesting military aid on 22 April.

==== Travel and entry restrictions ====
On March 14, Canada recommended against any international travel, and advised those returning from outside of Canada, except for essential workers (such as flight crew), to self-isolate for 14 days.
The Quarantine Act was invoked by Hajdu on March 26, making self-isolation a legal mandate for travellers (excluding essential workers) returning to the country, and also prohibiting those who are symptomatic from using public transit as transport to their place of self-isolation, and prohibiting self-isolation in settings where they may come in contact with those who are vulnerable (people with pre-existing conditions and the elderly).Since March 16, only Canadian citizens and their immediate families, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens are allowed to enter the country.
The only exceptions are flight crews, diplomats, and trade and commerce.
Travellers showing COVID-19 symptoms are not allowed to board flights into Canada, regardless of their citizenship.
International flights to Canada from outside the Caribbean, Mexico, and the U.S. were instructed to land at either Calgary International Airport, Montréal–Trudeau International Airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport, or Vancouver International Airport.
Since March 20, Canada and the United States have temporarily restricted all non-essential travel across their border, while maintaining supply chains between both countries; On April 16, Trudeau stated that the Canada/U.S. border restrictions would remain in place "for a significant amount of time"; the next day, it was reported that Canada and the United States had agreed to extend their entry restrictions, which were to expire on April 21, for an additional 30 days beyond that date.
The border restrictions were later extended until at least September 21, 2020.Since March 30, individuals showing COVID-19 symptoms must be refused boarding on domestic flights (10 seats or more) and passenger trains.
This excludes buses and intercity passenger rail services.
Since April 20, all travellers are required to wear face masks while departing and arriving on air travel, including during security screenings.
Those who do not comply will be prevented from proceeding.
As the border with the United States continued to be closed to non-essential travel, the Canadian government announced plans in October to allow family members to reunite under compassionate terms.
Within the country, the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador established the Atlantic Bubble, restricting travel from other provinces, but allowing free movement amongst residents of the member provinces.
Due to the second wave, the Atlantic Bubble was suspended in November 2020.

On January 6, 2021, the federal government announced that all incoming travellers must present proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test conducted within 72 hours of their departure time in order to board flights into Canada.
On January 29, 2021, due to concerns surrounding SARS-Cov2 variants, Trudeau announced a series of new travel restrictions.
Travellers arriving in Canada will be required to receive a COVID-19 PCR test on arrival, and must quarantine at an "approved hotel" at their own expense while they await test results or recover, and are subject to "increased surveillance" during the remainder of the mandatory 14-day isolation period.
On February 12, it was announced a third PCR test would be required at the end of the 14-day isolation period.
The new rules for international travel will go into effect on February 22.Foreign flights are only allowed to land in Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, or Vancouver.
In addition, all flights to the Caribbean and Mexico have been suspended until April 30.

====
Governmental cancellations ====
A First Ministers' meeting scheduled for March 12 and 13 was cancelled after Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire entered self-isolation.
The Canadian House of Commons was suspended between March 14 and April 20, immediately after passing the new North American free trade deal.
The federal budget, previously scheduled for March 20, was also suspended.

====
Bank of Canada rate changes ====
In March 2020, the Bank of Canada twice lowered its overnight rate target by 50 basis points—first to 1.25 percent on March 4, and then to 0.75 percent on March 13.
It cited the "negative shocks to Canada's economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices" in explaining the move.
On March 27, the Bank lowered the rate a third time to 0.25 percent, citing "serious consequences for Canadians and for the economy" due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Bank also launched a program to "alleviate strains in the short-term funding markets" and another program to acquire Government of Canada securities at a minimum of $5 billion per week.

====
Federal aid ====
On March 18, the federal government announced an $82-billion response package with a variety of measures.
On March 25, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act received royal assent from Governor General Julie Payette.
The measures in this first package included:

Canada Child Benefit (CCB):
Payments for the 2019–20-year were increased by $300 per child.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) credit:
The maximum annual GST credit payment amount for the 2019–20 year was doubled.

Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB):
This new benefit provided a taxable benefit of $2,000 a month for up to four months for those who had lost their job, were sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone sick with COVID-19, as well as working parents staying home to take care of their kids.

Canada Student Loans
: A six-month moratorium was placed on repayment.

Temporary business wage subsidy
: Eligible small employers received a three-month 10 percent wage subsidy.

Tax flexibility
: The income tax filing deadline was also extended from April 30, 2020 to June 1, 2020.
Tax payments were deferred to September 2020.The CERB launched on April 6.
On April 15, Trudeau announced that the CERB would be extended to workers making up to $1,000 per month, and that the government planned to work with the provinces to implement salary top-ups for essential workers who make less than $2,500 per month.
The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) was announced on April 1, an expanded version of the temporary business wage subsidy.
The Parliament reconvened on April 11 to pass the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act, No.
2 on division.
It implemented the CEWS—which allows eligible companies to receive a 75 percent subsidy on each of their employees' wages (up to their first $58,700)
for 12 weeks retroactive to March 15.Trudeau introduced new financial aid programs on April 10, including the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) which offers loans, interest-free until the end of 2022, of up to $40,000 for small- and medium-sized businesses.
The CEBA was expanded on April 16 to make more businesses eligible.
The Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) was announced by Trudeau on April 22.On April 30, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux issued a report projecting the federal deficit for fiscal year 2020 could be in excess of $252 billion, based on nearly $146 billion in spending on federal aid measures.
On October 12, 2020, the federal government rolled out a new income support program after the ending of CERB, the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB).
Another program, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) supports Canadians that have been working but have to take a break to care for dependents (a child below 12 years of age or a disabled family member).
The benefit only applies if schools and care centres are closed, or the dependent fell sick, or contracted COVID-19.

=====
Oversight =====
On July 3, 2020, the Ethics Commissioner announced an investigation into Trudeau and the government's decision to have WE Charity administer the summer student grant program.
We Charity was criticized for its close ties to the Trudeau family.
On the same day, Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, Bardish Chagger, announced that WE Charity would no longer be administering the Canada Student Service Grant program.

====
Industrial strategy ====
On March 20, 2020, the government announced a plan to ramp up production of medical equipment, switching assembly lines to produce ventilators, masks and other personal protective gear.
Companies will be able to access funds through the government's Strategic Innovation Fund.
The PM stated that Canadian medical supply firms Thornhill Medical, Medicom and Spartan Bioscience were looking to expand production.
In order to address shortages and supply-chain disruption, Canada passed emergency legislation that waived-patent protection, giving the government, and companies or organizations that it selects, the right to produce patented products without permission from the patent holder.
According to Innovation, Science and Industry minister Navdeep Bains, "the country's entire industrial policy will be refocused to prioritize the fight against COVID-19".
====
Virtual care ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, 34% of people consulted their doctors over the phone.
In May 2020, Justin Trudeau announced an investment of $240.5 million to support the growth of virtual care and mental health tools in Canada.

===
States of emergency ===
On March 12, Quebec declared a public health emergency, requiring international travellers to self-isolate for 14 days and banning gatherings of 250 people.
The ban has been extended to all gatherings outside workplaces and retail.
On March 16, Prince Edward Island declared a public health emergency.
Alberta and Ontario declared emergencies on March 17, followed by British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan and Yukon on March 18.
New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia declared emergencies on March 19, March 20, and March 22 respectively.
These emergencies allowed provinces to ban gatherings and require international travellers to self-isolate.
On March 25, mandatory self-isolation was imposed federally, making it a legal requirement for all provinces who had not done so already.
New Brunswick, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and have all restricted entry through interprovincial borders, prohibiting the entry of non-residents without valid reason.
Quebec has additionally restricted travel into 9 of its 18 regions and parts of 3 other regions.
The borders of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are being screened, while also requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days upon entering the province.

====
Schools and universities ====
Public schools (under Provincial control) across the country quickly followed suit and closed.
Schools in the Toronto District School Board were closed under a 2-week class-free quarantine beginning on the week after the regularly scheduled March Break.
Virtual learning was implemented in the week following the quarantine, and extended until the beginning of the next school year, when students were given the option of going in-person with restrictions or continuing virtual learning.
March Break was pushed back to the week of 11 April.

Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, was the first to voluntarily suspended classes and moved to online instruction on March 12.
This was quickly followed by many other universities across the country.

====
Business closures ====
Bars, restaurants, cinemas, and other businesses have been ordered closed by provinces, territories, and municipalities across the country.
Initially, some jurisdictions allowed restaurants or bars to stay open with reduced capacity and social distancing.
Takeout and delivery orders are largely still permitted.
Jurisdictions have differed on daycare closures.
In particular, British Columbia and Saskatchewan have faced criticism for allowing daycares to remain open while closing schools, bars, and restaurants.
Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan have mandated the closure of all businesses not deemed essential by the provinces.
Essential businesses include grocery stories, takeout and delivery restaurants, pharmacies, transportation, manufacturing, food production, energy, and healthcare.
Liquor and cannabis stores have largely remained open across the country, with governments reversing their closure orders due to concerns surrounding alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

====
Aid programs ====
Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Manitoba all offered one-time payments that aimed to bridge the gap before the implementation of the federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
Quebec's Temporary Aid for Workers Program offers up to four weeks of payments for those who do not qualify for federal assistance.
Prince Edward Island also provides payments to those who have kept their jobs but work reduced hours.
Many provinces and territories have increased payments for those already receiving income supports.
===
Courts ===
Courts across the country instituted measures to reduce public contact, while maintaining access to the courts.
The Supreme Court of Canada has closed the building to public tours, while maintaining the ability to file documents for cases electronically.

It has also adjourned appeals which were to be heard in March, to dates in June.
Other courts have prioritized the cases which will be heard, generally giving priority to ongoing criminal trials and trials in family and child protection matters, while adjourning most pending cases to later dates.

===
First Nations ===
On March 19, the Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba restricted entry to essential travellers, and Chief David Monias said the Sayisi Dene and others are doing the same.

As of March 19, the Council of the Haida Nation said it was discouraging all non-resident travel to the islands "for the time being.
"On
March 27, Wasauksing First Nation declared a state of emergency with Gimaa (chief)
Wally Tabobondung announcing the creation of a response team and the state of emergency via YouTube video.
In an update posted on May 16, the chief and council announced they had installed cameras with facial and licence plate recognition technology at local checkpoints to identify outsiders entering the territory.
Cottagers leasing property on the territory had been barred from entering until June 6.
As of June 6, anyone entering the Wasauksing must have a tag issued by the band government and provide information for a centralized registry.
Re-opening has been occurring in phases.
As of an update posted June 21, the state of emergency had been extended an additional 90 days.
On October 1, in anticipation of the "Second Wave,"
Tk’emlups te Secwepemc Secwépemc First Nation instituted a mandatory face mask policy in indoor spaces where physical distancing was not possible, including hallways, staircases, and shared vehicles.
As of October 8, the infection rate in Indigenous communities had been one-third of the infection rate in non-Indigenous communities, according to an update from Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller in which he praised Indigenous leadership and, along with Indigenous Services Canada's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tim Wong, encouraged Indigenous people to remain vigilant and safe.
First nation communities are prioritized amongst others in the first phase of vaccinations against the virus.

testing ==
COVID-19
testing can be used to track the prevalence and spread, to diagnose individuals for treatment, to identify infections for isolation and contact tracing, to screen at-risk populations, to clear exposed healthcare workers to return to work, and to identify individuals with potential immunity.
The World Health Organization says that jurisdictions should aim to test every suspected case of COVID-19.
Since health care is under provincial jurisdiction, almost all testing is conducted by the provinces and territories rather than the federal government.
On April 23, Trudeau identified broader testing as key to reopening the country, mentioning the target of 60,000 tests per day set by Dr. Theresa Tam, but warned that up to 120,000 per day may be required.
As of late April, approximately 20,000 tests per day were being performed in Canada.
Total numbers of tests conducted for the provinces and Canada show that over 800,000 Canadians have been tested as of early May 2020.
The displayed chart shows the testing rates per capita in the provinces and territories from March to May 2020.

===
Role of the Government of Canada ===


====
Federal approval and regulation of diagnostic tests ====
Only COVID-19 tests approved by Health Canada can be imported or sold in Canada.
Since this is usually a lengthy process, on March 18, Minister of Health Hajdu issued an interim order to allow expedited access to COVID-19-related medical devices for use by healthcare providers, including diagnostic test kits.
The same day, the first commercial tests were approved, RT-PCR tests from Roche and Thermo Fisher.
Another 13 diagnostic products have since been approved, all based on Nucleic Acid tests.
As of April 30, 21 diagnostic device applications were listed as submitted by Health Canada.

====
National Microbiology Lab ====
Canada's National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg performs diagnostic testing for and research into COVID-19.
Samples from suspected cases early in the pandemic were sent by provinces and territories to this national lab for testing, either as the sole test or as a check of an in-province test result.
The first confirmed case in Canada was diagnosed by the lab on January 27, 2020.
Since then, provinces and territories have established their own testing capacity but have occasionally sent samples to the national lab for a second test as a check.

====
Federal facilitation of testing ====
Provinces have faced
COVID-19 testing backlogs due to a shortage of supplies, including the chemical reagents required to complete the tests.
In late April, the federal government arranged for a cargo flight from China that delivered the equivalent of about six to nine months of production for one particular raw material for the 20-odd raw materials needed by supplier LuminUltra to supply reagent kits for RT-PCR machines.

===
Types of COVID-19 tests ===


====
Virus-RNA tests ===
=
Health Canada identifies nucleic acid-based testing as "the gold standard used in Canada and abroad, for the diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection in patients with symptoms.
"
The predominant type of testing used is RT-PCR.
In it, a carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose.
The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres in the corresponding province or territory.
At the centres, highly skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time.
The test chemically strips the RNA from the sample then mixes it with a test kit containing chemical reagents designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2.
The sample is cycled between a set of temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature.
This leads to processing times that range from 4 to 24 hours.
The actual RT-PCR test is 99 percent accurate.
However, false negative results are estimated to occur 8 to 10 percent of the time due to poor swabbing technique and might be as high as 30 percent depending on how long after symptom onset the test was performed.
Provinces have faced
COVID-19 testing backlogs due to a shortage of the chemical reagents and swabs required to complete the tests.

=====
Virus-RNA test reagent kits =====
LuminUltra Technologies Ltd. of Fredericton is producing reagent test-kits to use with automated RT-PCR machines.
On April 15, Trudeau announced that the company would be "ramping up production ... to meet the weekly demand in all provinces."
The company announced the same day that it would provide "500,000 urgently needed COVID-19 tests per week to the Canadian federal government for use across Canada."
=====
Canadian-made viral RNA test systems =====
Spartan Bioscience of Ottawa signed contracts with the federal government and the provinces of Alberta, Quebec, and Ontario to supply virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes.
Together the contracts were for over one million swab test kits, and at least 250 handheld devices.
On April 13, Health Canada approved this test, but on May 3 the test was recalled due to unreliable results.
Precision Biomonitoring of Guelph signed a Letter of Intent on March 31 with the federal government to co-develop a novel point-of-care test kit for COVID‑19, which is now pending an authorization from Health Canada.
Their 1.2 kg battery-operated mobile device performs nine tests per hour and takes 60 minutes to produce a result.
Bio-ID Diagnostics of Edmonton developed a direct 24-hour virus test that can be scaled to 20,000 samples per day.
Since it is based on sequencing DNA it avoids false positives, and it detects a low concentration of the virus substantially reducing false negatives in asymptomatic individuals.
On October 5, Health Canada approved a portable PCR test — the Hyris bCUBE —which was based on technology developed at the University of Guelph and can process tests in 90 minutes.

====
Serological testing for antibodies ====
These blood tests look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and range in complexity from laboratory tests to at-home kits similar to pregnancy tests.
Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection.
However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.
Health Canada has been evaluating a number of antibody tests.
Health Canada deemed that "Serological tests are not appropriate for early diagnosis of COVID-19, largely due variability in the time required after infection to develop antibodies."
On May 12, 2020, Health Canada announced the first antibody test approved for use, a laboratory test from DiaSorin, an Italian multinational biotechnology company.
Health Canada wrote that the test will "contribute to a better understanding of whether people who have been infected are immune to the virus."
=====
Research and population immunity =====
Health Canada posts "studies will be required to determine how long the antibodies remain detectable, whether for weeks, months or years" and "the relationship between antibodies and immunity to future viral infection."
Nonetheless, many countries are conducting or planning large-scale testing to determine what proportion of the population has been infected and is potentially now immune.
As of April 20, the WHO estimated that at most 2 to 3 percent of people in affected countries have been infected.
On April 23, 2020, Trudeau created a COVID-19 Immunity Task Force of researchers, including Dr. Tam, Dr. David Naylor, and Dr. Mona Nemer, to coordinate monitoring of immunity and vulnerability to COVID-19 in the Canadian population.
The taskforce will oversee national antibody surveys over the next two years in which will test one million Canadians.
Researchers at Sinai Health's Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto are developing a robotic system that can process mass numbers of antibody tests.

=====
Canadian-made antibody tests =====
MedMira of Halifax developed one of the first rapid detection kits for HIV and has now developed a COVID-19 antibody test that takes three minutes from taking the blood drop specimen.
Plantform Corp. of Guelph applied for funding from the National Research Council to develop an antibody test for COVID-19.

====
Rapid antigen testing ====
Tests for antigens, proteins that are part of the surface of the virus, were first approved by Health Canada on October 6, when it approved and ordered 20.5 million units of one manufactured by Abbott Laboratories as a point-of-care test.
They can produce results faster than PCR tests (in around 20 minutes), but are generally considered to be less accurate than PCR tests.
Abbott states that they are designed for preliminary results and not intended "as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions."
Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Howard Njoo stated that these tests could be deployed in settings such as workplaces and communal living environments.

=====
Canadian-made rapid antigen tests =====
Sona Nanotech of Halifax was developing point-of-care COVID-19 antigen test kits that provide results in 5–15 minutes and is anticipated to cost less than $50.
If successful, the project will yield 20,000 test kits available per week, with the potential to scale-up to 1 million test kits per week.

Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases and historical data by Johns Hopkins University
The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States is an ongoing mass immunization campaign to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.
Following the FDA's approval of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 10, 2020, mass vaccinations began on December 14, 2020.
The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was later approved for use on December 17, 2020, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was approved for use on February 27
, 2021.The campaign was initiated by the U.S. government under the presidency of Donald Trump, and transitioned to Joe Biden, who became the new President of the United States on January 20, 2021.
He began his term with an immediate goal of a hundred million shots in his first hundred days in office, signing an executive order which included increasing supplies for vaccination.
This goal was met on March 19, 2021.
On March 25, 2021, Biden announced he would set a new COVID-19 vaccine goal of 200 million shots being given within his first 100 days in office.
This goal was met on April 21, 2021.
==
Vaccination program ==
Vaccines were distributed to states on a population basis, with the vaccine rollouts being administered by each individual U.S. state.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that hospital workers and nursing home personnel be the first individuals vaccinated.
The subsequent phases of the rollout are determined by each individual state agency.

===
Eligibility of non-citizens ===
On February 1, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security said it "fully support[s]
equal access to the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine distribution sites for undocumented immigrants" and that related federal agencies "will not conduct enforcement operations at or near vaccine distribution sites or clinics.
"While
, generally, states may have intended that vaccines be prioritized for residents rather than for tourists—especially international visitors—there was some difficulty communicating and enforcing this.
Most adults have driver's licenses, but many do not, and otherwise the United States doesn't automatically provide each citizen with identity documentation in a centralized system.
Furthermore, when people did not show up for their vaccine appointments, many clinics vaccinated anyone else who happened to show up so that the doses would not be wasted.
As a result, some tourists as well as undocumented immigrants were vaccinated.
As of early February 2021, states including Florida, California, New York and Texas were specifically trying to restrict "vaccine tourism": brief visits to the US with the primary intention of obtaining a vaccine.
However, contrary to rumors that spread on social media, the United States did not have a policy of cancelling visas or imposing fines on tourists who sought vaccination.
Diplomats pointed out that the B1/B2 tourist visa allows people to seek medical treatment while within the United States, even if they do not turn out to be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.

==
Background ==
From early 2020, over 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research.
The global competition had national security implications for various countries.
In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5 billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act.
Among the labs working on a vaccine is the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which has previously studied other infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, ebola, and MERS.
By March 18, tests had begun with dozens of volunteers in Seattle, sponsored by the U.S. government, and similar safety trials were planned for other potential vaccines.

Bill Gates, whose foundation shifted its focus nearly entirely to the pandemic, anticipated in early 2020 that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021.On August 5, 2020, the United States agreed to pay Johnson and Johnson more than $1 billion to create a hundred million doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
The deal gave the U.S. an option to order an additional two hundred million.
The doses were supposed to be provided for free to Americans if they are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

BIO, a trade group including all makers of coronavirus vaccines except AstraZeneca, tried to persuade Secretary Azar to publish strict FDA guidelines that could help ensure the safety and public uptake of the vaccine.
Politics impacted scientific practice, however, when chief of staff Mark Meadows blocked the FDA when it was realized that the timing of the provisions would make it impossible for a vaccine to be authorized before the November election.
Ultimately, the guidelines emerged from the Office of Management and Budget and were published on the FDA website.
As of October 2020, 44 were in clinical trials on humans, and 91 pre-clinical vaccines were being tested on animals.
On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the FDA announced that its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) would review the request.
On December 11, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine.
An initial shipment of 2.9 million doses were scheduled to be distributed rapidly, and Pfizer promised to continue supplying the rest of the hundred million doses through March 2021.
Pfizer had adequate stocks available and began this distribution on December 17, 2020, but the federal government reduced the amount that Pfizer was allowed to distribute.
On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020.
The U.S. planned to rapidly distribute 5.9 million doses with more to come later.
On February 27, 2021, the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the FDA for use.
However, this vaccine has faced backlash from some government officials, believing it to be not as effective as Pfizer or Moderna.
On March 5, the mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, rejected a shipment of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, saying, "Moderna and Pfizer are the best.
And I am going to do everything I can to make sure the residents of the city of Detroit get the best."
After backlash, Duggan declared he would no longer decline the vaccine.
On March 11, 2021, President Joe Biden announced in an address that he would direct all states to make vaccines available to all adults no later than May 1.
On April 6, 2021, President Joe Biden stated that he would direct states to make all adults eligible for vaccination by April 19, nearly two weeks before the original date of May 1.
This deadline was met after several states opened up vaccination to everyone 16 and above the same day.

March 2021 ====
On March 12, 2021, the United States of America surpassed 100 million doses administered.
Over the course of the month, seven states (AK, MS, OH, CT, AZ, TX, and GA) made the vaccine available to all adults, following a period of selective vaccination for elderly and other vulnerable populations.
California and Washington announced that all adults would be eligible for a vaccine starting April 15.
Indiana announced that it would make vaccines available to university students and would specifically facilitate the transfer of vaccines to university-based vaccine clinics, including one such clinic at the University of Notre Dame.

====
April 2021 ====
On April 3, 2021, more than four million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were reported administered in the past 24 hours, setting a new record and bringing the seven-day average to more than three million a day.
As of April 11, more than 187 million vaccine doses have been administered.
On April 13, 2021, the CDC and FDA issued a statement recommending a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six women aged 18 through 48 developed a rare and severe type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
On April 23, 2021, the recommended pause was lifted.
As of April 28, 2021, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported an average of 2.7 million daily vaccinations over the past week.

A poll conducted May 20–21, 2020, found that 44% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats believed a debunked conspiracy theory that Bill Gates was plotting to use a COVID-19 vaccine to inject microchips into the population.
In early December 2020, a majority of Black and Latino Americans were at least hesitant, if not opposed, to receiving the vaccine.
By late February 2021, hesitancy had dropped among Black and Latino people.
During the same time period, however, anti-vaccine opinions held steady among white Republicans, one-quarter of whom remained firmly opposed to getting the vaccine.
A Monmouth poll conducted April 8–12, 2021 found that two-thirds of Democratic voters had already been vaccinated but only one-third of Republican voters had done so.
A Quinnipiac poll conducted on the same dates found that 45% of Republicans said they did not plan to be vaccinated.
The New York Times wrote that the vaccination program was "hitting what appears to be a soft ceiling" as it moved to dealing with the demographic groups where vaccine hesitancy was stronger.
As of April 9, 2021, the vaccine was optional for U.S. Marines, and 39% of those to whom the military offered it had refused it.
It is possible that some of them planned to be vaccinated elsewhere.
If large numbers of military personnel remain unvaccinated, it could "affect force readiness," CNN noted.
The highest rate of declination was at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where 57% of Marines had refused the vaccine.
As of April 22, 2021, only a third of active U.S. military service members have received COVID-19 vaccinations, with the U.S. Navy with the highest percentage of active military personnel receiving one dose at 51%, with the Marines at 36%, the Air Force/Space Force at 34%, and the Army at 27%.A Frank Luntz poll in mid-April 2021 found a rise in vaccine confidence from the previous month, despite the pause of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
60% of Trump voters, and 72% of Biden voters said they agreed with the statement "
The bottom line is COVID-19 vaccines save lives, and Americans should continue to get vaccinated as soon as possible."

COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the government of the Philippines through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).

The strictest of these community quarantines is the "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ), which effectively is a total lockdown.

==
Background ==
Given the rapidly increasing number of cases in Metro Manila,
Albay 2nd district representative Joey Salceda proposed a week-long lockdown of the region to prevent the disease from spreading nationwide.
Salceda specifically proposed the closure of the Philippine expressway network and public transportation accessing the region, in addition to the suspension of classes and work.
President Duterte initially rejected the proposal claiming it would "hamper the flow of basic commodities".
Secretary Duque, however, raised the possibility of a lockdown on certain cities or towns if cases of community-based transmissions are reported, but not an entire region.
On March 12, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering Metro Manila, that began on March 15.

At one point during President Rodrigo Duterte's pronouncement about the Metro Manila "community quarantine," he said that "they are afraid to call it a lockdown, but it is a lockdown."
This statement left many confused.
His cabinet secretary, Karlo Nograles, later made it clear that the proper term is "community quarantine" and the President's comment means that the event "is like a lockdown".
Nograles further said that the term "lockdown" can lead to different interpretations, while "community quarantine" is a technical term that medical authorities can give meaning, which does not create public fear.
When the "community quarantine" was applied to Luzon, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo, said that the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) is equivalent to an "absolute lockdown or total lockdown."
Secretary Eduardo Año of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) also said that "enhanced community quarantine" should be considered as a "total lockdown.
"In
addition, President Duterte advised local government units outside of the National Capital Region to implement a community quarantine in cases where, in a given level of local government, at least two COVID-19 cases are confirmed within a lower level of its jurisdiction; for example, a province-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
COVID-19 cases confirmed within different cities or municipalities in the same province, while a city/municipality-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
COVID-19 cases confirmed within different barangays in the same city or municipality.
Local government units were also authorized to utilize their quick response funds upon declaration of a state of emergency.
The national government has given local government units under enhanced community quarantine in Visayas and Mindanao and relevant field offices of the Department of Health the power to lift or extend the lockdown period in their jurisdiction.
The imposition of a "localized lockdown" involving measures at the barangay, sitio, and/or purok level instead of fully lifting ECQs has been proposed.
On April 6, the following localities were under enhanced community quarantine: all regions of Luzon, Western Visayas, Caraga Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, Samar, Biliran, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, Sultan Kudarat, Lanao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Cotabato, South Cotabato, Tawi-Tawi, and the municipality of Catarman in Northern Samar.
On April 24, it was clarified that local government units can no longer impose quarantine measures without the consent of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
Prior to that period, localities could impose such measures with coordination with the DILG.
President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order 112, extending enhanced community quarantine in select localities until May 15 and imposing a general community quarantine in the rest of the country, also overriding existing quarantine measures by local government units, starting May 1.
==
Classification ==
The four main levels of community quarantine measures are the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ), the general community quarantine (GCQ), and the modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).
Although exact measures per level may vary over time due to the government revising its guidelines, the strictest of these measures is the ECQ and the most lenient being the MGCQ.

===
Enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) ===
Localities under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) are generally ordered to stay at home, with its residents restricted from traveling to other cities or barangays.
Barangay governments can issue quarantine passes allowing residents to buy essential goods outside curfew hours and within the issuing barangays' jurisdiction.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act which was effective in 2020 also provides measures related to the ECQ, such as:
Limitations on an all forms of transportation
Work suspensions and the setting up of alternative working arrangements such as teleworking
Ensuring the supply of food and medical products
Measures against profiteering and hoarding of essential goods
Provision allowing a 30-day grace period for loan and rental payments during the quarantine period
Cancellation of mass gatherings
Closure of non-essential businesses
24/7
opening of essential businesses and utilities in 100% operational
capacityWhen ECQ was reintroduced in March 2021 in the Greater Manila Area (or NCR Plus as designated by the IATF-EID); new set of measures were observed.

All households are required observe strict home quarantine.
Movement outside the place of residence is limited to Authorized Persons Outside Residence (APORs), those accessing essential goods and services, and workers in establishments allowed to operate.
People aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant women are barred from going out their homes except to either obtain essential goods and services or to report for work.

Mass gatherings (more than 10 persons
outside and non-household members indoors) and face-to-face classes are not allowed in ECQ zones.
Religious gatherings and dine-in services are not allowed.
Shopping malls are allowed to operate for essential services.

Limitations on mass transportation.

Essential and priority constructions projects are allowed to resume in accordance with Department of Public Works and Highways guidelines
In addition to front-line services (health and other emergency services); full operations is allowed for certain operations including agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and delivery and courier services of essential goods.

Limited operations for certain sectors.
Unlike in 2020, ECQ measures as of 2021 had more lenient restrictions on transportation allowing for operations of public transportation at a limited capacity.
However, with the ECQ period in March-April 2021 coinciding with the Holy Week and late release of guidelines of the Department of Transportation, this resulted in the virtual absence of public transportation in some areas.

===
General community quarantine (GCQ) ===
The general community quarantine (GCQ), which was introduced on May 1, is generally less stringent than ECQ.
Public transportation is allowed at a reduced capacity and select businesses are allowed to operate at 50 to 100 percent of their regular capacity depending on their industry.
Shopping malls are also allowed to operate, although only select stalls and stores are allowed to open.
A level under GCQ, is called a modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).Sporting activities has been allowed in areas under GCQ since July 2020, although live spectators are not allowed for sports events.

===
Other measures ===
There are types of quarantine or lockdown measures aside from the ECQ and GCQ.
Additional measures have been imposed under an "extensive enhanced community quarantine" or "extreme enhanced community quarantine" (EECQ).
An EECQ is generally stricter than an ECQ.
Prior to the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon, a more lenient measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a curfew, was imposed in Metro Manila and was officially called a "community quarantine".
Several LGUs has used the term "hard lockdown," which is an area under disease monitoring and mass testing for the virus.
In May 2020, additional terms were coined by the government to categorize the community quarantine according to its risk assessment and those new terms are "modified enhanced community quarantine," "modified general community quarantine" and "new normal.
"A "total lockdown" measure, distinct from an ECQ, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving their places of residence and mandate the closure of all public establishments.
According to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, this measure is considered as an option.
A "special concern lockdown" can be applied to only a portion of a barangay with a high concentration or clustering of active cases of COVID-19.
It can be a road, a compound, or a block.

A classification of measures called "new normal", a level under MGCQ, was introduced sometime in June 2020, but has not yet been used.
An area needs to be placed under MGCQ prior to the imposition of new normal measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first case in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020 and involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila.
On February 1, a posthumous test result from a 44-year-old Chinese man turned out positive for the virus, making the Philippines the first country outside China to record a confirmed death from the disease.
After over a month without recording any cases, the Philippines confirmed its first local transmission on March 7, 2020.
Since then, the virus has spread with at least one case being recorded in the country's 81 provinces.
Socio-economic status has been associated with the prevalence of COVID-19 cases across the country.
Lockdowns, or community quarantines, have been imposed throughout the country since March 15, 2020 as a measure to limit the spread of the virus.
The largest of these measures was the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon.
As of April 29, 2021, the Philippines has reported 1,028,738 cases of the disease.
Out of these cases, 942,239 recoveries and 17,145 deaths have been recorded.
In terms of confirmed COVID-19 cases, it has the 2nd highest in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia), ranks 7th in Asia, and 26th in the world.
The largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases was reported on April 2, 2021, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 15,310 new cases.
The Philippines had a slightly lower testing capacity than its neighbors in Southeast Asia during the first months of the pandemic in the country.
COVID-19 tests had to be taken outside the country due to the lack of testing kits.
This also has led to a controversy that involved several government officials who were reported to have undergone COVID-19 tests without qualifying to the DOH's triage algorithm.
By the end of January 2020, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila began its testing operations and became the country's first subnational laboratory.
Several laboratories have been accredited by the DOH since then.
As of April 25, the country has 249 subnational laboratories capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has conducted a total of 11,581,020 tests from more than 10,882,337 unique individuals.

==
Timeline ==


===
January to February 2020 ===
The Philippines reported its first suspected case of COVID-19 in January 2020.
It involved a 5-year-old boy in Cebu, who arrived in the country on January 12 with his mother.
At that time, the Philippines had no capability to conduct COVID-19 tests.
The boy tested positive for "non-specific pancoronavirus assay" in the RITM.
Samples from the boy were also sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia to determine the specific coronavirus strain.
The boy tested negative for COVID-19 but several suspected cases were already reported in various parts of the country.
The RITM developed capability to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-19 cases.
It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30.The first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed on the same day.
The diagnosed patient was a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 21.
She was admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25 after she sought a consultation due to a mild cough.
At the time of the confirmation announcement, the Chinese woman was already asymptomatic.
The second case was confirmed on February 2, a 44-year-old Chinese male who was the companion of the first case.
His death on February 1 was the first recorded outside China.
He suffered from coinfection with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
On February 5, the DOH confirmed a third case in a 60-year-old Chinese woman who flew into Cebu City from Hong Kong on January 20 before she traveled to Bohol where she consulted a doctor at a private hospital on January 22, due to fever and rhinitis.
Samples taken from the patient on January 24 returned a negative result, but the DOH was notified on February 3 that samples taken from the patient on January 23 tested positive for the virus.
The patient upon recovery on January 31 was allowed to go home to China.

===
March 2020 ===
After a month of reporting no new cases, on March 6, the DOH announced two cases consisting of two Filipinos.
One is a 48-year-old man with a travel history to Japan, returning on February 25 and reported symptoms on March 3.
The other is a 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on February 25 and was admitted to a hospital on March 1 when he experienced pneumonia.
He had last visited a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan.
The DOH confirmed that the fifth case had no travel history outside the Philippines and is, therefore, the first case of local transmission.
A sixth case was later confirmed, that of a 59-year-old woman who is the wife of the fifth case.
Since then, the Department of Health recorded a continuous increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country.
Cases abroad involving foreigners with travel history in the Philippines were reported in early March 2020.
The first three recorded cases involving an Australian, a Japanese, and a Taiwanese national had a history of visiting the Philippines in February 2020.
Though it was unconfirmed whether or not they had contracted the virus while in the Philippines, speculations arose on undetected local transmissions in the country due to prior confirmation of the Philippines' first case of local transmission.
Retrospective studies have been made to determine the strain of virus responsible for causing the community outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines since March 2020.
In May 2020, Edsel Salvaña, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and member of the IATF-EID, said that the strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in the country that started in March 2020 is closely related to the strain affecting India at the time.
The virus strain's family tree is said by Salvaña to have appeared in China and Australia.
In a July 2020 webinar led by Cynthia Saloma, Executive Director of the UP Philippine Genome Center two hypotheses was presented regarding the source of the March 2020 outbreak in the Philippines.
Genetic sequence analysis of samples collected from Philippine General Hospital patients from March 22–28 suggest that there are at least two sources of viral transmission in the Philippines; China, mainly from Shanghai and from Japan specifically through repatriated Filipino seafarers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Several measures were imposed to mitigate the spread of the disease in the country, including bans on travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and South Korea.
On March 7, 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) raised its "Code Red Sub-Level 1," with a recommendation to the President of the Philippines to impose a "public health emergency" authorizing the DOH to mobilize resources for the procurement of safety gear and the imposition of preventive quarantine measures.
On March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No.
922, declaring the country under a state of public health emergency.
On March 12, President Duterte declared "Code Red Sub-Level 2," issuing a partial lockdown on Metro Manila to prevent a nationwide spread of COVID-19.
The lockdowns were expanded on March 16, placing the entirety of Luzon under an "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ).
Other local governments outside Luzon followed in implementing similar lockdowns.
On March 17, President Duterte issued Proclamation No.
929, declaring the Philippines under a state of calamity for a tentative period of six months.
Additional facilities started to conduct confirmatory testing.
On March 20, four facilities, namely the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Benguet, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila (where the first case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the RITM.
Other facilities began operations as well in the following days.
On March 25, the President signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which gave him additional powers to handle the outbreak.

===
April to May 2020 ===
By April, COVID-19 had spread to all 17 regions of the Philippines, with the confirmation of a case in April 6 of a patient confined at a hospital in Surigao City who had been in the Caraga region since March 12 after traveling from Manila.
President Duterte on April 7 accepted the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to extend the ECQ in Luzon until April 30.On April 17
, it was reported that the country had been able to bring down the viral disease' reproduction number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the average number of people a person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one.
Recent data at the time suggested that the country was doing better in "flattening the curve", but was warned of a "resurgence" and must ramp up mass testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further transmission of COVID-19.Sometime in late April, local government units (LGUs) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine measures without the consent of the IATF-EID.
Prior to that period, LGUs could impose such measures in coordination with the Department of the Interior and Local Government.
The ECQ in Luzon was extended until May 15 in some areas.
This included Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Central Luzon (except Aurora), Pangasinan, and Benguet.
ECQ measures were also extended in the provinces of Iloilo and Cebu as well as in Davao City.
Other areas were downgraded or placed under general community quarantine (GCQ).

On May 14, Typhoon Vongfong (local name: Ambo) landed on Samar Island.
In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the dual threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex and dangerous evacuation.
At each shelter in the central part of the Philippines, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, only half of the capacity was accepted, and a mask was required when evacuating.
Typhoon Vongfong killed five people in the Philippines.
By the time Vongfong landed, the number of confirmed infections was 11,618 and the number of deaths (due to infectious diseases) was 772 in the Philippines.
Vongfong also approached Manila, but due to severe restrictions on going out of Manila, most people, including low-income people living in simple houses, could not go to shelters and were forced to wait at home.
After May 15, the Philippine government revised its quarantine classifications in correspondence to an earlier announcement that "Science and Economics will be considered for any changes of the lockdown measures."
A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was applied to Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City, while a GCQ was raised to 41 provinces and 10 cities with moderate risk.
Meanwhile, 40 provinces and 11 cities that were considered "low-risk areas" were supposed to be released from community quarantine measures, but were eventually upgraded to a "modified general community quarantine" (MGCQ) after a reportedly "honest mistake" from the national government and requests from respective LGUs.
Once again, the Philippine government revised its announcements and declared the entire country under GCQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu City continued to implement an MECQ.
This was temporary until guidelines of MGCQ for low-risk areas were finalized.
The IATF-EID also reportedly considered the reclassification of provinces and cities in Central Luzon as "high-risk areas" under MECQ.After receiving petitions from LGUs,
the IATF-EID revised its quarantine policies yet again.
Cebu City and Mandaue were placed under ECQ, while Metro Manila, Laguna, and Central Luzon (except for Aurora and Tarlac) were all under MECQ.
The remaining parts of the country were placed under GCQ.

=== June to July 2020 ===
Quarantine measures raised throughout the country started to loosen up on June 1, with areas formerly under ECQ transitioning to a less strict quarantine.
This led to a significant rise in the number of confirmed cases, as more areas implemented a GCQ.

The official start of classes in the elementary and secondary schools which customarily begin on June was postponed.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act expired within this month.
According to the national government, the law expired on June 25, due to its sunset provision although there were interpretations that the law expired as early as June 5.
Senator Sonny Angara argued that per the Constitution "emergency powers cease upon the next adjournment of Congress" and that he considers the Bayanihan Act as an emergency measure.
The national government maintains that the law was to expire on June 25.
Upon expiration of the law, the national government is not anymore obliged to hand out cash subsidies to families affected by community quarantine measures.
The DOH reported an overwhelmingly high number of recoveries on July 30, as the department began its "Oplan Recovery" to clear out its discrepancies with LGU counts.
Under the data reconciliation of the DOH, starting from July 15, mild cases and asymptomatic cases will be recorded as recovered after 14 days from swab collection for testing.
The first set of "mass recovery" was recorded on July 30 with 37,180 recoveries.
From July 30, recovery reconciliations will be reported every 15 days.

===
August 2020 ===
On August 2, the Philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the country continues to report around 2,000–3,000 cases a day.
The country eventually had the most COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia when it finally breached Indonesia's total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was placed in Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal from August 4 to 18 as a response to the petition of medical front liners requesting an ECQ in Metro Manila.

In early August, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) became involved in a corruption scandal, and its executives were alleged to have used the pandemic as a cover-up to steal billions of pesos.
The Philippine Genome Center (PGC) had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in the Philippines.
The new variant is said to be globally dominant variant than other variants of the virus at the time of detection and has been associated with the sudden increase of new cases in July.
By August 18, the DOH has identified 1,302 COVID-19 clusters throughout the country with the majority being located in Metro Manila.

===
September to November 2020 ===
On September 11, President Duterte signed Republic Act
No.
11494 or the Bayanihan
to Recover as One Act into law.
President Duterte then extended the period of the state of calamity until September 2021, through his Proclamation
No.
1021 filed on September 18.The IATF-EID
also announced on September 18 that all cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial parks nationwide will be closed from October 29 to November 4 to prevent social gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the All Saints' Day observance.
This is similar to the proposal made by Metro Manila mayors few days prior.
COVID-19 has spread to all provinces in the Philippines by September 28, when Batanes recorded its first case.

=== December 2020 ===
In mid-December, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as Lineage B.1.1.7 was identified in the United Kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than earlier variants of the virus.
This has led to several countries to restrict or ban travel from the United Kingdom, including the Philippines.
The Philippines also banned travel from 19 other nations which has reported cases of more-infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2.The DOH announced in a briefing held in January 2021 that the U.K. variant is already in the Philippines as early as December 2020.
One of the samples collected by the health department on December 10 tested positive for the variant on January 21, 2021.

=== January 2021 ===
By January 2021, the DOH is already monitoring at least two other noted mutations aside from the U.K. variant, namely the 501.V2 variant which originated from South Africa and another variant from Malaysia.
On January 5, 2021, Hong Kong reported that they detected the U.K. variant from a 30-year-old woman who arrived in the city from the Philippines on December 22, 2020, raising concerns that the strain may already be in the Philippines.
The following day, a joint DOH–PGC study said that it has not detected the U.K. variant among 305 samples collected from November to December hospital admissions involving inbound travellers who have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in the country.

Epidemiologist John Wong, who is part of DOH's technical advisory working group, said in a press briefing on January 6 that if Lineage B.1.1.7 establishes itself in the Philippines, the total number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold.
Wong provided two scenarios which assumed there are 20,000 cases at the beginning of the month.
In the first scenario, COVID-19 has a r rate of 1.1 and the U.K. variant does not reach the Philippines which project an increase of cases to 32,000 by the end of the month.
In the second scenario where Lineage B.1.1.7 does indeed establish itself in the country, the projected rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the same time period.
On January 13, the DOH announced that the U.K. variant has been detected in the country when a 29-year-old man from Quezon City, who arrived in the country from the United Arab Emirates on January 7, tested positive for COVID-19.
13 individuals who came in contact with the man also tested positive for COVID-19 days later.
On January 22, 16 new cases associated with the U.K. variant has been confirmed in several places in country including Benguet, Laguna, and Mountain Province.
A case each in Benguet and Laguna had no known contact with a confirmed case or a travel history outside the country.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to the Pfizer–BioNTech and the Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccines on January 14 and 28, respectively.

=== February 2021 ===
On February 18, the DOH in Central Visayas announced that two mutations of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Cebu.
The mutations were classified as "mutations under investigation" and were tagged as E484K and N501Y.


===
March 2021 ===
The DOH announced the detection of the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Pasay on March 2.
On March 12, Lineage P.1, commonly known as the Brazilian variant, was detected in the country, along with a "unique" variant originating from the Philippines which was designated as the P.3 variant, which in turn related to the aforementioned variant.
Japan also detected the P.3 variant on a man who traveled from the Philippines.
As a response to the recent spike in cases, the Greater Manila Area, which the government called "NCR Plus", was placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) on March 22 and was originally set to expire on April 4.
It was further intensified to the stricter enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March 29 to April 11, when the positivity rate of the area remained high.
On March 17, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that there have been at least 27,967 deaths caused by, or associated with, COVID-19 by the end of 2020.
19,758 of these were tagged "COVID-19 virus not identified", while 8,209 were tagged "COVID-19 virus identified".
The discrepancy between the tallies of the DOH and the PSA is due to the inclusion of probable and suspect cases in the PSA's tally.

=== April 2021 ===
On April 2, the Philippines has logged 15,310 new cases, the highest number of daily cases since the beginning of the pandemic.

==
Cases ==


===
By location ===
Metro Manila, having over 430,000 cases and 6,000 deaths, is considered as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines.
More than half of the total number of cases in the country is attributed to the region.
It is followed by the neighboring Calabarzon and Central Luzon regions with a combined total of 254,064 cases.
Bangsamoro, on the other hand, has the lowest number of cases in the country.

===
By demographic ===


====
Front line workers ====
As of April 25, 2021, there have been 17,365 healthcare workers that tested positive for COVID-19.
17,082 out of these cases have already recovered, while 88 have died.
On the early months of the pandemic in the country, the number of healthcare workers infected by the virus was significantly higher compared to the infection rate of other health care workers in the Western Pacific Region.
By January 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 virus had infected more than 9,381 police officers from the Philippine National Police (PNP), 1,137 military personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and 160 members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG).
====
Locally stranded individuals ====
The arrival of locally stranded individuals (LSI) on their home provinces has been associated to new clusters of the disease in previously least affected regions.

====
Repatriates ====
Of the 1,098,954 returning overseas Filipinos (ROF) reported on April 25, 2021, 1,093,400 have tested negative for the disease and have been discharged from quarantine facilities, while 16,614 have tested positive.

====
Overseas Filipinos ====
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) provides information regarding the number of Filipino nationals abroad to have contracted COVID-19.
The DFA keeps an official tally of confirmed Filipino COVID-19 cases per region instead of by country.
As of April 26, 2021 there have been 18,253 overseas Filipinos from 93 countries and territories that tested positive for COVID-19.
This count is not included in the national tally of cases by the DOH.

===
Suspected cases ===
The DOH previously used the designation "patients under investigation" (PUIs) and "persons under monitoring" (PUMs) to manage suspected and confirmed cases.
PUIs involved individuals who had a travel history to Wuhan but by February 3, 2020, the DOH has expanded the scope of PUIs to include individuals who had a travel history to any part of China.
"
Persons under monitoring" are asymptomatic individuals with known history of exposure to another person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
On April 11, 2020, the DOH revised its terminology for PUIs; "suspect" and "probable" cases.
Suspect cases involve individuals exhibiting flu-like symptoms and have a history of travel to areas with reported local transmission within 14 days before the manifestation of their symptoms.
Someone with fever, cough, or shortness of breath who is above 60 years old, pregnant, with other underlying illness, or a health worker could also be considered as a suspect case.
Patients admitted to a hospital due to severe symptoms caused by an undetermined lung disease could also be tagged as a suspect case.
Probable cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further validation, and those who were tested but whose test was not facilitated in an official laboratory for a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test.
The usage of the PUM designation has since been discontinued.
It was reasoned that it is assumed that the general public has been exposed to COVID-19 due to local or community transmission already ongoing in several parts of the Philippines.
By July 14, 2020, there had been 38,909 suspected cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the country.

==
Medical response ==


===
Hospital admission policy ===
The DOH has issued a reminder, that Level 2 and 3 hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and refusal of admission is a "violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the PhilHealth accordingly".
The department said that Level 2 and 3 hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms while individuals in a serious or critical condition may be transferred to one of the DOH's three main referral hospitals, which was increased over time to 75 designated hospitals as of April 13 with a combined bed capacity of 3,194.

On March 16, the DOH announced a revision on their protocol on hospital admission for COVID-19 positive patients.
A week prior, the DOH has began sending both asymptomatic patients and individuals with mild symptoms back on their homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until they have been deemed recovered.
Priority are given to high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms for hospital admission.

===
Drug therapy and vaccine development ===


====
Vaccine trial participation ====
The Philippines, with at least 45 other countries, has joined the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Solidarity trial to study the effectivity of certain drugs in treating COVID-19 patients.
Dr. Marissa Alejandria of the Philippine Society of Microbiology and Infectious Disease is the Philippines' representative in the study with Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire as the official liaison of the DOH in the multinational study.
The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) announced that it is seeking bilateral collaboration with other countries such as China, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom on endeavors related to the vaccine development for COVID-19.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a bounty for anyone who could produce a vaccine against COVID-19, an amount later increased to ₱50 million (around $1 million).

====
Research on other treatments ====
The Philippine Council on Health Research and Development at the DOST plans to distribute an undisclosed "functional food," while Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque also revealed that the DOST, Philippine General Hospital, and the Ateneo de Manila University, are collaborating with the Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore to evaluate the feasibility of lauric acid from virgin coconut oil, Vitex negundo (known locally as Lagundi), and Euphorbia hirta (known locally as Tawa-tawa) as a "dietary regimen supplement" to help COVID-19 patients combat the disease.
A "functional food" or "dietary regimen supplement" is described as similar to how tawa-tawa is also used as a remedy against dengue by incorporating it to the diet of diagnosed patients.

===
Vaccination ===


====
Supply ====
The Philippine government has been negotiating with various foreign vaccine manufacturers to secure the country's COVID-19 vaccine supply.
These manufacturers include Sinovac Biotech (China), Gamaleya Research Institute (Russia), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States).
The private sector, with government sanction, has secured at least 2.6 million vaccine doses from British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca.
Negotiations are also ongoing with American firm Novavax which would supply at least 30 million doses from the Serum Institute of India.
The country is projected to at least 60 million doses from various manufacturers in 2021.The procurement efforts of the national government has been a subject of various controversies.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque has been alleged to "dropped the ball" in a deal with Pfizer vaccine deal which could have secured 10 million doses by as early as January 2021.
Plans to secure 25 million doses from China's Sinovac has also been put into scrutiny in the Congress due to its reported efficacy rate.
Late stage trials of Sinovac's vaccine  in Brazil reported an efficacy rate of only 50 percent.
There were concerns within the Senate that the reported 50-percent efficacy rate of Sinovac's vaccine would not garner public trust and would be a waste of government funds.
The Department of Health said that Sinovac's vaccine satisfy the World Health Organization standards of at least 50 percent efficacy rate while the FDA pointed out that Sinovac is yet to publish an official and published scientific report on their vaccines efficacy rate and that the clinical trial for the vaccine is conducted in different countries and the efficacy rate per country will vary; as low as 50 percent in Brazil and as high as above 90 percent in Turkey.

==== Authorization and usage ====
On December 2, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
Under certain conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a month instead of undergoing the usual six-month review process.
Among the conditions is for a vaccine manufacturer to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a "mature" regulator.
The FDA announced that three vaccine manufactures namely Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have inquired on the process of obtaining an EUA in the Philippines.
On December 23, Pfizer has applied for an EUA for its vaccine.
Duterte also said in December 2020 that some members of the military already received COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer, Sinopharm despite the vaccine not yet officially approved by the country's health authorities.
Few days later, it was reported that some members of the Presidential Security Group had also received vaccine from unknown manufacturer.

===
Testing ===
Early COVID-19 testing in the Philippines was only limited to persons with travel history to countries with cases of local transmission and those with exposure to the individuals confirmed to have COVID-19.
The testing protocols were revised sometime in mid-March 2020 to give priority to the testing of any individual with severe symptoms as well as to the elderly, pregnant and immunocompromised persons with at least mild symptoms.
On March 30, symptomatic healthcare workers are also considered priority for testing.
During his press briefing on May 19, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that the people aimed to be tested in the government's "expanded targeted testing" are as follows: "(1)
all symptomatic cases, (2)
all of those coming from abroad, (3) all close contacts of confirmed cases that were found through contact tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid antibody tests.
"
The government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the Philippines' entire population and 10–12% of the worst affected region in the country, which is Metro Manila.
In late March 2020, some politicians and their relatives were reportedly tested for the disease despite not showing any symptoms, causing public backlash amidst a shortage of testing kits since it was against DOH guidelines to test asymptomatic individuals.
The DOH responded to the public criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no policy for VIP treatment" with regard to testing for COVID-19 and that "all specimens are being processed on a first-in, first-out basis," it "extends courtesy" to front line government officials, specifically those involved in national security and public health.
Some senators who were tested claim that they used rapid antibody tests not accredited by the DOH at that time.
On January 24, 2021, after receiving a go-signal from the national government, the Philippine Red Cross announced that they will start conducting COVID-19 tests using saliva samples on January 25.

====
Testing capacity ====
In July 2020, there were currently 85 testing laboratories nationwide with 25,000 tests conducted daily.
The country has conducted over 3 million tests as of September 2020.On March 9, 2020, a total of 2,000 tests has been conducted at a rate of 200 to 250 people accommodated by tests per day.
The testing capacity of the Philippine government has been expanded by late March 2020.
As of March 23, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa alone can test 600 people per day, other laboratories except for the facility of San Lazaro Hospital, Manila, can do 100 tests, while the said hospital can do 50 tests per day.
By March 27, the release of test results conducted at the RITM takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the institute is committed to reducing the turnaround to two to three days.
The DOH announced that the country will conduct targeted mass testing on April 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible, probable, and high-risk patients, such as health workers, expectant mothers, and patients with other medical conditions.
The country's testing continuously increased, except when RITM temporarily scaled down its operations from April 20–24 after 43 of its staffs tested positive for the virus.
The Philippines has the capability to conduct mass testing, either through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rapid antibody testing, given the increased number and improving capacity of the country's accredited laboratories and the procurement of more testing kits.
The first localized targeted mass testing began in Valenzuela, Metro Manila on April 11.
Other local government units followed suit shortly after the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) adopted a resolution that commences 'a national government-enabled, local government unit-led, and people-centered response' to COVID-19.

====
Testing kits ====
The Food and Drug Administration has approved the usage of 75 PCR test kits (including one locally developed kit), 79 rapid antibody testing kits, 53 immunoassay testing kits, and 7 other testing kits as of July 30.

A locally developed PCR testing kit has been made by the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines Manila.
It is reportedly six times cheaper than its foreign counterparts.
It was first approved for commercial use in April 2020 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but some kits were recalled in May by its manufacturer, after it was found out that testing using the kits yields indeterminate results 30 percent at the time.
A month later, the testing kit were re-approved after its defects were fixed.

====
Testing facilities ====
Before January 30, there were no medical facilities in the country that can confirm cases of the virus.
Before that date, the RITM conducted preliminary tests on suspected cases to determine if they are infected with a coronavirus but could not detect the new strain on patients.
Samples from suspected cases with confirmed coronavirus infection had to be sent abroad to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing specifically for SARS-CoV-2.The National Task Force for COVID-19 created the Task Force T3 (Test, Trace, and Treat) to establish public-private partnerships that would conduct mass testings.
The task force cited the San Miguel Corporation as a pioneer in the move to open its COVID-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of its 70,000 employees.
As of August 24, the country has 110 subnational laboratories capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2.

====
Testing backlogs ====
From May 29 to June 17, 2020, the DOH had included testing backlogs on their daily case bulletin.
These backlogs were referred to as "late cases" and were validated by the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau after more than four days of the release of test results.
Late cases were reported alongside new cases or "fresh cases", which corresponded to the cases that were validated three days within the release of test results.
This change was implemented by the health department to clarify the sudden increase of cases in the country.
The then-largest single-day increase on the number of confirmed cases in the country has been accounted to the backlog in late June 2020, when 2,434 new cases were announced.
1,147 out of these cases were fresh cases and the remaining 1,287 were late cases.
It surpassed the backlog in late May 2020, where 1,000 out of 1,046 cases were reported to be late cases.

==
Government response ==


===
Nationwide measures ===
The national government declared a state of calamity over all of the Philippines on March 16, 2020, by virtue of Proclamation
No.
929 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte.
The declaration brings into effect for six months the following:
price control of basic needs and commodities,
granting interest-free loans,
distribution of calamity funds,
authorization of importation and receipt of donations, and
hazard allowance for public health workers and government personnel in the fields of science and technology.

====
Legislative response ====
Following the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would authorize Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated ₱438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic.
In the House of Representatives, the bill was introduced as House Bill No.
6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros–Taguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district.
In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No.
1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors.
The House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate.
President Duterte signed the bill into law on March 25.
The law was effective for three months until June 25, owing to its sunset provision.
A legislation was proposed to replace the Bayanihan Act, dubbed as the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2.
On August 20, the bicameral committee approved a reconciled version of the bill.
It was signed into law by President Duterte on September 11.

===
Lockdowns ===
The government has varying levels of lockdown and/or stay-at-home orders across all the country's local government units characterized as "community quarantines".
The strictest of these measures is designated as enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).
Restrictions were imposed on various aspects of society such as mass public transportation, mass gathering, and operation of businesses.

In April 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte warned anyone who violates the country's lockdown measures could be shot for causing trouble.

===
Travel restrictions ===
Travel of foreign nationals to the Philippines is banned with few exceptions since March 2020.
The issuance of visas to all foreign national on March 19 was stopped and all visas already issued are voided except to those issued to families of Filipino nationals would remain valid.
Three days later a travel ban was imposed on all foreign nationals, except spouses of Filipino citizens (and their children), and workers for international organizations and non-governmental organizations accredited in the country.

===
Foreign aid ===
The government of China and the United States has pledged support to the Philippine government response against COVID-19.
China announced that it would be donating medical supplies including 100,000 testing kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks, and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment.
The United States Agency for International Development also pledged $2.7 million worth of aid to help the Philippines develop adequate testing capabilities, and ensure the availability of medical supplies through the agency's "on-the-ground partners".
China's aid was received on March 21, 2020.On March 22, 2020, the DFA said that the Philippines would be receiving a donation from Singapore consisting of 3,000 testing kits and a polymerase chain reaction machine.
In early April 2020, the DFA announced it received 20 units of testing kits, capable of 1,000 tests, from Brunei.
The United Arab Emirates also donated medical supplies in May 2020.On March 28, 2020, it was disclosed that some of the test kits made in China were only 40% accurate in testing for signs of the COVID-19 on an individual suspected to be infected with the disease.
The test kits were donated by a private foundation.

Economic impact ==


===
Economic indicators ===
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) revised its economic growth outlook for the Philippines in 2020 from a 6.5% to 7.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth registered in late 2019 to a 5.5% to 6.5% GDP growth, following the pandemic.
The NEDA cited the decline in service exports, especially tourism.
Moody's Analytics also reduced their GDP growth outlook for the country, from 5.9% in 2019 to 4.9% following the pandemic.
Meanwhile, Nomura gave a bitter prediction of 1.6%, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave an almost flat growth of 0.6% for this year before rebounding to 7.6% in 2021.Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno and
then-NEDA Director-General Ernesto Pernia forecast that the Philippine economy would likely enter a recession in 2020 due to the effect of the pandemic.
Diokno stated that, although the first quarter is likely to grow by 3% since the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine only took effect near the end of the quarter, the second and third quarters would likely experience contractions in economic growth.
The Philippines' real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 1998, a year after the Asian financial crisis, with a technical recession deemed "likely" to be posted within 2020.On the other hand, the BSP records an inflation rate of 2.2% in April and 2.5% in March compared from 2.6% in February and 2.9% in January.
The average rate of 2.6% for the period of January to April 2020 is also 1% lower compared to the inflation rate from the same period in the previous year.
The event was primarily and hugely caused by lower oil prices and transportation costs, even if the prices of food supplies and alcoholic beverages and tobacco slightly rose.
In terms of the amount of economic loss that the Philippines is projected to suffer, NEDA gave a value of up to ₱2.0 trillion, or equivalent to about 9.4% of 2020 nominal GDP, while the Philippine Institute for Development Studies estimates at a maximum of ₱2.5 trillion.
International organizations also gave their predictions, with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation envisioning a ₱273-billion loss and the Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières envisioning a combined loss of more than ₱1 trillion just in the month of April.
The pandemic also affected the goal of the Philippines to be among the countries with upper-middle-income country status by nominal GNI per capita.
Before his resignation, Pernia said that the country will still achieve this goal by 2020, while his replacement, acting NEDA Director-General Karl Kendrick Chua, said last May that this goal will be achieved in 2022.
Daniel Ross of Bloomberg also stated that the Philippines, which is "an economic star poised to outpace long-time regional winners such as China, Indonesia and India," will face hindrances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 9, 2020, the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) index lost 457.77 points or 6.76%, its steepest decline since the financial crisis of 2007–08.
The following day, shares plunged by 6.23% to ₱5,957.35 (US$117.54), settling below the 6,000 level benchmark and entering the bear market territory.
The mining and oil industries were the most affected with a 9.05% drop, followed by holding companies with a 6.93% drop.
The PSE's circuit breaker mechanism was invoked for the second time since the measure's introduction in 2008 halting trade for 15 minutes.
The Philippines' GDP saw its worst contraction since World War II posting a growth of −9.5% for 2020 according to the Philippine Statistics Authority records from 1947.
The last full-year contraction was in 1998 amidst the Asian financial crisis where the GDP grew by −0.5%.
The 2020 contraction was also worse than the – 7% contraction in 1984.

===
Employment ===
In terms of unemployment rate, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) records an estimated unemployment rate of 5.3% in January 2020, which is the same with January 2019.
Moody's Analytics puts its estimate at 5.3% for the first quarter of 2020, while Nomura expects 7.5% for Q1 and a 13-year high of 8% in Q2 of this year.
Meanwhile, the IMF stated that the unemployment rate in the country would be 6.2% for this year compared to 5.1% in 2019.
A higher rate of 6.8% for this year was also predicted by S&P Global Ratings.
The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines estimates that around 7,000 people may lose jobs within the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic.
Economists from the Ateneo de Manila University estimate that 57% of the country's workforce may be displaced within the end of the first quarter of 2020.
It comprises around 15 million workers in Luzon that were laid off due to the enhanced community quarantine, around four million of whom are based in Metro Manila, as well as an estimated 4.3 million workers in Visayas and another 4.3 million in Mindanao that were laid off due to quarantine restrictions.
In March, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) stated that 1.05 million workers were displaced due to the pandemic, even after they released guidelines for employers in handling the impact of COVID-19.Philippine aviation services were heavily affected after travel, both locally and internationally, was restricted to contain the spread of the virus.
Some German businesses that are based in the country also reported to reduce investments in the country, but will continue to maintain their employees.
In early 2021, there were reports that some employers are requiring its workers to get vaccinated before allowing them to physically report for work, with some workers threatened to be placed on floating status if they are not able to comply.
DOLE released a statement that such practice is illegal and workers should be only vaccinated on a voluntary basis.

Food service and supply ===


====
Services ====
Following directives from the Philippine government, several fast food and restaurant chains suspended dine-in services and restricted operations to take-out and delivery.
Following the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine, online food ordering services such as GrabFood and Foodpanda temporarily halted but eventually resumed operations in Luzon during the quarantine period.
Several restaurants and coffee shops across the country offered free food and beverages to front line professionals involved in the pandemic, especially health care workers.

====
Production and distribution ====
Food production and distribution slowed down during the pandemic, especially in Luzon, primarily due to the lack of financial assistance and inaccessibility of transportation resulting from community quarantine measures being implemented across numerous local governments.
The delivery of fresh vegetables from the province of Benguet, which supplies the country with over 80 percent of the country's highland vegetable requirements, was halted due to the implementation of an "extreme enhanced" community quarantine in La Trinidad.
Local government officials advised local rice farmers to sell their harvests to them, assuring them that they would help distribute it to their respective communities amid the border restrictions.
On March 27, Vietnam announced that it would reduce its production and exportation of rice due to food security amid the pandemic.
The Philippines, the largest importer of rice in the world, imports 25% of its rice from Vietnam.
Agriculture Secretary William Dar assured that there would be "no shortage of the staple during the duration of the enhanced community quarantine and beyond" as "harvest [
is] already coming in."
Dar also stated the Department of Agriculture's plans to initiate early planting in the Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon, two of the largest rice producers in the country, ahead of the third quarter of 2020.Production of canned fish in the country was adversely affected with Zamboanga City, which accounts for 85% of the country's canned fish industry, announcing it would reduce the production of canned fish in the Philippines by 50–60% due to difficulties encountered following the implementation of a city-wide lockdown.

===
Gambling ===
The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) ordered the suspension of all gaming operations in the country, including the land-based casinos in Entertainment City and Newport City, on March 15.
The gaming regulator also announced that they were limiting the operations of Philippine offshore gaming operations in the region.
Illegal gambling activities conducted online, including online cockfighting or e-sabong, through social media has proliferated amidst the pandemic.
PAGCOR has aimed to regulate online cockfighting, as part of efforts to expand the source of funds for the government.

===
Medical supply ===
A shortage of medical masks was reported in various parts of the country due to concerns over the pandemic.
RITM director Celia Carlos urged the public against hoarding masks to ensure ample supply for medical workers directly dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, are acting against reports of traders hoarding face masks and selling said item at an overpriced rate.
The DTI has also directed its Philippine International Trading Corp. to import 5 million masks from overseas.
Medtecs International Corp. Ltd., the sole manufacturer of medical mask in the country, has committed to supply the government through the DTI.Doctors in the Philippines have deplored the shortages in personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, and was even cited as the cause of high infection rate and death rate of healthcare workers in the country.
To address this issue, the Philippine government continues to procure and stockpile such equipment, as the pandemic is expected to last until 2021.According to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, the country also issued requests for ventilators and respirators that will be used for severe or critical COVID-19 patients, as there are reported shortages of these equipment.

===
Retail ===
According to the Philippine Retailers Association, the "total retail environment" saw a decline of 30–50%.
SM Investments, the country's largest retailer, saw a decline of 10–20% in domestic sales.
Despite the decline, most retail stores that provide essential services, including supermarkets, convenience stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies, remained open across the country to sustain consumers while other establishments at malls closed down.
Such retail stores, however, imposed strict social distancing measures with some supermarkets only allowing 50 customers inside at a time and placing stickers on the floor to indicate that customers must stand one meter apart from each other.
Stores were also regularly disinfected and customers were required to undergo a temperature check before entering.
In the Greater Manila Area, several online grocers continued to operate, but with limited delivery slots.
After most industries in the country being closed for two months, many stores in the retail sector are already allowed to open under revised guidelines of eased community quarantines.
Panic buying and hoarding became rampant across the country, especially with essential goods such as food and sanitation products.
The Philippine Amalgamated Supermarkets Association reported that the purchases of masks, alcohol, and other personal hygiene products in supermarkets across the country had already surged, urging the public against panic buying.
Economic think-tank Fitch Solutions forecasts that the consumer and retail sector, especially non-essential businesses, would be one of the hardest-hit sectors in the Philippines as it loses sales revenue for an entire month due to the Luzon enhanced community quarantine (Luzon accounts for 73% of the country's GDP).
Fitch Solutions forecasts the household final consumption expenditure for the country in 2020 to expand by 6.7% year-over-year, which was adjusted from a "pre-coronavirus projection" for 2020 of 7% growth year-over-year.
Mall operators across the country, such as Ayala, Megaworld, SM, Robinsons, and Vista, initially shortened the operating hours of its malls to comply with government quarantine measures.
While doing so, malls were asked to implement social distancing measures; for example, several malls implemented a "single-seat gap" policy in cinemas, in which moviegoers were required to sit one seat apart from each other.
However, most malls in the country have since limited its operations to establishments providing essential services, particularly groceries, banks, and hardware stores.

===
Travel ===
Local airlines AirAsia, Philippine Airlines, and Cebu Pacific suspended flights in response to the imposition of travel bans by the Philippine government and some foreign governments.
The airlines have suspended flights as early as February 2, 2020, covering routes involving destinations in China, Hong Kong and Macau.
At least Philippine Airlines has suspended all of its flights by March 2020, although the airline has announced plans to resume selected flights by June 1, 2020.

Social impact ==


===
Census ===
The 2020 census of population and housing in the Philippines was originally scheduled in May but was postponed indefinitely due to the increasing number of cases in the country.
As the quarantine measures began to ease, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) started to conduct the census in September, despite the risk of spreading the virus.

===
Education ===


====
2019–20
academic year ===
=
Suspension of classes began as early as March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 16, the Department of Education (DepEd) issued guidelines prohibiting public schools in areas with suspended classes from administering the final examinations of students and instead compute the students' final grades for the 2019–20 academic year based on "their current academic standing."
and directed schools in other areas to administer final examinations within that week on a "staggered basis" and for teachers and students to observe social distancing measures.

Some universities resorted to implementing online learning alternatives.
The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also advised institutions of higher education to implement distance education methods of learning for its classes, such as the use of educational technology, to maximize the academic term despite the suspensions; However, following the announcement of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and other areas, colleges and universities suspended mandatory online classes in consideration of the welfare of its students, faculty, and staff.
Academic administration offices continued to operate with a skeleton crew, while other offices in colleges and universities operated through telecommuting arrangements.
Some schools, however, continued to hold online classes, and in response, several student groups appealed to CHED to suspend mandatory online classes in consideration of the logistical limitations and well-being of a majority of students.
Classes in all levels across the country were eventually suspended due to the pandemic.
Graduation rites in Philippine schools were also either canceled, postponed, or held virtually.

The official start of classes for the 2020–21 school year could only be legally set as late as the last day of August.
However, Republic Act
No.
11480 was signed into law to allow the start of classes to be set beyond August.
The Department of Education has moved the opening of classes to October 5, 2020.
Earlier in June, officials reported that schools will not open until a vaccine is available, though remote learning should resume at the end of August.
A group of UP experts has proposed the start of classes to be pushed back to December in order to limit the spread of the disease.
CHED left the decision of starting semesters to college administrators, although urged them to shift into the new semestral calendar and start 'flexible classes' in August and face-to-face classes in September as well.
Certain measures have been proposed to be implemented during the opening of classes, such as the airing of lectures on television and radio, a "mandatory face mask policy," maintaining physical distancing, and limiting class sizes.

===
Tourism ===
The NEDA reported that the coronavirus pandemic would incur a ₱22.7 billion ($448 million) monthly loss of tourism revenue for the Philippines and the impact of the pandemic could last around five to six months based from past experiences from the SARS, H1N1, and the MERS outbreaks.
Over 5,200 flights covering two months, which was to be serviced by member airlines of the Air-Carriers Association of the Philippines, were canceled.
Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank predicts a ₱111 billion ($2.2 billion) loss in the tourism sector, while the Tourism Congress of the Philippines estimates the figures at around ₱20 billion ($395 thousand), considering that 12.7% of the Philippines' GDP is generated through tourism.
Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières also reported potential damage in Philippine tourism.
The National Museum of the Philippines temporarily closed its complex in Manila and all branch museums throughout the country.
The Philippine Shopping Festival, a nationwide mall sale event backed by the Department of Tourism originally scheduled on March 1–31, 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Several local festivals across the country were also either canceled or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
===
Prisons ===
The impact of COVID-19 in prisons in the Philippines is projected to be "dangerous," since its jails have the highest occupancy rate in the world that stands at 534%.
The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology has temporarily suspended the acceptance of visitors in prisons it manages as early as March 2020, encouraging would-be visitors to avail the e-dalaw service which would allow inmates to communicate with relatives online.
Certain human rights groups raised their concerns on the issue.
Human Rights Watch flagged the cases of dying inmates in prison cells and called for the freedom of minor offenders, the elderly, and the ill.
Karapatan and KAPATID both called for the release of political prisoners that belongs to vulnerable sector as a way to decongest Philippine jails amidst COVID-19 pandemic.
A group of 22 high-risk prisoners (either of old age, immunocompromised, or pregnant) also asked for temporary liberty due to 'humanitarian grounds' since "hellish prison conditions in the Philippines make the detainees vulnerable to COVID-19.
"
All of the 22 prisoners, five of which are consultants of New Peoples' Army (NPA), are asking to be allowed to post bail or to be released under personal recognizance.
They are represented by Public Interest Law Center (PILC) and the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL).
Similarly, one of the suspects in the death of Horacio "Atio" Castillo III pleaded for freedom under the guise of the COVID-19's threat.
In mid-April, the Supreme Court (SC) reiterated its 2014 circular, which allows the temporary freedom of "persons deprived of liberty" who were able to serve their minimum penalty during an ongoing trial or those whose trial are paused due to lack of witnesses.
Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra also signed resolutions that relaxes bail prices for indigent inmates and requirements to avail parole and executive clemency.
On May 2, Associate Justice Mario Victor Leonen announced that there were 9,731 detainees released temporarily by the SC from March 17 to April 29 as a way to alleviate the country's overcrowding prisons.

===
Entertainment and media ===
The DOH issued an advisory for the cancellation of large public events and mass gatherings, such as concerts, until further notice to minimize the risk of spreading the disease.
This prompted several local and international artists to either cancel or postpone their scheduled concerts and fan meets.
Local television networks temporarily stopped admitting live audiences for their television shows, including variety shows Eat Bulaga!
on GMA Network as well as
It's Showtime and ASAP on ABS-CBN.
On March 13, both ABS-CBN and GMA announced that they would suspend productions on their drama shows as well as other entertainment programs by March 15, replacing affected programs with reruns of previous series or extended newscast runs.
Broadcast radio companies are also curtailing their operations during the quarantine period, either by shortening their broadcast hours and/or suspending regular programming in favor of "special broadcasts".

===
Religion ===
The Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines has issued preventive guidelines against the pandemic through the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP).
In January 2020, the CBCP issued a liturgical guideline which urges Mass attendees to "practice ordinarily" the receiving of communion by hand, and avoid holding hands while praying the Lord's Prayer during Mass.
As a spiritual measure against the spread of the disease, the CBCP also composed an oratio imperata (obligatory prayer) which is to be recited during Mass.
In February 2020, the CBCP issued a second liturgical guideline in anticipation of the Lenten season.
The bishops suggested that during Ash Wednesday, ashes would be sprinkled on the faithfuls' head instead of the customary marking of the forehead with a cross to minimize body contact.
The CBCP also urged people to refrain from kissing or touching the cross for veneration during Good Friday, particularly the celebration of the Passion of Jesus.
They suggested genuflection or bowing as an alternative to the practice.
Dioceses across the country have suspended the public celebration of Masses.
On April 8, Holy Wednesday, the CBCP organized an interfaith prayer service against the spread of the coronavirus, which was televised nationwide.
Other Christian denominations and organizations, such as the Iglesia ni Cristo and the Jehovah's Witnesses, have suspended live worship services and resorted to organizing worship services through online platforms.
The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, an organization composed of Evangelical and Protestant church member organizations in the country, also adopted similar measures.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints directed missionaries assigned in the Philippines who are not native to the country to move out for temporary reassignment to another country.
They were ordered to self-quarantine in their new homes for 14 days.
The Islamic community in the Philippines has also adopted measures against COVID-19.

The plebiscite to ratify legislation that proposes the partition of Palawan into three smaller provinces scheduled for May 2020 was also delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===
Misinformation and hoaxes ===
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged online regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and various other aspects of the disease.
Among these hoaxes include:
SARS-CoV-2 being a type of rabies along with advice to not eat bats.
The virus is in the coronavirus family and is unrelated to rabies.

Boiled ginger as a cure for COVID-19.
There is no concrete scientific proof for this claim.
Mark Pasayan, a doctor from the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases says that while a cold weather may make one more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection, the intake of hot or cold food does not correlate with the prevention and treatment of the disease.

In the first week of February, the government supposedly imposed a 14-day quarantine for travelers coming from 20 countries.
An infographic supporting the claim was circulated purportedly from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).
On February 7, the DILG denied the claim.
At that time the quarantine measure is only being imposed from travelers from three territories: Mainland China, Macau, and Hong Kong.

Viral posts with various claims such as avoidance of eating ice cream and cold food, and encouraging exposure to sunlight as a means of prevention against COVID-19 purportedly from UNICEF.
UNICEF Philippines has issued a statement disassociating itself from the posts peddling false and misleading information.

The DOH supposedly issuing an advisory on the proliferation of fake cigarettes which is claimed to be a method of transmission of COVID-19.
The government agency did not issue such advisory.

A widely circulated graphic on social media claimed that gargling warm water with salt would "eliminate the virus."
DOH Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that while the saline water has been a recognized home treatment for symptoms of a sore throat for many generations, there is no evidence suggesting its capability to kill the virus.

A supposed video spread on the internet about how bananas can cure COVID-19.
This information was even advocated by the presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo.
However, DOH Spokesperson Ma.
Rosario Vergeire debunked this claim, saying that while bananas is a healthy food source, there are no conclusive evidences yet about its effectivity against coronavirus.

On March 21, 2020, several netizens on Facebook shared misleading posts about the Philippine Air Force and the Philippine National Police using helicopters to spray pesticides among major cities in an effort to disinfect the virus.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, the Department of Health, and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) have refuted these claims.
Furthermore, the Department of Health added on its official website that there is no evidence that pesticide sprays can kill the Coronavirus.

The Palace also disproved posts circulating online about the declaration of "Total Lockdown" nationwide and warned its peddlers of imminent arrest.
At the time of the circulation, the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon was already in effect.

A controversial statement from President Rodrigo Duterte claiming that gasoline may be used as a disinfectant in absence of hand sanitizers has been refuted by the Integrated Chemists of the Philippines and warned the public that gasoline is harmful to the body especially if inhaled.
The DOH has advised against spreading misinformation and unverified claims concerning the pandemic.
The Philippine National Police has taken action against the spread of misinformation related to the pandemic and has warned the public that misinformation purveyors could be charged for violating Presidential Decree no.
90 for "declaring local rumor, mongering and spreading false information".
In the case of misinformation circulated online, violators could be charged for violating the Cybercrime Prevention Act which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act also punishes fake news peddlers of two months jail time or fine of up to ₱1 million.
According to the DOH, the cremation of the body of the first confirmed COVID-19 death in the Philippines has been hampered by the proliferation of misinformation.

==
Statistics ==
The DOH publishes official numbers through its daily case bulletins at around 4 pm.
The case bulletin initially had been accompanied by a virtual presser discussing the current status of the pandemic in the country.
The virtual presser was discontinued in August and only being held on certain occasions.

===
By region ===


===
By demographic ===
In the table below, the general lethality of COVID-19 in the Philippines is presently given around 1.69%, implying around 2 deaths and 98 potential survivors per 100 cases.
To compare the three well-known coronavirus diseases, the case fatality rate of the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was higher at 11%, while that of the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak was much higher at 36%.

The enhanced community quarantine in Luzon is a series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) on the island of Luzon and its associated islands.
It is part of the COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines, a larger scale of COVID-19 containment measures with varying degrees of strictness.
The "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ) is the strictest of these measures and is effectively a total lockdown.

There were three instances of the ECQ being implemented in Luzon.
The first was implemented between March 17 and May 31, 2020.
This was announced on March 16, two days after the government of the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte placed Metro Manila under a "community quarantine" on March 14.
It was implemented throughout Luzon from March 17 until April 30, and remained in areas with a high risk of infection until May 31.
New degrees such as "modified enhanced community quarantine" (MECQ) and "general community quarantine" (GCQ) were introduced by the IATF-EID during the month of May as easing restrictions commenced, until all restrictions under ECQ and MECQ were downgraded to GCQ and "modified general community quarantine" (MGCQ) on June 1.

After two months of a relaxed GCQ status, a second MECQ was reimplemented in Metro Manila and its immediate surrounding provinces on August 4 and was lifted on August 18.
Finally, on January 24, 2021, a third ECQ was restored in Tabuk while an MECQ was raised in four more municipalities in Kalinga.
It was lifted on February 15.
Due to a recent spike in COVID cases, especially in the Greater Manila Area, another ECQ was reimplemented for the Holy Week starting on March 29 until April 4, which has since been extended until April 11, 2021.

The ECQ affected around 57 million people in Luzon during its peak.
It also resulted in the mobilization of the national and local governments, with the  Bayanihan to Heal as One Act passed to combat the epidemic.
The effectiveness of the ECQ implementation was noted by a study made by the University of the Philippines, although there were also several documented cases of violations of ECQ regulations.
Authorities then pushed for stricter enforcement, which in turn raised concerns of human rights violations.

==
Background ==
Following the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, the Philippine government confirmed the country's first case of the disease on January 30, 2020, when the virus was detected in a Chinese national who traveled from Wuhan, China and Hong Kong.
The second case was confirmed on February 2, the patient being the first death outside mainland China was also Chinese.
Three days later, on February 5, another Chinese national was confirmed to the be third case in the Philippines.
After a month, on March 5, the Department of Health (DOH) announced that the first Filipino in the Philippines confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 who is also the fourth case while the fifth case is the first case of local transmission since the infected person did not travel outside the Philippines.
The sixth case that was confirmed on March 7 is the wife of the fifth case.
In the following days, the number of cases steadily increased.

==
Lockdowns ==


===
Initial lockdowns ===
On March 8, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Proclamation 922 placing the entire Philippines under state of public health emergency because of the COVID-19 threat that is looming in the nation.
On the next day, March 9, Congressman Joey Salceda of the 2nd district of the province of Albay recommended a lockdown of the entire National Capital Region (NCR) for a period of seven days, in response to the COVID-19 threat.
Some of Salceda's proposals for implementing the lockdown include banning mass transportation and stopping the operation of the Philippine expressway network that ply to and from the region, and canceling of classes and work.
At first, President Rodrigo Duterte turned down the idea because it would "hamper the flow of basic commodities," although, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, opined that the lockdown may put into effect in some areas where there are reported community-based transmissions, but not the whole NCR.On March 12, President Duterte announced the "community quarantine" of Metro Manila that would start at 12 midnight on March 15 up to April 14 that covers 16 cities and one municipality.
Traveling through land, domestic air, and domestic sea from Metro Manila was suspended but with exceptions.
For international travel, restrictions are imposed on those who came from countries with localized COVID-19 transmissions, except for citizens of the Philippines (including their foreign spouse and children) or holders of permanent resident visas and diplomat visas.
Mass transportation vehicles are allowed to operate provided that persons riding these vehicles comply with the social distancing guidelines.
Curfew has also put into place by the local government units (LGUs) of Metro Manila.

===
Expansion to Luzon ===
During the second day of the implementation of the Metro Manila community quarantine, on March 16, President Duterte declared a Luzon-wide "enhanced community quarantine" (ECQ) that aimed to further combat the effect of the continuing and increasing spread of COVID-19.
It took effect on March 17 and was supposedly scheduled to end on April 12.
This quarantine also included the Mimaropa region (Occidental and Oriental Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan) despite it being outside the Luzon island.
The Luzon ECQ is described under a March 16 memorandum from Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea by the order of the President as compliance to Proclamation
No.
929
(state of calamity of the whole Philippines due to COVID-19), Proclamation
No.
922
(public health emergency) and Republic Act
No.
11332
(reporting of communicable diseases law).

===
Extensions ===


====
April 30, 2020 ====
On March 30, DOH Secretary Duque said that lifting the ECQ is "too early to assess," citing the Wuhan lockdown was still in effect even if the new COVID-19 daily reported cases are single-digit only.
On the next day, March 31, the Spokesperson of the IATF-EID and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles revealed that the DOH will be the forefront on the technical working group who will set parameters that President Duterte will utilize for making the decision regarding the lifting, extension or expansion of the Luzon ECQ.
He further added that science will decide on the matter.
The IATF-EID met on April 3 and came up with factors in determining the total or partial lifting, or possible extension of the Luzon ECQ.
The factors include social, economic, security, COVID-19 epidemiological curve trends, and health care system capacity.
National Task Force (NTF) COVID-19
chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said that the President is set to decide on the matter between April 12 and 14.
On a televised broadcast on April 6, Duterte said that he is considering to lengthen the Luzon ECQ up to the end of April 2020.
On April 7, Cabinet Secretary Nograles said that Duterte accepted the recommendation of the IATF-EID to extend the Luzon ECQ to April 30.
He further said that the "extension of the ECQ shall be without prejudice to the discretion of the President to relax the implementation of the ECQ in some local jurisdictions, or the granting of exemptions in favor of certain sectors, as public health considerations and food security may warrant."
He also said that there is no need to expand the ECQ to the Visayas and Mindanao.

====
May 15, 2020 ====
According to the April 20 statement of the newly installed Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, the President is 50/50 on deciding the lifting of the ECQ that is expiring on April 30.
Duterte was set to decide on the fate of the Luzon ECQ on April 23
but Roque later said that Duterte will make a public address about the Luzon ECQ on April 24.
He previously met with health policy experts to help him decide on the matter.
According to Senator Bong Go, who was also present during the meeting, said that a modified quarantine is likely to be implemented after April 30.
On the other hand, the WHO recommended on April 22 a gradual lifting of the lockdowns.
The organization earlier advised the Philippine authorities to contemplate on the "epidemiological situation" with regards to the lifting of the Luzon lockdown.
In his address to the public on April 24, Duterte declared that the ECQ is prolonged up to May 15, 2020 only for Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Central Luzon (except Aurora), and other areas in Luzon that are deemed high-risk for COVID-19.
These high-risk areas include Benguet, Pangasinan, Albay and Catanduanes.
On the other hand, beginning May 1, low-risk to moderate-risk areas will be placed under general community quarantine, where implementation is less strict than the ECQ.
====
May 31, 2020 ====
The mayors of Metro Manila proposed three options the IATF-EID may take on May 15: extend the ECQ until May 30, downgrade the quarantine measures to GCQ, or allow the localities of Metro Manila to be placed under a modified GCQ where mayors could place certain barangays under lockdown as necessary.
On May 12, Duterte declared that only Metro Manila and Laguna in Luzon, (and Cebu City in the Visayas) would be under modified ECQ or MECQ from May 16 to 31 because these places are determined as high-risk for COVID-19 while areas that are moderate risk would be under GCQ.It was originally announced by the government that low-risk areas would neither be under ECQ nor GCQ
but they made the statement in error and made it clear that low-risk areas would be under modified GCQ.
Those regions in Luzon that would be under GCQ include Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon except Laguna and Cordillera Administrative Region.
On the other hand, Luzon regions under modified GCQ would be Ilocos Region, Bicol Region and Mimaropa.
On May 15, the IATF-EID made a resolution declaring additional places under MECQ from May 16 to 31 and those places are Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga including Angeles and Zambales.

===
Post-ECQ and reimpositions ===
On June 1, 2020, Metro Manila exited MECQ and transitioned to GCQ as previously announced by President Duterte on May 28, 2020.
Other areas in Luzon, namely, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Albay, and Pangasinan were also placed under GCQ on June 1, while the rest of the country were placed under modified GCQ or MGCQ.

====
August 4–18, 2020 ====
On August 2, the IATF-EID went on a meeting to discuss the petition of medical front liners to reimpose an ECQ in Metro Manila and its surrounding areas.
The meeting later made a decision to revert Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal back to MECQ again from August 4 until August 18.

====
January 24 – February 15, 2021 ====
On January 22, Kalinga Governor Ferdinand Tubban and Tabuk Mayor Darwin Estrañero requested for the re-imposition of the ECQ status in Tabuk.
The MECQ was also imposed in the municipalities of Rizal, Lubuagan, Tanudan and Balbalan.
Two more municipalities were placed in GCQ status, while only Pinukpuk remained in MGCQ status.
However, Pinukpuk was also included in areas under GCQ as the status was reimposed for the entire Cordillera Administrative Region on January 29.
This is due to a rapid increase in infected persons in the province, with the DOH citing Tabuk and the four towns as "critical areas" for virus spread.
On February 6, regional IATF-EID chairperson Araceli San Jose approved the extension of the ECQ in Tabuk until February 15.
Additionally, Tinglayan and Pinukpuk, which were previously under GCQ, intensified lockdown status to MECQ.
Tanudan and Lubuagan remained under modified ECQ.
Rizal and Balbalan were relaxed to GCQ with the rest of the region.

====
March 29, 2021 ====
On March 29, the IATF-EID reimposed the ECQ in the Greater Manila Area due to a surge in COVID-19 cases in the area.
It was originally set to expire on April 4, however, on April 3, it was extended for another week.
On April 11, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the quarantine measure in the area will be downgraded to MECQ for the remainder of the month of April.

===
Specific local government units lockdowns in Luzon ===
Aside from the Luzon-wide enhance community quarantine which restricts the movement of people to and from the island group, several LGUs in Luzon has imposed their own lockdown measures.
Although, the LGUs are bound to comply with the national government rules on the implementation of their own lockdowns as per the directive by the President on March 16.
With the passing of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act on March 25, LGUs are legally compelled to abide with the guidelines set by the national government for the ECQ but still practicing autonomy for matters not defined by the national government or operating under the parameters that have been set.
Here are some of the lockdowns imposed by several LGUs in Luzon:
On March 18, Albay Governor Francis Bichara placed the province under lockdown, ordering the temporarily closure of the province's borders.
Bichara stated that only delivery vehicles of essential goods may be permitted entry and exit of the province, subject to inspection and sanitation procedures.
He also stated that the measure may shorten the period of the Luzon-wide "enhanced" community quarantine for the province by 15 days, if successful.

On March 19, the provincial government of Bulacan carried out the enhanced community quarantine measures, effectively placing the entire province under a lockdown.
Classes were suspended; public transportation systems were put on hold, with the movement of the populace limited to the accessibility of essential needs including basic goods and healthcare services; vital establishments were allowed to remain open, and a curfew from 8:00 in the evening to 5:00 in the morning was set up.
Barangays in several municipalities (such as Bocaue) had issued passes that permit only one member of a family to leave their house for acquiring basic provisions.

On March 23, Pangasinan Governor Amado Espino III placed the province under an "extreme enhanced community quarantine" after health officials confirmed four cases of the virus in the province.
Under the said measure, Espino stated that residents and visitors are prohibited from entering and exiting provincial borders.
In addition, authorities in Malasiqui placed the municipality under a separate "extreme enhanced community quarantine" as two of the four confirmed cases were residents of the municipality.

On March 26, Tarlac Governor Susan Yap announced that the province would be placed under lockdown starting March 29, after it confirmed its first two cases of COVID-19.

On March 28, Laguna Governor Ramil Hernandez placed the province under a "total lockdown" following its rise in COVID-19 cases to more than 20.
Hernandez said the "total lockdown" restricts the movement of people to only front line staff, private firm employees involved in basic services, and only one person per household to purchase essential supplies.
That same day, Bacacay Mayor Armando Romano ordered a 24-hour lockdown on the municipality after a resident tested positive.

With the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the province of Rizal, acting Governor of Rizal Reynaldo San Juan implemented a total lockdown of the Rizal province on April 6 blocking entry and exit of its borders.

Sampaloc, Manila was placed under "hard lockdown" from April 23, 8:00 pm to April 25, 8:00 pm by the order of Mayor Isko Moreno amidst the additional 99 COVID-19 cases of the district.
Moreno also previously ordered the total lockdown of Barangay 20 due to a gathering of an estimated 100 people for a boxing match along a street, which is a violation of ECQ guidelines.

===
Elsewhere in the Philippines ===
With the issuance of Proclamation
No.
922
declaring the entire Philippines under state of public health emergency, all LGUs in the Philippines, including the other two island groups in the Philippines, namely the Visayas and Mindanao, must undertake measures to cut the COVID-19 threat.
According to the IATF-EID, LGUs in the Visayas and Mindanao have the freedom on the implementation of community quarantines or lockdowns in their jurisdiction but using the guidelines by the IATF-EID.
The Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) also said that the LGUs in the Visayas and Mindanao have the flexibility in evaluating their lockdown with the help of the DOH.Here
are the several community quarantines outside Luzon:
Misamis Oriental Governor Yevgeny Emano ordered on March 24 a general community quarantine on the province until April 14, banning the entry of visitors and implementing a province-wide curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. the following day.

From May 1 to 15, the ECQ in Luzon became limited only to Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon (except Aurora province) and other areas deemed as high-risk for COVID-19.
It followed the usual ECQ rules as stated in Executive Order 112 by President Duterte.
The rest of Luzon was proclaimed to be under "general community quarantine" or GCQ where implementation of the quarantine is less strict.
Under GCQ, low-risk industries can let their employees work in phases as well as priority and vital projects in construction may continue with the guidance of the Department of Public Works and Highways.

Management ===
The IATF-EID for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases that was created through Executive Order No.
168 in 2014 convened in January 2020 to address the growing viral outbreak in Wuhan, China.
They made a resolution to manage the spreading of the new virus, which was known at the time as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and eventually renamed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19.
On March 9, 2020, President Duterte called the IATF-EID amidst the rising cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines.
Executive Secretary Medialdea issued a memorandum on March 16 regarding the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine of the entire Luzon addressing the heads of government agencies, offices and similar institutions as well as state universities and colleges and LGUs.
On the following day, the IATF-EID approved and adopted operational guidelines for the Luzon ECQ.
On March 18, Medialdea issued another memorandum about additional guidelines for the Luzon ECQ affirming the rules set by the IATF.On March 25, the IATF-EID revealed a National Action Plan (NAP) to slow down the spreading of COVID-19.
The NAP was created to effectively and efficiently implement and decentralize the system of managing the COVID-19 situation.
In addition, the IATF-EID created the COVID-19 National Task Force headed by Department of National Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, which handles the operational command.
At the same time, the IATF-EID became the "policy-making body of operations" while the National Incident Command administers the daily concerns and operations.

===
Mobilization ===
On the first day of the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine or ECQ, President Duterte declared the entire Philippines under a state of calamity for a period of six months "unless earlier lifted or extended as circumstances may warrant," in order for the LGUs to act swiftly on emergency circumstances through getting funds fast.
In addition, the President called all agencies that enforce the law, with the help of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, "to undertake all necessary measures to ensure peace and order in affected areas, as may be necessary."
He also ordered the freezing of price of basic goods, emergency medicines and medical supplies through a memorandum.
Agencies of the national government and the LGUs are responsible for making sure that prices are controlled.
Also on the first day of the ECQ, the DOH launched hotlines for COVID-19 emergencies.
The hotlines (02-894-COVID or 02-894-26843 and 1555) were made possible through the DOH's partnership with the DILG's National Emergency Hotline and the Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) as well as Smart Communications, PLDT's mobile subsidiary.
The numbers are available 24/7 throughout the Philippines.

===
Suspensions and extensions of deadlines ===
On March 18, 2020, the second day of the ECQ, Senate President Vicente Sotto III spoke to Department of Transportation (DOTr)
Secretary Arthur Tugade and proposed the extension of the renewal of expiring licenses of drivers and franchises of public transport due to the inconveniences brought about the implementation of the ECQ.
Tugade responded positively and directed the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to extend the deadline up to the end of April 2020.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue also lengthen the deadline for filing income tax returns (ITR) from the original April 15 date to May 15.
Nevertheless, the agency appealed to the public to file their ITR on the original April 15 date if they are already prepared, "in order to help the Duterte administration raise enough funds" for battling the economic impact of COVID-19.
BIR is expecting a shortfall of about Php 145 billion tax collections because of the new deadline.
On March 20, the fourth day of the ECQ, the DOTr announced that they will disallow the entry of foreigners to the Philippines in compliance with the order by the DFA to suspend visa issuance and visa-free privileges starting midnight of March 22.
Exceptions to this rule include "foreign spouses and children (provided that the foreign spouse and children are traveling with the Filipino national), foreign government and international organization officials accredited to the Philippines.
"
The Bureau of Immigration followed suit and applied the restrictions set by the DFA.

===
Granting of special powers to the President ===
President Duterte issued Proclamation No.
933 on March 21, calling the Philippine Congress to convene a special session to make a law that will authorize the President to execute necessary powers for handling the COVID-19 national emergency.
The House of the Representatives convened on March 23 and approved House Bill No.
6616, also known as the "We Heal as One Act of 2020," which took them fourteen hours to pass it.
The Philippine Senate passed Senate Bill 1418, a counterpart measure also known as "Bayanihan to Heal as One Act."
President Duterte signed the combined bills on March 24, putting it into law as Republic Act 11469, having the same short name as the Senate bill.
The law, which follows World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in combating the spread of COVID-19 throughout the country, gives the President thirty special powers that will last for three months unless modified by Congress.
In relation to the community quarantine, Republic Act 11469 grants the President to "immediately mobilize assistance in the provision of basic necessities to families and individuals affected by the community quarantine, especially indigents and their families.
"
Low-income families of about 18 million affected by the implementation of the Luzon ECQ and other areas affected the COVID-19 are set to receive Php 5,000 to Php 8,000 subsidy a month for two months.

Economic ===


====
General reactions ====
Congressman Joey Salceda who is an economist and the House of the Representatives Committee chairman on Ways and Means said that the Philippines could go into recession if there is no implementation of a community quarantine, although, he admitted that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect the economy of the Philippines in a negative way.
According to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno on March 18, 2020, the economic impact is still not known but "it will definitely have an impact.
"
Two days later, on March 20, 2020, the BSP said that the shutdown of Luzon will slow down the economy of the Philippines with a disruptive impact.
BSP further said the economic impact would last until the second half of 2020
but it is expected to rebound on 2021.

====
GDP, basic goods and economic growth ====
In other forecast, the domestic output estimates by economic managers for the year 2020 are from 0.3 to 1.0 percentage point.
The National Economic and Development Authority revised its 2020 economic growth forecast to 5.5 to 6.5 percent against the targeted 6.5 to 7.5 percent growth, assuming that the COVID-19 problem lasts until June 2020.
It is expected that the prices of basic goods will go up to 2.2 percent only compared to 2.5 percent average in 2019.
Nomura, a Japanese financial holding company, lowered its gross domestic product (GDP) estimates to the Philippines from 5.6% to 1.6%.
The analysts from the holding company further said that the estimates assume a scenario where the Luzon lockdown ends on the middle of April as scheduled.
When Congressman Salceda was interviewed by online stockbroker COL Financial, he said that in an optimistic scenario when the lockdown is very effective, flattens the curve, and provides a good stimulus, the GDP would rise to 3.3% in 2020 and 5.1% in 2021.
In a mediocre or reasonable case where the lockdown is a little successful, the GDP would increase to 2.9% in 2020 and 4.0% in 2021.
Lastly, in a pessimistic case where the economy is basically in recession, health emergency persists, and the lockdown is lengthen, there would be a −0.3% GDP in 2020 and 2.9% GDP in 2021.On March 6, 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) issued a publication summarizing the economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak as a whole on the developing countries in Asia, including the Philippines.
According to graphical representation presented by ADB in the publication, the GDP impact of the outbreak in the Philippines would be about between 0.0 and -0.5 percentage of the GDP in a best-case scenario while in a worst-case scenario, it would be around slightly near −0.5 percentage of the GDP with a hypothetical worst-case impact of about near −1.5 percentage of the GDP.
The publication also indicated that tourism and business travel are the important channels through which economies will be affected in developing countries of Asia as well as supply-side disruptions and economic effects in other important channels through health and health care.

Stock market and banks ===
=
After the two-day closure of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) due to the Luzon lockdown, the market crashed to about 24 percent reaching the 4,000 level, which is an eight-year low.
The PSE reopened after submitting a position paper to the IATF-EID, requesting to be exempted from the lockdown.
On April 1, about two weeks after the implementation of the lockdown, the PSE regained after the stock market made an upswing for two consecutive days due to the possibility of a more eased lockdown guidelines.
Banks remained open during ECQ providing their services through limited branches, skeletal workforce and shortened banking hours.
A number of banks lengthen and modified deadlines on payment dues to help those people who are affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

====
Workforce ====
ADB predicted that due to prolonged COVID-19 woes, there are at least 87,000 jobless Filipinos in a best-case scenario, while in a worst-case scenario, 252,000 Filipinos would lose their jobs.
Based on the data from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on March 23, 2020, there are 108,620 workers affected in the middle of the ECQ in Luzon, covering 2,317 establishments.
Only 889 companies implemented flexible work that affected 41,331 workers.
On the other hand, 600 companies closed down their business affecting 30,796 workers.
According to DOLE's report, the affected industries are tourism-related, restaurants, manufacturing and hotel.
On March 31, DOLE Secretary Silvestre Bello III said that the affected workers increased to more than 630,000, covering 15,213 establishments.
He added that 169,232 of those workers belong to the informal sector.
He pleaded the employers to register to the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP), the financial assistance program of the government that will benefit their affected workers.
The said financial assistance is separate from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and other agencies, which give cash aid to affected people under the Bayanihan to Heal As One act.

Entertainment and broadcast media ===


===
=
ABS-CBN ====
In a statement on March 13, 2020, ABS-CBN made public that the television network is halting the production of television series and the presentation of its live shows.
Reruns of previously aired teleseryes or Philippine television dramas (such as May Bukas Pa and
On the Wings of Love) replaced ongoing series (such as Ang Probinsyano and Make it With You).
ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programs continued to deliver live news on their television and radio stations.
On April 1, 2020, DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo aired on ANC and suspended regular programming on DZMM due to the exposure of their workers to persons under investigation for COVID-19.During the reimposition of the ECQ in the Greater Manila Area, studio programs such as
It's Showtime and Magandang Buhay suspended their live broadcast.

====
GMA Network ====
GMA Network also temporarily suspended its own television production due to the lockdown that affected their entertainment programming while blocktimers and co-producers adhered to community quarantine guidelines.
Reruns of concluded drama series (such as Ika-6 na Utos and the 2016 remake of Encantadia) replaced ongoing series (such as Prima Donnas and the Philippine adaptation of the 2016 Korean drama series Descendants of the Sun) that temporarily halted its production.
Some GMA shows (such as Magpakailanman and Sarap, 'Di Ba?)
were able to broadcast their pre-taped episodes during the first week of the ECQ.Upon
the declaration of the public health emergency, GMA banned live audiences on their variety shows (such as All-Out Sundays) and later aired reruns during the ECQ period.
Eat Bulaga!
,
a GMA blocktimer that airs live in APT Studios, was the first variety show that disallowed live audience.
With regards to its news and public affairs television programming, GMA Network's news organization arm, GMA News and Public Affairs, continued to air live news.
Its sister station, GMA News TV (now GTV as of February 22, 2021), went off air for a day at one point during the Luzon ECQ.
Their sister radio stations, Barangay LS 97.1 and Super Radyo DZBB, also continued to broadcast.

====
Other networks and entertainment companies ====
TV5 has also reorganized their television programming because of the ECQ.
On March 15, 2020, the Film Development Council of the Philippines ordered the stopping of the production of film, television and other audio-visual content during the community quarantine.
CNN Philippines stopped its operations for a moment on March 18 after a positive COVID-19 patient entered the building premises where their office is located.

===
Environmental ===
Data that were released on March 25, 2020 by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology (IESM) at the University of the Philippines Diliman, and Airtoday.ph indicate a better air quality in Metro Manila since the implementation of the Luzon ECQ on March 16.
PM2.5
(particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter) was significantly decreased.
At the same time, PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) emissions were reduced significantly due to lessened utilization of machines that crush and grind as well as low dust exposure from roads.
Because of lowered air pollution during the Luzon lockdown, previously hazy skies can be seen clearly in Metro Manila.
Some of the landscapes that are very visible in Metro Manila during the Luzon-wide lockdown include the Sierra Madre mountains and Mount Samat, which are rarely seen clearly due to smog.

=== Law and crime ===


====
Human rights violations ====
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) stated that arrests due to disobeying the ECQ guidelines must be done in accordance with the law as the agency receives complaints regarding arrests.
CHR spokesperson Jacqueline Ann de Guia noted that all arrests, including warrantless arrests, "must be strictly done within the legal standards inscribed in the law."
She also added that the Luzon quarantine is not martial law, which President Duterte also stressed, but a safety measure.
Department of Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra earlier said that the arrests due to resisting and disobeying quarantine rules falls under Republic Act 11332
(law on reporting of communicable diseases) as well as the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines.
Although, former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te opined that Republic Act 11332 is too broad to be a reason for the arrests.
There were reports of violations of human rights (including children's rights violations) as the government implements ECQ and human rights advocates had taken note of this.
Presidential spokesperson Roque who is a human rights lawyer himself said that the Philippine government does not allow human rights violations as LGUs implement ECQ rules.
He further made an assurance that the DILG "is committed to uphold human rights at all times and will not tolerate any violation during this period of ECQ."
Meanwhile, the CHR already investigated these human rights violations incidents.
Despite these human rights concerns, there are 86% of people surveyed by Gallup International, through its partner Philippine Survey and Research Center Inc., saying that they are willing to give up some of their human rights if those "sacrifices" would help stop the virus from spreading.
After more than a month of the implementation of the Luzon ECQ, on April 21, the Philippine National Police's (PNP) Chief Archie Gamboa said that they will right away perform arrests without warning to those who violate Luzon ECQ guidelines.
This statement came amidst a reported 136,517 cases of quarantine violators after 35 days of the implementation of the Luzon ECQ.
Human rights lawyers from the National Union of Peoples Lawyers (NUPL) reacted on Gamboa's statement; NUPL Secretary General Ephraim B. Cortez said that there is no particular law that makes someone a criminal for violating ECQ rules.
Another group of lawyers from the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) asked the PNP tor reconsider its position regarding arrests and FLAG
also said that arresting without warning "would mean disregarding the carefully calibrated general rule and exceptions in Rule 113 (of the Rules of Criminal Procedures that provides a person in authority to inform a person being arrested) and creating a new rule of arrests, which is not allowed in the Constitution.
"One fatal incident that happened during the implementation of ECQ rules was when a retired soldier named Winston Ragos was gunned down by a police officer in Quezon City on April 21 at a quarantine checkpoint for an ECQ violation.
Police Master Sergeant Daniel Florendo was charged with homicide for shooting Ragos.
The CHR earlier said that the agency is investigating the incident and reiterated that "strict measures, such as community lockdowns, were set during the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately save lives.
The agency was alarmed "when these measures trigger allegations of human rights violations and, worse, result in any loss of lives."

Crime rate ====
In Metro Manila, it was reported that crime rates went down by 65.4% during the first five days of the ECQ, from March 15 to 20, according to National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO).
The reason for the decrease was attributed to people staying at their homes as stated by NCRPO chief Police Major General Debold Sinas.
After 24 days of the ECQ, the crime rate dropped to 62% in Luzon according to the PNP.
Crimes in Luzon continued to decrease to 64.9% after 35 days of the ECQ, which is the biggest reduction recorded in Luzon.

===
Military diplomacy ===
One of the pronouncement made by President Duterte related to the Luzon-wide lockdown is implementing a ceasefire with the CPP-NPA (Communist Party of the Philippines-
New People's Army) rebels.
Presidential Spokesperson Panelo said that the ceasefire starts on March 19, 2020 and will end on April 15, 2020.
This is done for the forces of the state to focus its resources to stop the spread of the COVID-19.
He also urged the rebels to help the government on their efforts against the COVID-19 threat.
Jose Maria Sison, CPP's founding chairman, initially said that the CPP and NDFP (National Democratic Front of the Philippines) will study the ceasefire offer.
He later responded and said that the NDFP "is not assured and satisfied that the reciprocal unilateral ceasefires are based on national unity against COVID-19.
"
On March 25, 2020, the CPP declared a ceasefire with government troops from March 26 to April 15, 2020, citing a call from United Nations Secretary General António Guterres for a global ceasefire between warring parties during the pandemic.
The CPP later extended the ceasefire for a further 15 days on April 16.

===
Religious ===
In response to the prohibition of mass gatherings during the ECQ throughout Luzon, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) through its President, Archbishop Romulo Valles, said that the celebration of the Eucharist, other liturgical services and spiritual activities from every diocese under their jurisdiction have to be broadcast live through the internet, television or radio.
All activities for the Lenten season are also canceled.
Earlier during the Metro Manila partial lockdown, the Archdiocese of Manila through its Apostolic Administrator, Bishop Broderick Pabillo, already canceled the celebration of the Holy Mass with congregation and dispensed the faithful from attending it.
As early as February, the Members Church of God International, supervised by Bro.
Eli Soriano and Bro.
Daniel Razon, have taken the necessary measures to see to it that the brethren in the congregation are prepared and properly oriented of the consequences that the pandemic will bring.
Other Christian churches such as a Baptist church in Quezon City also broadcast their religious service via live streaming amidst the COVID-19 threat.
A spokesperson for Jehovah's Witnesses, Dean Jacek, said that they are also doing live streaming for their congregations.
In different circumstances, the Iglesia ni Cristo announced the absence of worship services at their chapels.
Instead, they advised their members to pray at home
and they have given them lessons or guides that will be read by the head of the household.
The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches (PCEC), an organization composed of Evangelical and Protestant church member organizations, announced the suspension of regular Sunday worship services and other regular activities for a month and instead held its services via internet and social media.
After consulting with the Ulama and Imam Association of the Philippines, and the Imam Council of the Philippines, the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos stated that religious activities are suspended and encouraged Filipino Muslims to pray and stay at home.
This is done to limit the result of the COVID-19's continuous spread, given that people had died in a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan, Metro Manila due to COVID-19.

Effectiveness ==


===
Based on the number of cases and fatality rate ===
According to the study by the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team of the University of the Philippines (UP) released on April 13, 2020, the implementation of the Luzon-wide ECQ has been effective to slowing down the spread of the coronavirus even if they predicted that there would be around 9,000 to 44,000 cases by the end of April 2020.
Using time-series analysis, the UP response team was able to estimate those possible cases through trends that came from the DOH data they gathered.
Greatly relying on the work being done on finding new cases is the key to evaluating the effectiveness of the ECQ.
Although, they added that the next courses of actions will not be solely dependent on the number of cases.
The effectiveness can also be determined by fatality rate, which is 5.38% and the reproduction number is 0.6398; with those figures as of April 10, the study declared that the ECQ has been effective.
Furthermore, the study provided a matrix for the LGUs that can be the basis of their decision on what quarantine methods they can use after the supposed end of the Luzon ECQ on April 30 for continued effectiveness.
There are four proposed courses of action namely no quarantine, general community quarantine, enhanced community quarantine, and extreme enhanced community quarantine that would be dependent on the probability of outbreak and the ratio of confirmed cases to estimated outbreak threshold.

===
Based on the implementation of travel restrictions ===
The San Miguel Corporation, which is one of co-operators of the expressways in the Philippines, said on April 3 that during the first 14 days of the Luzon lockdown, the volume of vehicles dropped to 80% in the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx).
However, on April 15, IATF spokesperson Nograles said that the number of private vehicles that ply over EDSA and other major thoroughfares got bigger after one month of the Luzon ECQ as the number of motorists defying the lockdown guidelines exceeded 108,000.
Because of this, the PNP's Highway Patrol Group implemented a stricter imposition of quarantine rules on checkpoints along the SLEx, EDSA and other highways.
Drivers of vehicles with non-essential business that are traveling on these roads were ticketed and their license confiscated.

===
Based on curfew, mass gatherings and social distancing rules ===
It was reported on April 2 that people violating curfew rules reached around 20,000 according to PNP.
Duterte warned the public that there would be martial law-like lockdown if people continues to disobey ECQ rules, specifically social distancing and curfew.
Some of those violations include crowded markets in Metro Manila and holding of cockfighting and boxing events.
In other quarantine rules, the imposition of window hours risked violating the social distancing guidelines since more people would go to the markets at the same time; thus, the DILG directed LGUs to discontinue observing the window hours (where people go out only on specific few hours during the day).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, cordons sanitaires and similar restrictions have been implemented in numerous countries and territories around the world.
These restrictions were established to reduce the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19.
By April 2020, about half of the world's population was under lockdown, with more than 3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments.
Although similar disease control measures have been used for hundreds of years, the scale seen in the 2020s is thought to be unprecedented.
Research and case studies have shown that lockdowns are effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted.
To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the WHO recommends a response to the pandemic that consists of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.
Countries and territories around the world have enforced lockdowns of varying stringency.
Some include total movement control while others have enforced restrictions based on time.
In many cases, only essential businesses are allowed to remain open.
Schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 63 countries, affecting approximately 47 percent of the world's student population.
Beginning with the first lockdown in China's Hubei province in January 2020 and the entirety of Italy in March, lockdowns continued to be implemented in many countries throughout 2020 and 2021.
On 24 March 2020, the entire 1.3 billion population of India was ordered to stay at home during its lockdown, making it the largest of the pandemic.
Pandemic restrictions have had social and economic impacts, and have been met with protests in some territories.

==
Efficacy ==
Several researchers, from modelling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns are effective at reducing the spread of, and deaths caused by, COVID-19.
Lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing COVID-19 community transmission, healthcare costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater stringency, and when not lifted too early.
A study investigating the spread based on studies of the most common symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in France, Italy and the UK showed a marked decrease in new symptoms just a few days after the start of confinement on the countries (Italy and France) with the strongest lockdowns.
Modelling on the United States pandemic suggested "the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier" and that the second wave would have been less severe had the lockdown lasted another two weeks.
The stringent lockdown in Hubei in early 2020 proved effective at controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
The relatively high number of cases and deaths in Sweden, which has kept much of its society open during the pandemic, when compared to its neighbors with comparable demographics Norway, Denmark and Finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to at least partly attributable to this difference in policy.
Similarly, modelling on Australian data concluded that achieving zero community transmission through a strict lockdown lowers healthcare and economic costs compared to less stringent measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early relaxation of restrictions have greater costs.
This "zero community transmission" approach was adopted in Australia, and a strict four month lockdown in the state of Victoria during an outbreak in Melbourne, combined with other measures, averted a wider outbreak in the country.
New Zealand and Vietnam's successful containment measures have included targeted lockdowns.

===
Voluntary versus mandatory restrictions ===
One study led by an economist at the University of Chicago found that involuntary lockdowns had little impact, with voluntary distancing making up nearly 90% of the fall in consumer traffic as people feared the virus itself.
Similarly, a NBER study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just 5–10%.
Another study from Yale University found that most social distancing was voluntary, driven primarily by "media coverage of morbidity and mortality.
"On
the other hand, some studies have argued that coercive measures probably decreased interactions, while accepting that most of the reduction may have been voluntary.
One of those two studies, by Flaxman et al.,
has been criticized, among other things for having a country-specific adjustment factor, without which the model would predict a massive number of deaths for Sweden.
One widely cited economic simulation asserting that shelter-in-place orders reduced total cases three-fold, however, held voluntary distancing constant.
Another study found a 30% difference among border-counties where stay-at-home orders were imposed.
Another study that compared the impact of 'less restrictive interventions' on the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden and South Korea, with mandatory stay-at home orders in 8 other countries, such as France and Spain, did not find evidence for greater disease control in the countries with more restrictions.
However, the findings of the study have been questioned due to its numerous limitations, including the small sample size of countries.
Some research has also found that an "advisory" approach is not adequate to control COVID-19 outbreaks.
An analysis of an outbreak in northern Italy found that an effective reduction in community transmission occurred during a strict national lockdown, and that earlier less stringent measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a level low enough to reduce the spread of COVID-19.Since
the beginning of the pandemic, Google has consistently collected data on movements, showing rapid declines in public activity long before legal restrictions were imposed.
An April poll found that 93% of Americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal restrictions.

== Reception ==
A review of 348 articles on non-pharmaceutical interventions concluded unanimously an acknowledgement of their importance in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
However, current research also acknowledges high societal costs.

===
Related to epidemiology ===
During the early stages of the pandemic in Europe and the United States, statistical modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a large number of deaths were used as the basis for lockdowns.
This includes an Imperial College projection, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson.
Despite some criticisms, academics defended the Imperial projection as fundamentally sound, while admitting the code was "a buggy mess.
"A notable opponent included Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who has frequently criticised lockdowns.
The Swedish government's strategy included minimal restrictions and has been controversial, in part due to the relatively high death toll due to widespread transmission.
However, the Swedish government began considering enacting a lockdown in early 2021.American global health physicians Ranu Dhillon and Abraar Karan have argued for "smarter lockdowns" which use granular epidemiological data to only impose restrictions on areas with high levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable populations in these locations to offset the economic costs.

===
Related to social impacts ===
Some commentators have suggested that states' use of emergency powers to curb freedom of assembly and movement are authoritarian and may result in long-term democratic backsliding.
Centralization of power by political leadership in Hungary, Poland, China and Cambodia in response to the pandemic have been cited as examples.
Some researchers have noted that pandemic restrictions have come with mental health costs.
UN Women warned in a April 2020 report that pandemic restrictions exacerbate gender inequalities and have led to an increase in domestic violence.
Many women are being forced to ‘lockdown’ at home with their abusers at the same time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.
For instance, in France there was a spike in cases of about 30% since the lockdown in March 2020.

===
Related to economic impacts ===
Economists generally supported increased government funding for mitigation efforts, even at the cost of tolerating a very large economic contraction.
They agreed that lockdowns should continue until the threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only the economic impact.
There was consensus, at least in some economic circles, that "severe lockdowns — including closing non-essential businesses and strict limitations on people's movement — are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less aggressive measures".

Both the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published statements noting the impact of the lockdowns on livelihoods and food security, and Dr David Nabarro, WHO Special Envoy on COVID-19 stated in October 2020 that "lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer".
===
Protests ===
There have also been a number of protests over responses to the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, some of which were specifically in opposition to lockdowns, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand.
The motivations for and sizes of these protests have varied.
Some have been spurred by the economic and social impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the pandemic, conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination.

==
Table of pandemic lockdowns ==
In the table pandemic lockdowns are defined as the shutdown of parts of the economy, due to non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures and are enforceable by law like:

Closing of schools and kindergartens
Closing of non-essential shops (shops and stores apart from food, doctors and drug stores)
Closing of non-essential production
Cancellation of recreational venues and closing of public places
Curfews
Stay-at-home orders and
total movement controlThese measures are considered to have caused the COVID-19 recession in 2020.

The table does not contain:

Measures with smaller economic impacts like:
border closures
social distancing measures and social movement restrictions
travel restrictions.

Other non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures like mandatory quarantines after travel, self quarantine and social distancing measures
Any measures which are voluntary rather than enforceable by lawThe pandemic has resulted in the largest number of shutdowns/lockdowns worldwide at the same time in history..
By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April – more than half of the world's population.
Restrictions first began in China, with other countries in East Asia like Vietnam soon following it in implementing widespread containment measures.
Much of Europe, North America and Africa took much longer to bring in tough measures.
Lockdowns between and within nations are of varying stringency.
By mid April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, around 100 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion were under lockdown in India; the largest of all lockdowns.
By the end of April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in various countries of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom; while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.

The situation of women in the world of work ====
Due to the pandemic, the employment situation of a big percentage of the population has changed.
A lot of people have lost their jobs or have had their salary and working hours reduced.
Moreover, most of the companies and their employees have had difficulties in adapting to teleworking.
The impact can be seen in a study made by the National University of Santiago del Estero, which reports how the Argentinean government's measures to stop the expansion of COVID-19 have affected society, focusing on the Social, Preventive and Compulsory Isolation, in the work context of Argentina and Mar de Plata.
Particularly, it analyses the situation in two sectors which are mainly occupied by women and which have been severely affected by the pandemic: domestic and unpaid care work.
This new reality has mainly affected women, as not only do they have to cope with their working hours (paid or unpaid), but they are also responsible for the care of dependent people, in most of the cases.
This situation is even worse when there are children living with them due to the closure of educational centers as a result of the pandemic.
Thus, the number of hours that women dedicate to household and care tasks has considerably increased .
A 43% of salaried women and 76% of unpaid women are doing these tasks right now (Actis Di Pasquale, Barboni, Florio, Ibarra, & Savino, 2020).
At the same time, this group tends to have precarious, irregular or even unpaid jobs.
The pandemic has also led to a wave of dismissals, more than half of which have been made in jobs occupied by women.
In addition, 65% of the jobs that were suspended during the quarantine belonged to women.
In the case of Mar de Plata, only 13.1% of women work in domestic service compared to 0.1% of men.
Moreover, at national level, approximately 90% of women report that they perform unpaid work at their houses (Actis di Pasquale, Barboni, Florio, Ibarra, & Sabino, 2020).
These data show both the high female presence in this area and the fact that the pandemic has particularly affected women's role in the world of work and in their households.

===
Australia ===
A number of Australian states, territories, and cities have implemented lockdowns in response to the pandemic.
The country entered a general nationwide lockdown on 23 March 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, which was lifted on 15 May.
The state of Victoria, particularly its capital city of Melbourne, the country's second most populous city with five million residents, entered an extended lockdown on 7 July 2020 in response to a rapidly growing community outbreak.
Initial measures included the closure of all non-essential services, including retail and gyms.
Hospitality establishments were permitted to open in take-away and delivery capacities only.
Schools and childcare facilities were also ordered to close.
Face coverings were made mandatory as of 23 July 2020, with a fine of $200 AUD for non-compliance to those above 12 years of age, although formal exemptions could be acquired.
Initially scheduled to last six weeks, restrictions were tightened further on 2 August after cases continued to grow, including a ban on travel further than a five kilometre radius from place of residence, a nighttime curfew of 8 PM to 5 AM, a one-hour limit on outdoor exercise, a one-person per day limit on shopping for essentials, and public gatherings limited to a maximum of two people.
Restrictions were progressively eased as the case rate declined, and were completely lifted on 28 October.
With a total duration of 112 days, the Victorian lockdown was the longest continuous period of COVID-19 lockdown globally as of October 2020.Brief "
snap lockdowns" in response to new clusters, particularly of the UK and South African strains, have been implemented at various times across the country, including in Adelaide (19–22 November), Sydney's Northern Beaches (19 December 2020 – 10 January 2021), Greater Brisbane (8–11 January and 29 March–1 April), Perth, Peel, and the South West (31 January–5 February), and across Victoria (13–17 February).
===
Cambodia ===
On April 15, 2021, Cambodia's government enacted a strict stay-at-home order across the entirety of Phnom Penh and Ta Khmau in response to the country's largest COVID-19 outbreak of the pandemic.
Certain districts were declared as "red zones", banning people from leaving their homes except for medical emergencies.
Sihanoukville also entered a lockdown on April 24.

===
Canada ===
On January 25, 2020, the first identified presumptive case in Canada was a 56-year-old male who had travelled to Wuhan, China, before returning to Toronto on 22 January.
Canada issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to China due to the outbreak, including a regional travel advisory to avoid all travel to the province of Hubei.

Federal health officials stated that the risk in Canada was low.

On January 26, 2020, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam tweeted, "There is no clear evidence that this virus is spread easily from person to person.
The risk to Canadians remains low.
"Three days later, on January 29, Dr. Tam told Canadians that "It's going to be rare, but we are expecting cases.
"On
February 1, the position of the prime minister and the administration remained that it would be discriminatory to exclude travellers from China, the source (and, at the time, still the epicentre) of the disease.
During March, Canadian provinces implemented lockdowns in response to COVID-19.

Ontario, the country's most populous province, had its first provincewide lockdown starting on December 26, 2020.
The lockdown was strengthened with a stay-at-home order effective January 14, 2021, and reopened on a regional basis starting February 10.
As a result of the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the province caused by COVID-19 variants, the government of Ontario once again announced a four-week provincewide shutdown effective April 3.
This shutdown was once again strengthened with another 28-day stay-at-home order starting April 8, in order to quickly combat the urgent crisis in the province's hospital capacity being caused by the variants.

===
China ===
China was the first country to enforce the quarantine and lockdown of cities and later whole provinces in late January.
Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said he personally authorized the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning on 23 January.
Although such measures are a very old tool of epidemic control, their use at the scale of a large city such as Wuhan or the even larger scale of provinces was controversial among experts at the time, with questions about their effectiveness and their ethics.
Some public health experts, while not always condemning the measure, raised the issue of the inevitable psychological toll such measures would have.
An ex-World Health Organization (WHO) official who headed the organization's Western Pacific Region during the SARS outbreak said that "the containment of a city [hadn't] been done in the history of international public health policy".
The WHO called the decision to quarantine Wuhan "new to science".
By early April, all lockdowns had ended or relaxed to a certain degree as the cases started to dwindle and the outbreak had come under control.
===
Fiji ===
On 19 March 2020, Fiji confirmed its first case in Lautoka.
In response, the Government of Fiji ordered the lockdown of the city on 20 March with closures of all schools and non-essential services all over the country.
On 3 April 2020, Fiji's capital, Suva, went into lockdown after confirming two new cases.
More than 300,000 residents were confined to their homes and all non-essential services in the city was closed for two weeks.
On 19 April 2021, Nadi and Lautoka went into lockdown after recording its first community transmission in one year.

===
France ===
From 17 March 2020, all people in France were required to complete and carry an exemption form to leave their homes and can be fined for non-essential journeys.
Essential journeys include shopping for food, travelling to and from work, accessing healthcare, and exercising within 1 km of the home for up to 1 hour.
Police around the country had set up road blocks to check people who were out and about had good reason and that their exemption declarations were in order.
These measures were lifted on 11 May 2020, with remaining restrictions on travel further than 100 km away from one's residence.
The latter restrictions were lifted on 2 June 2020.

On 28 October, president Emmanuel Macron announced a second lockdown until at least 1 December 2020.
During this second lockdown, schools remain open and more industries can keep operating (construction, public services...).
Like the first lockdown, citizens need to sign their certificates to can go around within 1 km up to hour per day.
Fines are 135 euros the 1st time, 200 euros for 2 times within 15 days and 3750 euros and 6 months jail sentence for 3 times within 30 days.

Italy ===
On 9 March 2020, the government of Italy under Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a national quarantine, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances, in response to the growing pandemic of COVID-19 in the country.
Additional lockdown restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses.
This followed a restriction announced on the previous day which affected sixteen million people in the whole region of Lombardy and in fourteen largely-neighbouring provinces in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont and Marche, and prior to that a smaller-scale lockdown of ten municipalities in the province of Lodi and one in the province of Padua that had begun in late February.
The restrictions were loosened in May 2020.

The lockdown measures, despite being widely approved by the public opinion, were also described as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the republic.
Nevertheless, Article 16 of the Constitution states that travel restrictions may be established for reasons of health or security.

===
Malaysia ===
Malaysia introduced the nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020, which was initially announced to last to 14 April but was extended several times.
The MCO prohibited mass gatherings, movement within the country, and most industries and all education institutions were ordered to close.
Extended Movement Control Orders (EMCO) were implemented in areas where suspected superspreading events or widespread transmission had occurred.
Royal Malaysian Police were mobilized to enforce restrictions.
These restrictions were later eased under the "Conditional MCO" (CMCO), which maintained some restrictions on assembly and movement but allowed some sectors to reopen which was later further relaxed to the "Recovery MCO" (RMCO) nationwide.
Localized CMCOs restrictions were introduced in the states of Sabah and Selangor were later introduced in response to outbreaks in those states.
The MCO was reinstated nationwide in January 2021.

===
Myanmar ===
In September 2020, Myanmar introduced a strict stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire for the entirety of the country's largest city Yangon amid a major local outbreak.
All non-essential businesses were ordered to close.
The city's 4 million residents were given less than 24 hours notice before the lockdown came into effect.

United Kingdom ===
Health in the UK is devolved to each of the four nations, and lockdown is decided by each government separately (the UK Government acting on behalf of England only).

The initial announcement, however, was done by Boris Johnson, with agreement from the other three heads of government.
At 8:30 p.m. on 23 March 2020, Boris Johnson announced a stay-at-home order effective immediately, though only legally effective from 1:00 p.m. on 26 March 2020, through The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions)
(England) Regulations 2020.
The slogan "Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" was used in England.
All non-essential shops and services were ordered to close, throughout the UK and police were granted powers to issue fines, send people home, especially persons suspected of being infected, and to break up gatherings of more than two people.
The British population was instructed to stay home, except for exercise once a day (such as running, walking or cycling), shopping for essential items, any medical need, providing care to a vulnerable person, or travelling to work where the work in question was vital and could not be done from home.
Johnson stated that the stay-at-home order would be reviewed every three weeks.
Working with general practitioners, the four NHS bodies strongly advised (though did not mandate) that those at the highest risk of severe complications from COVID-19 follow special shielding measures.
These included not leaving their home at all, even for essential reasons, and keeping two meters apart from other household members.

On 11 May, following the initial lockdown announcement, the UK-wide rules fractured and separate rules were announced at various times by the four governments of the United Kingdom:


====
Wales ====
On 26 March the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Wales)
Regulations 2020 were approved by the Welsh Parliament, giving the Welsh Government emergency powers to deal with various aspects of managing the pandemic.
These new powers include the authority to:
Take people into or keep them in quarantine
Restrict or prohibit mass gatherings
Close premises"Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives"
slogan rejected and "Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" was used.
On 23 October, Wales commenced a partial lockdown.

On 26 March, Snowdon and other Welsh mountains were closed to the public, after a larger number of English tourists had gathered on the mountains in the preceding days, causing traffic mayhem.
Natural Resources Wales later announced that all sites and paths liable to have large amounts of people visiting, or pose a high risk, would be closed.

By 27 March, North Wales Police were patrolling the border between Wales and England because visitors were ignoring the stay-at-home instructions and travelling into Wales.
In many cases the police were stopping cars entering from England; such border control had not happened between Wales and England since the 16th century.
On 8 May, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that the COVID-19 lockdown in Wales would be extended for a further three weeks.
He also announced "modest" changes to the measures already in force: some garden centres would be allowed to re-open, and people could now exercise outdoors more than once per day provided that they "stay
local".
On 3 June, Welsh Government briefings began (later referred to as 'press conferences') in a series that was set up by Welsh Government as a way of dispersing new information to the people of Wales regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales.
These were placed on a CC-BY-SA open licence.

Restrictions were further eased by an announcement on 31 July, confirming that pubs and restaurants would be able to open indoor areas on 3 August.
Up to thirty people would be able to meet outdoors and children under 11 would no longer have to keep a 2-metre (6') distance from anyone.
Indoor bowling alleys, auction houses and bingo halls were allowed to reopen, while swimming pools, gyms, leisure centres and indoor play areas would be allowed to reopen from 10 August, all with social distancing.
Towards the end of August, concerns grew about a potential second spike in infections, after passengers arriving at Cardiff Airport from overseas tested positive for the virus.
The flight operator, TUI Group, was criticised for failing to enforce mask-wearing during the flight.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething later revealed that 30 cases had been linked to four flights into the UK from the island of Zante, and the Welsh and Scottish governments lobbied the UK government to have the island included in the list of quarantine destinations for the UK as a whole.
On 19 October, the Welsh Government announced that a second national lockdown, described as a "fire-break", would be imposed from 23 October until 9 November, coinciding with school half-term holidays which would be extended by a week in colleges and for school students in year 9 (13 to 14 years old) and above, in the hope of bringing down the number of coronavirus cases.
The First Minister announced that all pubs, restaurants, and non-essential shops would be closed during that period.

Announced on 16 December, the Welsh Government planned to go into a full lockdown immediately after the 5-day Christmas period (23-27 December) on 28 December.
However, on 19 December 2020, it was announced that Wales would go into a full lockdown immediately at midnight on 20 December.
The circumstance for the latest lockdown was reviewed every three weeks, but no end date has been announced.
After the firebreak, rules were standardised across Wales with localised restrictions abolished.
From 9 November, pubs, restaurants and cafes reopened with groups of up to four people (children under eleven not counting in the total) from different households allowed to meet up in them; the 10pm curfew for alcohol sales remained in place.
Non essential shops also reopened.
Two households could form a bubble (interact when they wished) whilst any number of children under eleven and up to 15 or 30 individuals over that age could take part in indoor and outdoor organised events respectively.
Travel restrictions within Wales were lifted though non essential visits to other parts of the UK or abroad remained banned.
On 19 December, The First Minister announced that the whole of Wales will enter tier-4 restrictions.
This includes an ongoing national lockdown from that evening.
This follows an outbreak of a mutant strain of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.
Original joint plans of relaxed restrictions from 23 to 28 December were in place for the entire United Kingdom, but this was amended so that the sole relaxed period would consist of Christmas Day, in which only  two households will be allowed to meet.
Before and after Christmas Day, meeting with people from different households, will not be allowed to take place indoors.
Those that do meet with other households outdoors must stay at least 2 meters apart from each other and wear PPE.

On 11 May, in a national address to Scotland on the beginning of the seventh week of lockdown, Nicola Sturgeon asked the nation "to stick with lockdown for a bit longer - so that we can consolidate our progress, not jeopardise it[…] I won't risk unnecessary deaths by acting rashly or prematurely."

On 21 May First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlined a four-phase "route map" for easing lockdown restrictions in Scotland that included allowing people to meet up outside with people from one other household in the first phase.
The lockdown would be eased from 28 May subject to the number of new cases of COVID-19 continuing to fall.

====
England ====
The April lockdown left a significant impact on the economy, resulting in shrinking it by a fifth, i.e. 20%.
The "circuit-breaker" lockdown, which is expected to be relatively less intense could hit the economy by 5% or more.
As per Capital Economics, the estimated time required for the economy to get back to the pre-pandemic levels is a year to 2023.The slogan changed to "Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives" and those who could not work from home, including specifically construction and manufacturing workers, were encouraged to return to work albeit avoiding the use of public transport.
Additionally, the once-a-day limit on exercise was lifted.
The COVID-19 threat level system was introduced, and the "Stay Home" phase was announced to be equivalent to Level 4 (where 1 meant "COVID-19 is not known to be present in the UK", and 5 meant "The circulation of COVID-19 is high and rising exponentially
and there is a material risk of healthcare being overwhelmed").

On 13 May,  those in England were allowed to meet one other person not from their household outside whilst maintaining a 2-metre social distance, and from 28 May groups of up to six from different households were allowed to meet outside, keeping a safe distance.

From 1 June, English primary schools were encouraged to re-open to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, and
extremely vulnerable people shielding at home were advised it was safe to go outside for once-daily, socially-distanced exercise, for the first time in approximately two months.

From 15 June, non-essential retail reopened, and English secondary schools were asked to prepare to provide Year 10 and Year 12 students with some face-to-face meetings to support their home learning for essential upcoming exams the next year.
It also became mandatory to wear face coverings in healthcare settings and on public transport.

From 4 July, most other businesses were allowed to reopen, except for those considered to pose the highest risk such as indoor gyms, and social gathering rules were relaxed further.
Most notably, the two-meter rule was relaxed to one meter apart, where other mitigations such as face coverings were being used.
The only legal measure that remained, except for face coverings on public transport and in healthcare, was an upper legal limit of 30 on gatherings (except in 'local lockdown' areas, see below), but people were advised to limit gatherings to either two households in any indoor or outdoor, public or private setting, or to a maximum of six, outdoors only, when people gathering were from more than two households.

From 24 July, it became mandatory in England to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets.
By 15 August, most other businesses, including indoor theatres, casinos and bowling alleys, had been allowed to reopen.
Nightclubs and sexual entertainment venues, however, remained closed.

Schools reopened full-time from September, and from 9 September, the slogan changed once more, to "Hands, Face, Space" reminding the public to wash or sanitize hands often, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and keep a space of one meter or more from others, as well as letting fresh air in at public spaces
On 16 October, Northern Ireland commenced a partial lockdown.
Starting on 17 October, the government announced that London, among other areas, would move to Tier 2 restrictions, following a spike in cases, banning people from mixing indoors
privately.7  days after the lockdown in Wales, on 31 October, it was announced that a partial lockdown would commence in England from 5 November 2020, to last for 4 weeks up to and including 2 December.
Through the month of November, mass asymptomatic testing brought the case rate in Liverpool down enough for it to move down from Tier 3 into Tier 2.

After that, a new tiered approach was put into place, to be reviewed on 16 December (with any changes coming into force three days later).
For 5 days over the Christmas period (23–27 December), these restrictions are to be relaxed, allowing for three households to meet and form a protective "bubble" during this time period.
However this was not the case for residents in and around London as a fourth tier was introduced to combat rising cases.

On 4 January 2021, all four Chief Medical Officers and the NHS England Medical Director recommended that the COVID Alert Level should be increased, from level 4 to level 5, indicating that there was a material risk of healthcare services becoming overwhelmed.
On that day, Nicola Sturgeon announced a lockdown in Scotland which took effect at midnight.
Later that day, Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown in England, which took legal effect at 00:01 on 5 January.
On 22 February 2021, the UK Government published its 4-step plan to ease lockdown restrictions in England.

Countries and territories without lockdowns ==
Almost all countries and territories affected with COVID-19 have introduced and enforced some form of lockdown.
However, a few exceptions include South Korea and Taiwan, which rapidly and consistently implemented highly organized mass testing, contact tracing, public messaging and selective quarantining to identify and isolate outbreaks.
Korea's K-Quarantine system has been highly effective at bringing the pandemic under control.
Another exception in Asia is Japan.
Authorities in Tokyo have advised businesses to close and for the population to stay at home, but do not have legal authority to enforce a lockdown or penalise non-compliance.
Compliance with advice has nevertheless been high.
In the European Union, the sole nation not following this strategy is Sweden.
Measures in Sweden included the closing of universities and high schools and asking older and at-risk residents to avoid social contact, while keeping restaurants, primary schools and kindergartens open.
However, in early 2021 new laws permitting lockdown were enacted and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven warned that a lockdown was being considered.
Some of the few countries that did not enact lockdowns during 2020 were forced to later in the pandemic.
In Malawi, a proposed lockdown by the government was delayed by the High Court throughout 2020, until a state of emergency was declared and the country entered a lockdown in January 2021 in response to a worsening outbreak.
Although Cambodia restricted movement within the country during a period in 2020, it introduced its first major restrictions, including a curfew and later stay-at-home order across capital city Phnom Penh, during its largest outbreak to date in early 2021.
East Timor also enacted its first lockdown of capital city Dili in March 2021.In
the United States and Brazil, a handful of states have not introduced any lockdown-type measures (commonly known as "stay-at-home orders").

The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus.
Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March, and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.
Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020, and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.
Social distancing rules were imposed on 21 March, and state governments started to close "non-essential" services.
"
Non-essential services" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.
The number of new cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March, and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month.
A second wave of infections emerged in Victoria during May and June, which was attributed to an outbreak at a Melbourne quarantine hotel.
The second wave, though largely localised to Melbourne, was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at its peak, the state had over 7,000 active cases.
Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown which eventually lasted almost four months.
The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October.
As of 29 April 2021, Australia has reported 29,779 cases, 25,486+ recoveries, and 910 deaths, with Victoria's second wave accounting for nearly 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of fatalities.
No deaths from COVID-19 were recorded in Australia from 28 December 2020 until 13 April 2021, when one death occurred in Queensland.
There has been one death linked to an adverse vaccination reaction.
On 15 April 2021, a 48-year-old New South Wales woman died in John Hunter Hospital after developing thrombosis (blood clot) with thrombocytopenia (abnormally low levels of platelets)
four days after being vaccinated on 8 April with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine.
By 23 April 2021
there had been 6 cases in Australia of blood clotting in people after they received Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccinations.
Long-haul flying is still a greater risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) than COVID-19 vaccinations.
The stated goal of the National Cabinet is "suppression", as opposed to "elimination", meaning continually trying to drive community transmission to zero but expecting that new outbreaks may occur.
This is in contrast to the mitigation strategies implemented by most other nations.
Compared to other Western countries, notably the United States and European countries, Australia's handling has been praised for its effectiveness.
Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; rapid recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce during March 2020; comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the US  and later on, the use of short intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.
Although Australia's efforts to develop a bluetooth-based contact tracing app were not particularly effective, QR code based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia's businesses.
These apps, which are effectively required by State Governments, give government health departments the ability to reconstruct the presence of anyone visiting bars or restaurants, generally for 28 days after the visit.
The nationwide vaccination program began with the first doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine being administered in Sydney on Sunday 21 February 2021.

==
Background ==
A novel coronavirus that caused a respiratory illness was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, which confirmed its concern on 12 January 2020.
WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March.
The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower than that of SARS, a related disease which emerged in 2002, but its transmission has been significantly greater, leading to a much greater total death toll.
The widespread reporting of the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season in major media and social media around the world caused a significant drop in the number of tourists coming to Australia, including those from China.
The absence of tourist arrivals during this time could have played a significant role in sparing Australia from the spread of COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic.
This is in contrast to other major cities in Europe and North America, where the early spread of the virus continued undetected until late February 2020 or early March 2020.

Preventive measures ==


===
Travel restrictions ===
On 1 February 2020, Australia banned the entry of foreign nationals who had been in mainland China, and ordered its own returning citizens who had been in China to self-quarantine for 14 days.
The country also began to assess the relative risk of reflected transmission through third countries, and to ask travelers arriving from higher-risk countries to monitor for symptoms.
Australia subsequently imposed bans on Iran (1 March), South Korea (5 March), and Italy (11 March).
From 16 March, all travellers arriving in or returning to Australia were required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Failure to self-isolate could result in a fine of A$11,000 to A$50,000 and a possible prison sentence, depending on the state.
Cruise ships were also barred from docking in the country for 30 days.
On 20 March, Australia closed its borders to all non-residents and non-Australian citizens.
With limited exceptions, a ban was imposed on Australians travelling overseas.
By late March 2020, 62% of Australia's more than 3,000 coronavirus cases were among people who had returned from overseas.
From then, Australians returning from overseas were subject to two weeks compulsory quarantine in hotels.
The New South Wales quarantine program was helped by 150 Australian Defence Force personnel, including 30 who were stationed at hotels.
In Victoria, three private security operators were contracted to provide the security, while the other states and territories used their police resources.
The states and territories carried the costs of hotel quarantine.
By 19 June, since the policy came into force 81,000 people had entered Australia.
Of those, 63,000 had undergone hotel quarantine, while the rest, including flight crews, international businesspeople and defence members, fell under different rules.
Hotel quarantine had cost $118 million as at 19 June.
Interstate border closures began on 19 March, with Tasmania imposing a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all "non-essential" travellers to the state, including returning residents.
On 24 March, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory closed their borders, with all interstate arrivals being required to self-isolate for 14 days.
On 11 April, Queensland banned interstate arrivals, with only Queensland residents and those granted 'exemption' being allowed entry.
On 8 July, the Victorian and NSW governments, jointly closed their common border, following a large spike in cases in parts of Melbourne.
With the spike in coronavirus infections in Victoria linked to the hotel quarantine program, a judicial inquiry into the program in Victoria was called on 2 July; and all international arrivals into Melbourne were suspended.
On 9 July, other state and territory leaders agreed to reduce flights and arrivals into Australia from 8,000 to 4,000 a week to ease the burden on the hotel quarantine system.
States started to charge travellers for hotel quarantine.
In mid September, the states agreed to increased the number of arrivals to 6,000 a week, to help in the repatriation of tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas.
By 15 December 2020, 39,000 Australians were registered with the government as stranded, with more unregistered (as the government advised registration only for those needing assistance to return).
After repeated flight cancellations and without access to government-provided health care or welfare benefits, many families reported being forced to overstay visas, and burn down savings and incur debt to pay for accommodations.
Having to pay thousands of dollars for return tickets and mandatory hotel quarantine, some chose to send one family member back in order to resume work and earn enough money to pay the way of the rest.
Between 13 March and 15 July 2020, more than 357,000 people returned to Australia.
As of 15 January 2021 over 37,000 Australians were stranded abroad.
On 29 January 2021, the ability of Australians stuck overseas to return was further hampered when the UK banned direct flights from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the possible spread of the South African COVID-19 variant.
Both Etihad and Emirates airlines are UAE based.
An overnight curfew was introduced in Victoria on 2 August 2020, extended on 13 September and suspended on 27 September.
A Supreme Court judge has ruled the curfew was legal.

2021On
25 January 2021, Health Minister Greg Hunt suspended Australia's travel bubble with New Zealand for a period of 72 hours after New Zealand authorities confirmed a community transmission case in the country's Northland Region.
On 28 January the suspension of the travel bubble was extended for 3 more days.
On 5 February 2021, National Cabinet decided to increase the number of international passenger arrivals to Australia as from mid-February.
New South Wales will return to a weekly cap of 3,010 people and Queensland to 1,000.
South Australia has increased by 40 people a week to 530, and Victoria by almost 200 to 1,310.
Western Australia will remain at a reduced arrival cap.
The total national weekly cap of 4,100 will increase to approximately 6,300.On 11 February 2021, the airline Cathay Pacific decided that, excepting Sydney, from 20 February it would cease all flights to Australia until the end of the month.
This was in response to the Hong Kong government's new COVID rules requiring Hong Kong based aircrew to quarantine for 14 days on return to HK.On
24 February,
Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria suspended their travel bubble arrangements with New Zealand in response to a recent community outbreak in South Auckland.
As a result, New Zealanders traveling to these states would have to enter quarantine.
On 2 March 2021, the general closure of Australia's international borders to travel was extended another 3 months to 17 June 2021.
Australia's borders have now already been closed for 12 months.
The border could reopen earlier if the closure was "no longer needed."
Despite the border closure, between 25 March and 31 December 2020 over 105,000 exemptions were approved for people to leave Australia.
By April 2021, there were still about 40,000 Australians stranded overseas by the high cost of plane tickets and the cap on the number of people in the quarantine system, which was criticized for special treatment of sportspeople and celebrities.
Australia was chastised by the UN Human Rights Committee, which requested a prompt return for the country's citizens; the government has given out A$29 million to about 3,900 stranded people as a last resort, and operated 28 repatriation flights.
On 23 April, Prime Minister Morrison announced that travellers to Australia from "high risk" countries, in particular India, were to be reduced by 30 percent.
This decision was based on an increase in positive results for COVID-19 among travellers from India at the Howard Springs, Northern Territory quarantine facility.
Travel to such countries was also to be limited.
On 27 April, due to the "record breaking" outbreak of COVID-19 in India, with 323,000 new infections that day after five days with new cases peaking above 350,000, and another 2,771 COVID deaths there, the Federal Government "paused" all incoming flights from India until
at least 15 May. The pause includes repatriation flights into the Howard Springs quarantine facility near Darwin with more than 9,000 Australians in India at this date wanting to come to Australia.
===
National Cabinet ===
On 13 March 2020, the National Cabinet, a form of national crisis cabinet akin to a war cabinet, was created following a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).
This is the first time such a cabinet has been proclaimed since World War II, and the only time in Australian history that a crisis cabinet has included state and territory leaders.
The cabinet consists of the premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories and meets weekly during the crisis.
At its first meeting on 13 March, the National Cabinet announced that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled from 15 March.
Schools, universities, workplaces, public transport and airports were not included in this recommendation.
Prime Minister Morrison also announced that he intended to attend a Rugby League match on 14 March; "I do still plan to go to the football on Saturday" but later decided against attending the match.

On 29 March, the Cabinet agreed to stricter limits to apply from midnight on 30 March: a limit on both indoor and outdoor gatherings of two people except weddings (5) funerals (10) and people of the same household or family; strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for necessary shopping, health care, exercise, and work and study that can't be done remotely; public playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms to be closed.
It was left to individual states to enforce these guidelines.
They also agreed to a moratorium on evictions for six months for both commercial and residential tenancies suffering financial distress.
On 2 April 2020, the Federal government announced the temporary provision of free childcare so that people could continue working, and to prevent closure of childcare centres.
The Government paid half each centre's operating costs.
The free childcare ended on 12 July, and the previous Child Care Subsidy was reintroduced.

===
Human biosecurity emergency declaration ===
On 18 March 2020, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, after a National Security Committee meeting the previous day.
The Biosecurity Act 2015 specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency exists if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that "a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale".
This gives the minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations.
The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential)
Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act.
The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, made by the Health Minister on the same day, forbids international cruise ships from entering Australian ports before 15 April 2020.A social distancing rule of four square metres (43 sq ft) per person in any enclosed space was agreed by National Cabinet on 20 March, to be implemented through State and Territory laws.
On 22 March 2020, the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria imposed a mandatory closure of non-essential services, while the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia imposed border closures.
On 22 March, Morrison announced a closure of places of social gathering, including registered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and bars, entertainment venues, including but not restricted to cinemas, casinos and nightclubs and places of worship.
Cafes and restaurants could remain open, but were limited to only takeaway food.
Similarly, enclosed spaces for funerals and things of that nature will have to follow the strict four-square-metre rule.
These measures (labelled stage 1 in anticipation of possible future measures) were effective immediately at midday, 23 March.
Morrison stated that he would like schools to remain open, but parents could keep children at home if they wished to.
On 25 March 2020, the Health Minister made a second determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015,
the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, which "forbids Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australian territory by air or sea as a passenger".
On the same day, the Prime Minister announced a further set of restrictions, labelled stage 2 restrictions, effective midnight that night.
These involved mainly smaller businesses, such as nail salons and tattoo parlours, while some, such as personal training sessions, were limited to 10 people.
At the same time, other gatherings were restricted, such as weddings (5 people) and funerals (10 people).At 12:00 am on Tuesday 31 March, restrictions were announced on indoor and outdoor gatherings, which were called stage 3 by the media, although the label "stage 3" was not part of the official announcement.
The new rule limited gatherings to two people, although it did not apply to members of the same household.
On 14 April the Federal government announced the "COVIDSafe" digital contact tracing app.
On 25 April 2020, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—
Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, made under subsection 477(1) of the Act, was signed into law by the Health Minister.
The purpose of the new legislation is "to make contact tracing faster and more effective by encouraging public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe", COVIDSafe being the new mobile app created for the purpose.
The function of the app is to record contact between any two people who both have the app on their phones when they come within 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) of each other.
The encrypted data would remain on the phone for 21 days of not encountering a person logged with confirmed COVID-19.On 3 September 2020, the human biosecurity emergency period under the Biosecurity Act 2015 was extended until 17 December.

===
National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board ===
On 25 March, the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) was established by the Prime Minister as a strategic advisory body for the national response to the pandemic.
(
On 27 July 2020, the Prime Minister renamed the organisation to the "National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board" (NCC).)
The NCC's role includes providing advice on public-private partnerships and coordination to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic.
On 29 March, Prime Minister Morrison announced in a press conference following a National Cabinet meeting that public gatherings will be limited to two people, while also urging Australians over the age of 70, Australians with chronic illness over the age of 60 and Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 to stay home and self-isolate.
Morrison also clarified that there were only four acceptable reasons for Australians to leave their houses: shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes.

===
Vaccines ===
Australia's first human trials of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, Novavax's NVX-CoV2373, began in Melbourne by 26
May
2020.The Australian government entered into agreements with Pfizer/BioNTech, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax and the University of Queensland for the supply of vaccines.
The University of Queensland vaccine was abandoned in December 2020 after trials revealed that, while it was safe, it triggered false positives on HIV tests.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine in January 2021.
The Australian government ordered 10 million doses, with the first 80,000 to be delivered in February 2021, but production problems and the imposition of export controls by the European Union to deliveries to countries outside Europe made meeting the delivery schedule problematic.
This would also affect deliveries of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was provisionally approved by the TGA in February, and received final approval in March.
Orders were reduced from 3.8 million to 1.2 million doses of this vaccine, which is manufactured in Belgium, and arrival was pushed back to March 2021.
CSL Limited began manufacturing 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Melbourne in November 2020.
Deliveries were expected to commence in March.
The AstraZeneca vaccine could be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures of 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F), whereas the Pfizer vaccine required storage at −70 °C (−94 °F).
However, concerns were raised about the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology called for a pause in its rollout, as the efficacy of the vaccine reported by trials was insufficient to achieve the desired herd immunity effect.
CSL management declined an invitation to appear before an Australian Senate inquiry.
Although the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, said that Australia would be "at the front of the queue", and the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, claimed that Australia would be among the first countries to receive COVID-19 vaccines, 61 other countries had already commenced vaccinating their citizens by the end of January 2021, while the Australian vaccination rollout was not scheduled to commence for another month.
On 15 February 2021, 142,000 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Australia.
The first doses are due be administered on 22 February.
The world-wide distribution of the vaccine has been described as "… the largest logistics effort in the world since World War" by Dr Roberto Perez-Franco of the Deakin University's Centre for Supply Chain and Logistics.
This was followed, on 28 February, by 300,000 doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which arrived at Sydney airport.
It was planned that most Australians will be immunised with this vaccine, the majority of which will be manufactured in Australia by CSL Limited.

On 5 March, Italy and the European Union blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of the Oxford−AstraZeneca vaccine from Italy to Australia, citing low COVID-19 case numbers in Australia and the limited availability of vaccines in the EU.Local manufacturing began in November 2020.
On 16 February, the first vials of COVID-19 vaccine produced in Australia came off the production line at the CSL Behring plant in Broadmeadows, Melbourne.
This is the active raw vaccine material.
The vaccine vials are filled and packaged into doses by Seqirus, a CSL subsidiary in Parkville, Melbourne.
Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia received its final approval from the TGA on 21 March.
Understandably, many front line health care workers preferred the Pfizer vaccine over the AstraZeneca one.
The Australian government had also signed a deal with Novavax for 51 million doses of its vaccine, with supply originally slated for "mid-2021".
As of April 2021, it had yet to be approved by the TGA.
It is not manufactured in Australia, so like the other imported vaccines, its availability was uncertain.
In trials it was reported to be 95.6 per cent effective against COVID-19, and an 86.3 per cent effective against the variant identified in the UK.In a February 2021 pre-budget submission, the Australian Academy of Science renewed its call for the government to develop the capability to produce MRNA vaccine technology in Australia.
The ability to mass-produce such vaccines onshore would insulate Australia against supply shocks, and cater for future pandemics and potential  biosecurity situations.
The MRNA vaccines had proved to be more effective than those produced with conventional vaccine technology, and easier to reconfigure to cater for new virus variants.

===
Vaccinations ===
The first public COVID-19 vaccination in Australia, with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, took place on 21 February 2021 in Sydney.
An 84-year-old aged care resident was the first Australian to receive the vaccine.
Prime Minister Morrison and Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly also received vaccinations.
The first Australian to receive the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was a doctor in regional South Australia on 5 March 2021 at Murray Bridge Hospital.

Adverse reactionsThe
first death in Australia linked to an adverse vaccination reaction occurred on 15 April 2021.
A diabetic 48-year-old New South Wales woman died in John Hunter Hospital after developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 4 days after being vaccinated on 8 April with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.
The TGA said it was "likely" her death was linked to the vaccination.
There were 2 previous cases in Australia of blood clotting linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.
By 23 April 2021, 3 more cases of blood clotting were reported that are believed to be linked to AstraZeneca vaccination.
A 49-year-old Queensland man, an 80-year-old Victorian man and 35-year-old NSW woman all had suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).
The TGA said there was a "likely link" as all three had received the AstraZeneca vaccine.
All were in a stable condition and recovering.
Victoria's Chief Health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, after himself receiving an AstraZeneca vaccination, said: "You are more likely to get a clot, whatever age you are, on a long-haul flight to Europe or North America."
Daniel Thomas, haematologist and researcher at the University of Adelaide agreed and said deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was "common".

===
New South Wales ===


====
2020 ====
Premier Gladys Berejiklian formed a "war cabinet" to make decisions in relation to the pandemic.
Members include herself, Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard and Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott.
On 15 March, Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education, Mark Scott ordered that, effective immediately, New South Wales schools introduce social distancing measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus.
The order required schools to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, concerts, large inter-school sporting and arts events, and other events that would require students and staff to congregate in large numbers.
Schools were to stay open.
Four schools in the state have been shut for periods during the crisis due to confirmed cases within their school communities.
On 16 March, New South Wales Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard announced that he was using his powers, under Section 7 of the 'Public Health Act 2010', to immediately and indefinitely cancel all public events with more than 500 attendees.
The order is enforceable by NSW Police and violations of the order can carry a prison term of six months, an $11,000 fine, or both.
Chief Justice Bathurst, Chief Justice of New South Wales, and Chief Judge Price of the District Court of New South Wales ordered that effective 16 March 2020, new jury trials would be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus.
The order did not apply to already empanelled jury trials.
Corrective Services New South Wales implemented screening mechanisms, early flu vaccination programs and stricter hygiene requirements for staff, visitors and inmates to slow the spread of the virus.
The University of Sydney cancelled all graduations, conferences, academic and student organised events.
The University of New South Wales announced that it was cancelling all student and academic events until Easter, encourage staff to work from home and, where possible, shift all lectures, tutorials, demonstrations and labs to online learning.
New South Wales schools were directed by the State Department of Education Secretary, Mark Scott, to cancel all assemblies, excursions, travel, and some events and conferences, including arts and initiative events, as well as whole school sporting events and inter-school sporting events with three or more involved schools.
Even though there was a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people, huge crowds flocked to the popular Bondi Beach and other beaches across Sydney on Friday 20 March.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said that such behaviour was "unacceptable" while the New South Wales Labor's Shadow Treasurer, Walt Secord urged the government to completely close off the beach.
New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott later stated in a televised interview that lifeguards were instructed to keep a head count of the people at the beach and if the number exceeded 500, the beach would be closed.
On 21 March, crowds built up yet again which led Waverley Council to temporarily close Bondi, and the other beaches of Bronte and Tamarama.
On 22 March, a public health order was issued that declared Lord Howe Island a public risk area and directed restricted access.
As of that date there were no known cases of COVID-19 on Lord Howe Island.
On 30 March, NSW Parliament passed the "COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement" law, which limited public gatherings to two people and directed, "that a person must not, without reasonable excuse, leave the person's place of residence.
"
It listed 16 reasonable excuses and took effect from midnight on 31 March.

As of 15 May, some restrictions on public and private gatherings were eased.
Private homes were allowed 5 visitors.
Free standing cafes and restaurants, and those inside pubs and clubs, were allowed very limited sit-down dining, after being restricted to take-away only since 23 March.
Bars and gaming areas remained closed.
A maximum of 10 people were permitted in restaurants and cafes, while social distancing rules still had to be followed.
Outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people were permitted.
Up to 10 guests were permitted at weddings, and funerals could have up to 20 mourners indoors, 30 outdoors.
Up to 10 people were allowed at indoor religious gatherings such as churches.
From 13 June, private homes were allowed to have up to 20 guests visit, and groups of 20 were allowed to meet outside.
Food courts were allowed to open, so long as the 4-square-metres-per-patron rule was kept, and no more than 50 patrons.
Indoor gym classes were allowed 10 participants.
Up to 100 persons were allowed inside gyms, so long as area requirements were adhered to.
From 1 July, New South Wales eased restrictions further due to the limited community transmission of COVID-19, at that time.
No set upper limit on patron numbers at indoor venues, but only one person per 4 square metres.
Outdoor venues, with a maximum capacity of 40,000, were allowed up to 25 per cent of normal capacity.
Events had to be ticketed, patrons seated and follow guidelines.
Restriction on funerals eased, but the four-square-metre rule applied.
Other existing restrictions, no more than 20 guests inside homes, 20 outside, remained in force.
Restrictions were tightened again on 17 July.
(
See below)
From 5 July, the Federal Government introduced restrictions on the number of passengers arriving at Sydney Airport.
A maximum of 50 passengers were allowed per flight, and international arrivals were set at 450 per day.
This was by request of the NSW Government to reduce pressure on hotel quarantine capacity.
More than 32,000 travellers had quarantined in Sydney hotels by this date.
On 6 July, the Victorian and NSW State Governments, jointly announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July, following a large spike in cases in certain areas of Melbourne.
As of 12:01 a.m. on 17 July, after an increase in cases, new rules for pubs were introduced.
Measures included, group bookings and persons at a table were limited to 10 (formerly 20), and a maximum of 300 people allowed inside any venue.
COVID Safe Hygiene Marshalls to oversee the venues COVID-19 infection prevention were also required, and venue
COVID-Safe registration was compulsory.
Paper-based sign-ins are allowed, but a digital record of patrons contact details, for contact tracing, must be provided on request.
Breaching the rules can result in a A$55,000 fine for the venue, plus another A$27,500 for each day the breach is continued.

2020 ====
=====
First lockdown =====
On 10 March, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Victorians to expect "extreme measures" in the wake of the federal government updating the travel advice for Italy.
These could include cancelling major sporting events, requiring entire economic sectors to work from home, and calling recently retired health professionals to return to work.
A state of emergency was declared on 16 March, which was extended on 12 April, with existing directions remaining in place including staying at home, restrictions on particular activities, detention, restrictions on airports and cruise ships, aged care, hospitals and isolation for people diagnosed with COVID-19.
It was extended further on 11 May, and again on 19 July to 16 August.
On 22 March, the school holiday was brought forward from 27 to 24 March.
On 14 April, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced that Victoria would have the widest coronavirus testing in Australia, with anyone having COVID-19 symptoms able to get tested.
The statement was issued that those who presented with fever or chills, in the absence of any other alternative diagnosis that explained the issue, or acute respiratory infection characterised by coughing, sore throat or shortness of breath should be tested for coronavirus.

=====
Second lockdown =====
On 20 June, the Victorian Government re-tightened restrictions on household gatherings following a spike in community transmitted cases over the previous week, reported to be mainly caused by family-to-family transmission in large household gatherings.
From 22 June, households could once again only have five visitors; and most easing of restrictions that were to take place were postponed.
On 30 June, the Victorian Government re-enforced local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes.
Residents there would need to comply with the four acceptable reasons to leave their houses:
shopping for essentials; for medical or compassionate needs; exercise in compliance with the public gathering restriction of two people; and for work or education purposes.
On 2 July, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the "Judicial Inquiry into Hotel Quarantine Program".
This followed some cases of coronavirus in Victoria being linked by DNA sequencing to a breach in hotel quarantine infection control.
The Inquiry was to "… examine the operation of Victoria's hotel quarantine program for returning travellers.
"
It was headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate, and was scheduled to deliver its report to the Governor by 25 September.
The inquiry was delayed by lockdown restrictions.
Andrews noted that "it is abundantly clear that what has gone on here is completely unacceptable and we need to know exactly what has happened."
An interim report was published on 6 November, and the inquirys final report was published on 21 December.
The Government response to the interim report was published in November.
On 4 July, the Victorian Government announced two more postcodes affected by the lockdown until 29 July 2020.
Nine public housing towers housing 3,000 residents were also added, with the additional condition that residents could not leave the tower under any circumstances for five days, with the possibility of an extension to 14 days.
The Victorian ombudsman later found the lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws.
On 6 July, the Victorian and NSW state Governments announced that their interstate border would be re-closed from the start of 8 July.
On 7 July, after recording 191 new cases, Premier Andrews announced that metropolitan Melbourne and the Shire of Mitchell would re-enter lockdown from 12 am on 9 July, for 6 weeks.
On 19 July, following a "concerning increase in coronavirus cases", Premier Andrews announced that "face coverings" were to be made mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne, and Mitchell Shire.
This was not enforced until after 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday 22 July to allow the populace time to acquire a face covering.
In addition, the state of emergency was extended until 16 August 2020.From 22 July, as the chance of coronavirus infection remained high in aged care and health care settings, visits were restricted to carers only, and with a limit of one hour per day.
From 23 July, "face coverings" in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire became mandatory whenever residents leave their homes.
A fine of A$200 was imposed to those not complying, though medical and other exemptions were allowed, such as not being required for children under 12 years of age.
On 2 August, a state of disaster was declared and metropolitan Melbourne was moved to Stage 4 restrictions.
A curfew across Melbourne from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. was imposed, a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius restriction as added, and other restrictions that had previously been applied only to selected postcodes were applied to the whole of metropolitan Melbourne.
A permit system was introduced for any residents that still needed to travel to work outside of their 5 km radius.
On 6 September (Father's Day), the "Roadmap for Reopening" was announced; a series of four steps towards "COVID Normal" which would begin on 13 September.
In the "First Step", which applied to metropolitan Victoria, several restrictions were eased including a reduction of the curfew, some loosening of rules around outdoor exercise and social interactions, the introduction of a "bubble" that allowed single people living alone to nominate one person to be allowed to visit them during the first two steps, and increased limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings.
At the same time, it was announced that regional Victoria would move to the "Second Step", which included a staged return of students to onsite learning as well as the reopening of outdoor public pools and further increases to limits for weddings, funerals and religious gatherings.

On 18 October, regional Victoria was moved to "Step Three", which included the reopening of most businesses to the public, increased seating for hospitality, the allowance of visitors for all residents and the resumption of some indoor sports.
At the same time, the 5 km limit in metropolitan Victoria was increased to 25 km (16 mi) and the two-hour time limit was removed, however the border between metropolitan and regional Victoria (often referred to as the "ring of steel") was strengthened with extra checkpoints added.

On 26 October, metropolitan restrictions were eased, with residents allowed to leave home for any reason, all retail businesses allowed to reopen, hospitality venues allowed to seat patrons, further relaxations on outdoor gatherings, and allowance of visitors to all residents, with some caveats.
The 25 km restriction and "Ring of steel" remained in place, however.

With a length of 112 days, Victoria's second lockdown was the longest continuous lockdown world-wide, as of October 2020.On 8 November, metropolitan restrictions were brought into line with regional restrictions with travel now being allowed to and from anywhere in the state.
Indoor recreation, community and entertainment venues were also reopened.
Restrictions on accommodation were also loosened in an effort to encourage intrastate tourism.
It was also announced that, subject to public health advice, Victoria would move to the "Last Step" on 22 November.
On 27 November, Victoria recorded its 28th consecutive day of 0 new cases and 0 deaths, and had 0 active cases, epidemiologically eliminating the virus.

=====
Resumption of Hotel Quarantine =====
On 30 November, the Victorian government announced that a new dedicated agency, "COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria" (CQV), had been created.
The interim Commissioner of CQV is the Commissioner of Corrections, Emma Cassar.
CQV is part of the government's response to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine Enquirys' interim report.
It will oversee all parts of the Victorian quarantine program: mandatory quarantine for people entering Australia, Health Hotels for positive and suspected cases, or close contacts, and Frontline Worker Accommodation.
The CQV Commissioner will be supported by three Deputy State Controllers.
Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie will lead the CQVs' health management.
Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther will provide expertise in enforcement.
As of 15 January 2021 the third Controller is still to be appointed.
On 17 December, the Victorian ombudsman tabled a report in the Victorian Parliament in which she found 4 July lockdown of the public housing towers breached human rights laws.
On 30 December, Victoria's 61-day streak of zero community cases came to an end as three community cases were identified, linked to the New South Wales outbreak.
As a precautionary measure for New Year's Eve the Victorian Government reduced household gatherings from 30 people to 15 and mandated masks within an indoor setting.
The border to New South Wales closed at 11:59 pm on 31 December, with returning Victorian residents from "green zones" that returned before the deadline made to isolate until they received a negative test result.
Those that returned afterwards would have to get tested and isolate for 14 days, aligning the restrictions with visitors from the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney that had been enforced 11 days prior.

On 3 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the first central bank to cut interest rates in response to the outbreak.
Official interest rates were cut by 0.25% to a record low of 0.5%.On 12 March, the Liberal Party announced a planned A$17.6 billion stimulus package.
The package consists of multiple parts: a one-off payment to pensioners, social security recipients, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders, payments of A$2,000–A$25,000 to affected small businesses, an increase to the threshold for the Instant Asset Write-off Program, tax concessions for investments, a small business 50% wage subsidy for 120,000 trainees and apprentices, and A$1 billion in subsidies for heavily affected industries.
On 17 March, the New South Wales government announced a A$2.3 billion stimulus package, including A$700 million for health services.
A$450 million was allocated to waive payroll tax for 3 months.
$250 million so state-owned buildings and public schools could employ more cleaners.
A$750 million was allocated for capital works and public asset maintenance.
On 18 March, the Northern Territory government announced an economic stimulus package of A$60 million.
On 19 March, the Reserve Bank again cut interest rates by a further 0.25%, from 0.5% to 0.25%, the lowest in Australian history.
In March 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) began releasing a number of additional statistical products to assess the economic impacts on the outbreak on the Australian economy.
Data on retail trade turnover indicated a 0.4% rise in turnover in February 2020.
Negative effects on some areas of the retail sector (particularly tourism-dependent businesses) were offset by a rise in food retail turnover, with supermarkets showing a large rise in sales, mainly arising from panic buying.

On 22 March, the Federal government announced a second stimulus package of A$66 billion, increasing the amount of total financial package offered to A$89 billion.
This included several new measures like an extra A$550 'Coronavirus Supplement' payment to those on income support, paid from 27 April to 24 September 2020, and relaxed eligibility criteria for individuals on JobSeeker Payment, granting A$100,000 to small and medium-sized businesses and A$715 million to Australian airports and airlines.
It also allowed individuals affected by the outbreak to access up to A$10,000 of their superannuation during 2019–2020 and also being able to take an additional same amount for the next year.
On 30 March, the Australian Government announced a six-month, A$130 billion JobKeeper payment.
The JobKeeper payment provides businesses with up to A$1,500 a fortnight per full-time or part-time employee, or casual employee that has worked for that business for over a year.
To be eligible, a business with an annual revenue of under A$1 billion must have lost 30% turnover since 1 March, or 50% for businesses over A$1 billion.
The entire payment made to businesses for an employee must then, by law, be paid to that employee in lieu of normal pay.
This response came after the enormous job losses seen just a week prior when an estimated 1 million Australians lost their jobs.
The program was backdated to 1 March with the aim of re-employing many people who had lost their jobs in the weeks before.
In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses registered to receive the payments.
The program is one of the largest economic packages ever implemented in modern Australian history.
JobKeeper ended on 28 March 2021.On 11 April the South Australian state government announced its own A$350 million economic stimulus measures.
In late April the Federal government announced A$94.6 million of support was available for zoos, wildlife parks and aquariums forced to close by coronavirus restrictions.
This was part of previously announced economic stimulus measures.
The 2020 Federal Budget, normally delivered in May, is delayed until 6 October because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 22 May 2020, the Treasury and Australian Taxation Office announced there had been a miscalculation of A$60 billion in the planned cost of the JobKeeper program.
Blaming 1,000 businesses for making "significant errors" on the application form, the Australian Government revealed it had overbudgeted the program, and that it was forecast to cost A$70 billion, not A$130 billion.
The Treasury also announced that its original forecast of 6.5 million recipients was inaccurate, and closer to 3.5 million.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison celebrated the saving, while the Opposition announced a parliamentary inquiry in an attempt to compel Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to explain the overestimation.
In July 2020, Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, in an interview with the US CNBC news channel, vowed that the government's budget deficit was expected to increase to A$85.8 billion Australian dollars in the financial year ended on 30 June and further widen to A$184.5 billion in the new fiscal year.
On 2 September the Australian economy went into recession for the first time in nearly thirty years.
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 7 per cent in the June quarter.
In December, it was announced Australia had pulled out of recession after experiencing a 3.3% growth in GDP in the September quarter.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg stated the effects of the recession had lasting impacts and the recovery was far from over.
Australia is set to avoid an economic depression as forecast earlier in 2020, though GDP is likely to have experienced a contraction from 2019 figures.
The 2020 Australian federal budget, delayed from May, is finally delivered on 6 October.

2021On 22 February 2021
, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that the JobSeeker Payment base rate would be increased by A$50 a fortnight from April 2021.
The payment will rise to A$614 a fortnight, with an estimated cost over forward estimates of A$9 billion.
It is also intended to increase the threshold amount recipients can earn before their payment starts to be reduced.
On 26 February 2021 the Chief Executive of the Australian Airports Association, James Goodwin, said that Australian airports had been losing A$320 million every month during the COVID-19 pandemic.
He also said over the past 12 months, job losses amounted to 25 per cent of the airports workforce.
On 10 March 2021 the Federal Government announced steps worth A$1.2 billion to encourage Australians to holiday within Australia to assist ailing tourist destinations.
Between April and July, up to 800,000 airfares to 13 regions normally favoured by international tourists will be halved for domestic travellers.

====
"Dine and Discover NSW" ====
On 17 November 2020 the NSW Government announced in the state budget that all NSW residents over 18 years-of-age would be eligible to receive four A$25 vouchers through Service NSW to help stimulate the economy.
Two vouchers are for dining, Monday to Thursday only, excluding public holidays.
The other two are to be spent on entertainment, excluding on public holidays.
Businesses need to be COVID-safe registered, and sign-up for the scheme.
The vouchers cannot be used for gambling, alcohol, cigarettes, retail purchases or accommodation.
The program was originally called "Out and About".
Residents will need to have a Service NSW account to receive their vouchers.
After trials in Sydney and regional areas, full rollout was scheduled for March.
The trials began in Broken Hill, and The Rocks in Sydney on 11 February 2021.

===
Employment ===
The pandemic had dramatic effects on the Australian rate of unemployment.
In July 2019 it was 5.1%, by July 2020
it peaked at 7.5%, during the pandemic, by the end of 2020
it had fallen to 6.6%.
Figures for February to March 2021, released in April, showed unemployment had reduced to 5.8 per cent, 0.4 points higher than at the start to the pandemic.

====
Agricultural worker shortage ====
In September 2020, a report from Ernst & Young stated that pandemic related border restrictions could result in a shortfall of 26,000 pickers over Australia's summer harvest season.
Such work is typically reliant on seasonal staff from overseas.
As a trial in early September 2020, 160 workers from Vanuatu were allowed into the Northern Territory (NT) to pick mangoes.
They arrived on a specially chartered aircraft, and had to undergo the usual 14-day quarantine.
It was estimated that the Vanuatuan workers saved A$100 million of fruit from the NT mango harvest being left to rot.
The mango industry in the NT was valued at more than A$128 million in 2019, and produces more than half of Australia's mangoes.
On 30 September 2020, PM Scott Morrison announced that: " … backpackers, Pacific Islanders and seasonal workers will be able to extend their visas to stay in Australia …" and "… welfare recipients will be offered incentives to pick fruit.
"In
late October 2020, some farmers found that they had to plough their produce back into the ground because it could not be harvested, at a loss of A$150,000.The "Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job" (RATTUAJ) program, scheduled to run from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, offers A$6,000 for transport, moving expenses, accommodation and work clothing for welfare recipients willing to relocate to a regional area for a minimum of 6 weeks for short term agricultural jobs.
Up to early December 2020, the relocation incentives for unemployed Australians appeared to be failing.
After operating for a month, Federal Department of Employment figures showed only 148 people had taken up the offer.
Shortage of workers for harvesting can not only mean unpicked produce being left to rot or be ploughed back into fields, and farmers possibly not planting the next year, it creates an economic loss to those farmers, and can also noticeably increase prices for consumers.

===
Arts ===
Before the crisis, 600,000 Australians were employed in the arts, an industry which added around A$3.2 billion to export revenues.
The rate of employment in the sector grew at a faster rate than the rest of the economy.
According to government figures, "cultural and creative activity contributed to A$112 billion (6.4% of GDP) to Australia's economy in 2016–17".
Beginning in the second week of March 2020, Australian institutions began announcing reduced services, and then complete closures.
One of the first casualties was the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, with organisers announcing on 13 March 2020 that the 2020 festival had been cancelled entirely.
Opera Australia announced it would close on 15 March.
The national closure of all cultural institutions was mandated on 24 March, with subsequent restrictions on public gatherings.
Consequently, many cultural events were also cancelled, including the Sydney Writers' Festival.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by the beginning of April, "Arts and Recreation services" was the sector of the national economy with the smallest proportion of its business still in operation – at 47%.
A graph in Guardian Australia showing businesses by sector that had ceased trading between June 2019 and 30 March 2020 shows over 50% of arts and recreation services, the hardest hit of any sector (information media and telecommunications is next, at about 34%).
Adrian Collette, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts, the government's arts funding and advisory body, described the impact on the cultural and creative sectors as "catastrophic".
The Australian film industry has been severely impacted, with at least 60 shoots being halted and about 20,000 people out of work.
On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed.
As of 15 April 2020, after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget.
Film industry organisations such as Screen Producers Australia (SPA) and the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA) have been lobbying the government for a support package specific to the screen industry, and to expand the JobKeeper requirements so that those in the screen industry are better covered.
Many in the film industry are employed by Special Purpose Vehicles – temporary companies that cease trading once production has finished – which cannot easily prove that their turnover has fallen by 30% or more.
SPA said that the industry shutdown had cost more than A$500 million, with about A$20 million of lost export revenue.
One hundred and nineteen films and TV shows have been halted, with only a few shows (such as MasterChef Australia and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell) continuing production through the pandemic.
The TV soap Neighbours was the first English-language TV drama series in the world to announce that resumption of production would begin soon after 20 April 2020.Like
other governments around the world, the Australian government has acknowledged the economic, cultural and social value of the arts industry.
The Australia Council has redirected about A$5 million to "new programs designed to provide immediate relief to Australian artists, arts workers and arts organisations to support their livelihoods, practice and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic" (the "Resilience Fund"), and is also hosting weekly meetings to address the concerns of specific sections of the industry, such as Indigenous creatives and organisations, live performance and public gatherings, and various peak bodies.
Several state governments have also provided relief packages.
In early April, the federal government announced a package of A$27 million in specific arts funding: A$7 million for the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program, A$10 million for Regional Arts Australia's regional arts fund, and A$10 million for Support Act, a charity founded in 1997 that provides financial support and counselling to people in the music industry in Australia.
However, the "JobKeeper" scheme specifically excluded "freelancers and casuals on short-term contracts, or who have worked for a series of employers in the last year", thus excluding a large proportion of arts and cultural sector professionals, who rely on short-term contracts.
However, most of the arts sector's more than 193,000 workers were still unable to access the JobKeeper payments, despite being defined as sole traders, and an estimated A$330 million worth of paid performances cancelled.
The Australia Institute recommended a A$750 million rescue package for the industry, while Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said that arts workers should utilise existing support measures.
On 4 May 2020, the company operating the Carriageworks multi-arts venue in Sydney declared it would be entering voluntary administration and closing, citing an "irreparable loss of income" due to government bans on events during the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent negative impact on the arts sector.
Carriageworks was the first major arts venue in the country to collapse suddenly after the hit to income caused by the strict social distancing rules enforced by state and federal governments, but others feared the same fate, after being forced to shut their doors in late March.
On 13 May 2020, the Art Gallery of South Australia announced that it would reopen on 8 June.
On 24 June 2020, the federal government announced a $250 million rescue package for the arts, comprising grants and loans.
The package includes $75m for a grants program for new festivals, concerts, tours and events; $90m in loans to help fund new productions;
$50m to help film and television producers unable to access insurance due to the pandemic, to enable them to restart production; and $35 million in direct financial assistance for struggling Commonwealth-funded organisations, including theatre, dance, music and circus.
The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) welcomed the boost, but critics said that it was not nearly enough, especially with so many workers in the industry still ineligible for JobKeeper payments.

===
Indigenous Australians ===
Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the non-Indigenous Australian population, particularly those living in remote areas, and along with overcrowded housing and many living in very remote communities, makes them one of the communities most vulnerable to the virus.
The remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY lands) in South Australia, whose population has many comorbidities, high rates of tobacco use, overcrowded housing and overall poor hygiene, introduced restricted access to the lands in early March to protect their people, especially elders, from the virus.
The Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said it was a sensible move, and that the federal government would work with them.
(
A later call to evacuate elders to Adelaide by the APY Art Centre Collective was not put into operation.)

The federal government set up a national Indigenous advisory group in early March, to create an emergency response plan for Aboriginal communities.
The 43-page plan was published in March, and in late March, the Prime Minister that advised that Indigenous Australians over the age of 50 (along with everyone over 70 and those with a chronic illness over 60), should stay at home as much as possible.
The Department of Health created a web page dedicated to advice for Indigenous people and remote communities, and the National Indigenous Australians Agency has one dedicated to the government's response to COVID-19.
On 18 April the NIAA announced a government package of A$123 million of "targeted measures to support Indigenous businesses and communities to increase their responses to COVID-19", for the coming two financial years.
The Northern Territory developed a remote health pandemic plan, with NT Health setting up a number of remote clinics across the Territory.
All non-essential travel to the 76 remote communities was banned, and a 14-day isolation period imposed for those residents wanting to return home from regional centres, and in May, health officials suggested that these controls should stay in place for the foreseeable future.
In mid-March, a group of senior NT clinicians called for 16 measures to be implemented as soon as possible to help protect vulnerable communities.
Other states and territories have provided advice on their health agency websites.
A group of Barkindji families set up a tent town on the banks of the Darling River near Wilcannia in New South Wales, to escape the threat of the disease from overcrowded accommodation in the town.

===
Sport ===
The major sporting leagues (A-League, AFL, AFL Women's, and the National Rugby League) initially stated that their seasons would not be suspended but would continue behind closed doors, with some games being played under those conditions.
However all the leagues were later suspended.

AthleticsInitially
the 2020 Stawell Gift was postponed until later in the year, however in May it was cancelled entirely for 2020.

Australian rules
footballThe AFL season was initially curtailed to a maximum of 17 games, with clubs expected to take at least a 10% revenue hit from coronavirus related issues.
However, on 22 March, just before the end of round 1 of the 2020 season, AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan announced that the AFL season would be suspended until at least 31 May, citing the shutting of state borders as the primary cause for this decision.
The AFL season restarted on 11 June, with the Grand Final being played on 24 October at the The Gabba in Brisbane, Queensland, the first Grand Final to be held outside Victoria.
The 2020 AFL Women's season was cancelled midway through the finals series, with no premiership awarded to any team.

BasketballThe
2020 NBL Finals began with game two, although it was stated that the competition would be immediately suspended if any participants were to be diagnosed.
The best of five series was subsequently cancelled after the third game was played with the title awarded to Perth Wildcats.
All second-tier state basketball leagues were either postponed or cancelled.

CricketThe remaining two One Day Internationals between Australia and New Zealand were cancelled after the first match was played behind closed doors.
Cricket Australia also cancelled the Australian women's cricket team's tour of South Africa due to the virus.

MotorsportsThe first sporting event in Australia to be affected was the 2020 Australian Grand Prix, which was cancelled on 13 March after McLaren withdrew when a team member tested positive for COVID-19.
This was also enforced on the support races which included the 2020 Melbourne 400, which was the second round of the 2020 Supercars Championship to be cancelled.
The 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed from its original March date to November to allow for the easing of travel restrictions.

Rugby leagueFollowing
the implementation of travel restrictions by New Zealand, the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) announced that the New Zealand Warriors would be based in Australia for the foreseeable future.
The 2020 season was suspended indefinitely on 23 March.
Chairman of the ARLC Peter V'landys requested a government bailout for the National Rugby League, a request that was struck down, and caused a considerable negative reaction.
On 22 April, the NRL announced that they planned for the season to restart on 28 May, with training beginning on 4 May, and has planned for 18 rounds (giving a 20-round season) and a State of Origin series, with the Grand Final rescheduled for 25 October.
The NRL season recommenced on 28 May with a round 3 game played in Brisbane between the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels.
The match was played behind closed doors without any crowd, although the broadcasters (Channel 9 and Fox Sports) used fake crowd noise during the broadcast.
The return match rated highly on TV as it was the first TV match of a team sport in Australia for 8 weeks.
The Grand Final was played in front of a limited crowd on 25 October at ANZ Stadium.

The 2020 State of Origin series took place after the NRL season, with Game 3 holding a capacity crowd at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium.

Rugby unionThe 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended following the conclusion of play on 15 March, due to the outbreak and the imposition of mandatory quarantine for international travellers to New Zealand.

SoccerThe A-League initially announced a continuation of the league with the Wellington Phoenix being based in Australia; however, on 24 March, suspended the remaining matches indefinitely.
On 17 July, the season resumed in a NSW-based hub, where the season finished with the Grand Final occurring at Bankwest Stadium on 30 August in front of a limited crowd.

Yacht racingThe 2020 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was cancelled on 19 December due to an outbreak in the Greater Sydney region.

===
Protests ===
On 3 January 2021, an anti-mask protest was held inside Westfield Bondi Junction in New South Wales.
This was the first day that new mask wearing requirements, including venues like shopping centres, came into effect.
On 23 January 2021 an anti-mask protest was stopped by NSW Police from entering the Westfield Parramatta shopping centre.
Warning was given to the group to obey public health orders, and follow social distancing guidelines.
One man was arrested when he did not comply with the police directive when the group dispersed after they were given a move-on direction.
A protest group was also turned away from the Parramatta Westfield a week earlier.
On 12 February, there was an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne.
Two were arrested.
On 20 February, anti-COVID-19 vaccine rallies were held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.
There were a few hundred people at each.
The Federal Government COVID-19 vaccination program was scheduled to start on 22 February, but the first doses were administered on 21 February.
During the 2021 Australian Open, an official referred to the COVID-19 vaccine as a sign of optimism, which was followed by booing by the fans present at the event.
The Australian government criticized the reaction of the fans and called it "disgusting".
===
Medication supply ===
The pandemic has created shortages of some medications since it began, initially related to panic buying.
The most commonly used antidepressant in Australia, sertraline, is one of many such as the brand Zoloft, that have been affected by a global shortage.
Olmesartan and irbesartan, both blood pressure medications were short in Australia as were hormone replacement therapy (HRT) patches and carbimazole, a thyroid medication.
As of February 2021 the contraceptive pill "Norimin" (norethisterone) was hard for pharmacists to acquire, supply had been intermittent for 6–12 months.
Shortages of Norimin and Brevinor, both Pfizer products, were reported in August 2020 and first predicted to last until December 2020, the shortage was then expected by the TGA "... to be resolved in March or April 2021".
In the case of sertraline a Serious Shortage Substitution Notice (SSSN) was issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).
SSSNs were also issued in Australia for Prazosin (blood pressure), Metformin (diabetes), and Estradot (HRT), which in theory allows substitutions like issuing twice the number of 25 mg tablets in place of the prescribed 50 mg tablets, without a new prescription, but with the patients' consent.
Chris Moy, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) said medicine shortages in Australia were a "pre-existing problem" before COVID-19.

I think somewhere in the order of 89 percent of all day-to-day prescription medications are supplied from overseas; they often say 'patented in Australia'
but they are actually made overseas.

Moy also said "A lot of our medications are made in China and India.
Sovereign capability and protecting supply of our medications is something that should be seriously considered.
"The
TGA gave short-term approval for the import of some medicines that are "not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) that are approved for import and supply in Australia because: there is a shortage of a medicine registered in Australia; and the medicine is needed in the interest of public health."

== Relaxation of restrictions ==


===
Travel ===
On 2 October 2020, Prime Minister Morrison announced that the Australian Government had formalised a deal allowing New Zealanders "one-way quarantine-free travel" into New South Wales and the Northern Territory from 16 October as part of initial steps to establish a "travel bubble" between the two countries.
However, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ruled out extending reciprocal "quarantine-free travel" for Australians in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 into New Zealand.
On 17 October 2020, Stuff reported that 17 New Zealanders who had entered New South Wales traveled to Melbourne despite Victoria not being a party to the travel bubble arrangement with New Zealand.
The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the arrival of the group but stated that it did not have the authority to detain them.
In response, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews threatened to close his state's borders unless the Australian Federal Government blocked travellers using the Trans-Tasman bubble from traveling to Victoria.
The Federal Government has disagreed with the Victorian Government's stance.
In addition, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that her government would not prevent New Zealand passengers from travelling to Victoria.
On 11 December 2020, the Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that her state would open its borders to travelers from New Zealand from 1:00 am the following day (12 December), exempting them from quarantine restrictions.
On 14 December 2020, the New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern announced that the New Zealand Government had approved plans to establish a quarantine free travel bubble with Australia in the first quarter of 2021.
Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt welcomed the move, describing it as the "first step" in normalising international travel and reiterated the Australian Government's support for measures to establish the travel bubble.
On 25 January 2021, the Federal government immediately suspended the ability of New Zealanders to travel to Australia that they had since 16 October 2020, without quarantining, for at least 72 hours.
This followed the discovery of a NZ resident with the South African COVID-19 variant.
The woman was not known to be infectious, having twice tested negative to COVID-19 before leaving quarantine, then visited many places in northern NZ, but she was then found to have the new strain.
On 19 April 2021, Australians were allowed quarantine-free travel to New Zealand for the first time in more than a year.
To fly under the bubble's rules, passengers must have spent 14 days before departure in either Australia or New Zealand, however they are not required to spend the full 14 day period or more in the other country, i.e. a person has spent at least 14 days in Australia, flies to New Zealand and returns to Australia after 7 days.
They must not be awaiting the results of a Covid test, nor have any Covid symptoms, amongst other criteria.

===
Melbourne ===
On 26 October, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews announced the relaxation of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in Melbourne, ending the 112-day lockdown period.
From 28 October, all repair stores, restaurants, cafes, and bars were allowed to reopen with a 10-person limit; home visits were allowed; outdoor gatherings including weddings were limited to ten people; and funerals were limited to 20 people.
From 11:59 p.m. on 8 November, the 25 km travel limit in Greater Melbourne, and the border between Melbourne and regional Victoria was lifted; gyms and fitness studios were allowed to reopen; and the patron limit at restaurants, cafes and bars was raised.

==
Demand for investigation ==
On 19 April 2020, Australia questioned China's handling of the pandemic, questioned the transparency of its disclosures, and demanded an international investigation into the origins of the virus and its spread.
The Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye, in a rare breach of diplomatic protocol, leaked details of his telephone conversation with Frances Adamson, Secretary of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the embassy website.
He warned that the demand for an inquiry could result in a consumer boycott of students and tourists visiting Australia, and could affect sales of major exports.
A trade dispute involving improperly labelled beef and barley dumping ensued, which seriously affected Australian exports.
On 26 August 2020, China's deputy ambassador to Australia, Wang Xining, expressed that Australia's co-proposal for an independent investigation into the causes of the pandemic "hurts the feelings of the Chinese people" during his address to the National Press Club of Australia.

==
Event cancellations ==
Numerous events in 2020 were cancelled, rescheduled, postponed, reduced in size, or changed location.

On 9 March 2020, the government of Italy under Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a national lockdown or quarantine, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances, in response to the growing pandemic of COVID-19 in the country.
Additional lockdown restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses.
This followed a restriction announced on the previous day which affected sixteen million people in the whole region of Lombardy and in fourteen largely-neighbouring provinces in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont and Marche, and prior to that a smaller-scale lockdown of ten municipalities in the province of Lodi and one in the province of Padua that had begun in late February.

The lockdown measures, despite being widely approved by the public opinion, were also described as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the republic.
Nevertheless, Article 16 of the Constitution states that travel restrictions may be established by law for reasons of health or security.

==
Background ==
Following the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, the Italian government confirmed the country's first cases of the disease on 30 January 2020, when the virus was detected in two Chinese tourists visiting Italy.
A third case was confirmed on 7 February, with the patient being an Italian man evacuated from Wuhan.
The number of confirmed cases increased on 21 February, when sixteen people in Lombardy and Veneto were confirmed to be infected.
Following the first two deaths of people with the virus, several towns in Lombardy were placed on lockdown due to the large number of infected patients in the region.

==
History ==


===
Initial lockdowns ===
The first lockdown began around 21 February 2020, covering ten municipalities of the province of Lodi in Lombardy and one in the province of Padua in Veneto, and affecting around 50,000 people.
In the most affected town of Codogno (pop.
16,000), police cars blocked roads into and out of the quarantined area and erected barriers.
The quarantined "red zone" (zona rossa) was initially enforced by police and Carabinieri, and by 27 February it was reported that 400 policemen were enforcing it with 35 checkpoints.
The lockdown was initially meant to last until 6 March.
While residents were permitted to leave their homes with supplies such as food and medicine being allowed to enter, attending school or going to workplaces was not allowed, and public gatherings were prohibited.
Train services also bypassed the region.

===
Expansion to northern provinces ===
Early on Sunday 8 March 2020, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the expansion of the quarantine zone to cover much of northern Italy, affecting over sixteen million people, restricting travel from, to or within the affected areas, banning funerals and cultural events, and requiring people to keep at least one metre of distance from one another in public locations such as restaurants, churches and supermarkets.
Conte later clarified in a press conference that the decree was not an "absolute ban", and that people would still be able to use trains and planes to and from the region for "proven work needs, emergencies, or health reasons".
Additionally, tourists from outside were still permitted to leave the area.
Restaurants and cafes were permitted to open, but operations were limited to between 6:00 and 18:00, while many other public locations such as gyms, nightclubs, museums and swimming pools were closed altogether.
Businesses were ordered to implement "smart working processes" to permit their employees to work from home.
The decree, in effect until 3 April, additionally cancelled any leave for medical workers, and allowed the government to impose fines or up to three months' jail for people caught leaving or entering the affected zone without permission.
The decree also implemented restrictions on public gatherings elsewhere across Italy.
With this decree, the initial "Red Zone" was also abolished (though the municipalities were still within the quarantined area).The lockdown measures implemented by Italy was considered the most radical measure implemented against the outbreak outside of the lockdown measures implemented in China.
At the time of the decree, over 5,800 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Italy, with 233 dead.
A draft of the decree had been leaked to the media late on Saturday night before it went into effect and was published by Corriere della Sera, resulting in panic within the to-be-quarantined areas and prompting reactions from politicians in the region.
La Repubblica reported that hundreds of people in Milan rushed out to leave the city on the last trains on Saturday night, as a part of a rush in general to leave the expanded red zone.
La Repubblica later reported that this was an exaggeration and that, through an analysis of telephone cells, less than 1,000 people had left Milan for the southern regions during 7 March; by comparison, on 23 February, about 9,000 people left Milan for the south.
However, within hours of the decree being signed, media outlets reported that relatively little had changed, with trains and planes still operating to and from the region, and restaurants and cafes operating normally.
The BBC reported that some flights to Milan continued on 8 March, though several were cancelled.
New guidelines for the coronavirus had assigned the responsibility of deciding whether to suspend flights to local judiciaries.

The locked down area, as of 8 March 2020, covered the entirety of the region of Lombardy, in addition to fourteen provinces in Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, and Marche.
This area included the cities of Milan and Venice, and comprises three separate areas (around Lombardy, around Venice, and another zone surrounding San Marino).
The affected area is populated by over sixteen million people, roughly a quarter of the Italian population.
Quarantines covered an area of approximately 56,000 square kilometres (22,000 sq mi).
===
Nationwide expansion ===
On the evening of 9 March, the quarantine measures were expanded to the entire country, coming into effect the next day.
In a televised address, Conte explained that the moves would restrict travel to that necessary for work, and family emergencies, and that all sporting events would be cancelled.
Italy was the first country to implement a national quarantine as a result of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak.
Conte announced on 11 March that the lockdown would be tightened, with all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, like grocery stores, food stores, and pharmacies, closed down.
On 19 March, with over 35,000 confirmed cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from the disease, Conte stated that the lockdown would likely be extended past its initial deadline of 3 April.
Luigi Di Maio, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has said that the lockdown has been necessary for Italy.
The Italian authorities established sanctions for those who do not obey the orders, even those who, having symptoms of the virus, expose themselves in public places, being considered a threat of intentional contagion.
On 21 March, Conte announced a further enlargement of the lockdown, by shutting down all non-necessary businesses and industries.
This measure came after a rise in the number of cases and deaths in the previous days, and after multiple institutions – including trade unions, mayors, and regional presidents – asked for a generalised shutdown of the Italian production system.
On 22 March, Lombardy strengthened its measures, banning all outdoor physical activity and the use of vending machines.
On 1 April, Minister of Health Roberto Speranza announced the extension of the lockdown until 13 April.
On 10 April, the lockdown was extended until 3 May, and starting from 14 April stationery shops, bookshops and children clothing's shops will be allowed to open.
On 26 April, the Prime Minister announced the so-called "Phase 2", that would start from 4
May. Movements across regions were still forbidden, while the ones between municipalities were allowed only for work and health reasons as well as for visit relatives.
Moreover, he allowed the re-opening of closed factories, but schools, bars, restaurants and barbers were still closed.
==
Impact ==


===
Economy ===
The New York Times Rome bureau chief Jason Horowitz referred to the expanded lockdown as "sacrificing the Italian economy in the short term to save it from the ravages of the virus in the long term", with Milan considered the country's economic capital while Venice was one of its most important tourist destinations.
The regions of Lombardy and Veneto alone produced a third of the Italian gross domestic product.
Prior to the quarantine's expansion, the Italian economy was already forecast to enter a recession due to the impact of the outbreak, with the tourism and luxury goods sector being particularly hard-hit by a reduction of travel.
The impact of the wider quarantine is predicted to bring the European economy as a whole into a recession, and will disrupt supply chains to, for example, German car manufacturers like Volkswagen.
Prior to the quarantine, Scope Ratings GmbH estimated on 2 March an annual contraction in Italian GDP in 2020, with the budget deficit rising past 2.5% of GDP.
The Berenberg Bank revised its forecast for the Italian economic growth in 2020 from -0.3% before the lockdown to -1.2%.
An economist at London-based consultancy Capital Economics estimated Italy's 2020 GDP decline to be 2 percent after the national lockdown, assuming that the lockdown is lifted on schedule.
Reuters reported on 20 March that Ministry of Economy and Finance was expecting a 3% GDP contraction in 2020, assuming the lockdown would be loosened by the end of April.
On 1 April, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri stated that a 6% GDP contraction for 2020 was "realistic".
The FTSE MIB, Italy's benchmark stock index, fell 11 percent on 9 March when the market reopened, dubbed "Black Monday".
Particularly hard-hit sectors due to the lockdown are the hospitality, food service, retail, art, entertainment and transport sectors, altogether making up around 23 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
Tourism, another 6 percent, is also forecasted to experience a crisis, with normally crowded destinations being empty.

===
Environment ===
During the lockdowns in early 2020, emissions of nitrogen dioxide, or NO2, fell drastically in northern Italy, most likely as a result of fewer diesel engines in operation.

===
Effectiveness ===
The effects on social movement of such measures were visible.
A reduction of 50% of movement between provinces and of 19% of personal interactions comparing 22 February and 10 March was calculated by the company Cuebiq and the University of Turin using data from mobile phone companies.
On 17 March, the vice-president of Lombardy Fabrizio Sala reported a level of an overall 60% decrease of social mobility in the region, comparing the situation of 16 March to 20 February, although such level was not considered sufficient.
About 700,000 citizens were stopped and checked between 11 and 17 March alone, of which 43,000 were decided to have violated the quarantine, including at least two priests who were officiating funeral services (which were banned by the decree).The comparison of the province of Lodi (where a rigid lockdown was imposed in certain areas starting on 24 February) and
the province of Bergamo (where it started later on 9 March) on 17 March showed that the first one recovered faster and the exponential increase of cases stopped.
On 3 April, Google published a series of mobility reports, using aggregated data to show the trend of how busy some categories of places were, and comparing them to a baseline evaluated in the months of January and February.
The data for Italy showed a 94% drop for retail and recreation places, an 85% drop for grocery shops and pharmacies, a 90% drop for parks and beaches, an 87% drop for public transit hubs, a 63% drop for workplaces, and a 24% rise for residential places.
Apparently, the differences in lockdown efficacy are also due to the different characteristics of the population of Italian regions.
One of the bigger discontinuities to this respect is social capital.
Unlike what previous literature suggests on the topic, results on the lockdown seem to rehabilitate the role of this familistic declination of the social capital, highlighting at least a positive role in directing individual behavior toward greater respect of the policy characterized by a net benefit of the original family.

==
Reactions ==


===
Domestic ===
Both Attilio Fontana, the President of Lombardy, and Luca Zaia, the President of Veneto, criticised the quarantine measures, with Fontana requesting better clarification regarding the quarantine from the central government, while Zaia opposed it altogether.
President of Emilia-Romagna Stefano Bonaccini called the decree "confusing" and requested the central government take more time to develop a "coherent" solution.
Maurizio Rasero, mayor of the quarantined municipality of Asti, posted a video on his Facebook page complaining about the sudden announcement of the quarantine, of which he had not been informed beforehand.
The decree was also criticised by local business leaders, who claimed that the decree did not have sufficient clarifications on the details of the quarantine.
Matteo Salvini, Italy's opposition leader, also demanded further clarity regarding the lockdown.
On the other hand, Novara's mayor Alessandro Canelli mentioned that he was surprised by the initial information he received that his province would not be part of the quarantine zone, and had requested for Novara's inclusion due to its significant transport links with Milan.
President of Marche Luca Ceriscioli agreed to the measures, although he mentioned a need for more participation from the impacted territories.
Responding to the thousands of people who evacuated from Lombardy just before the 8 March quarantine was put in place, police officers and medics met passengers from Lombardy in Salerno, Campania, and the passengers were required to self-quarantine.
Michele Emiliano, President of Apulia, required all arrivals from northern Italy to self-quarantine.
Similarly, Jole Santelli, President of Calabria, called for Calabrians living in northern Italy not to return home during the outbreak, and for the government to "block an exodus to Calabria".
Conte, alongside other leaders, requested Italians to avoid engaging in "furbizia"—i.e.
craftiness to circumvent rules and bureaucracy—during the lockdown.
Conte also told la Repubblica that Italy was facing its "darkest hour".

===
Residents ===
In the initial quarantine, a special radio station (Radio Zona Rossa, or "Radio Red Zone") was set up for residents of the Codogno quarantine area, broadcasting updates on the quarantine situation, interviews with authorities, and government information.
Catholic sermons were also broadcast through the radio.
Following the quarantine's expansion, the hashtag #IoRestoACasa ("I stay at home") was shared by thousands of social media users.
In compliance with regulations on keeping one metre of distance between each other in public locations, bars and restaurants placed duct tape on floors for their customers to follow.
Rushes to supermarkets in cities such as Rome and Palermo were reported as residents engaged in panic buying following the nationwide quarantine announcement.

===
Vatican ===
After the Italian national lockdown was announced, the Vatican closed the Vatican Museums and suspended Masses and public liturgies.
While the St. Peter's Basilica remained open, its catacombs were closed and visitors were required to follow the Italian regulations on the one-metre separation.
Catholic Mass in Rome and the Vatican were also suspended until 3 April, and Pope Francis opted to instead live stream daily
Mass. Dismayed by the Vicar General's complete closure of all churches in the Diocese of Rome, Pope Francis partially reversed the closures, but tourists are still barred from visiting the churches.

===
International ===
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, praised Italy's decision to implement the lockdown, saying the Italian people and government were "making genuine sacrifices" with these "bold, courageous steps".
Sun Shuopeng, vice president of the Chinese Red Cross, visited Milan and heavily criticised the enforcement of the lockdown, saying "the lockdown measures are very lax".
According to a survey by Bloomberg, Italy and Spain rank among the countries which have more strictly complied with lockdown measures.

Full text of the 8 March decree (in Italian)
The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).
The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 29 April 2021, more than 149 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.15 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe.
Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.
Small droplets containing the virus leave an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enter another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes.
Airborne transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller infected droplets can linger in the air for minutes to hours within enclosed spaces that have inadequate ventilation.
Less commonly, the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces.
People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.
Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.
Several vaccines have been developed and widely distributed since December 2020.
Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns/quarantines, workplace hazard controls, and business closures.
Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.
The pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.
It has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption and food shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.
Numerous educational institutions and public areas have been partially or fully closed, and many events have been cancelled or postponed.
Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media.
The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights.

==
Epidemiology ==


===
Background ===
Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown, the first outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China in late 2019.
Many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease "COVID-19", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2)
, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Scientific consensus is that COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus that arose from bats in a natural setting, although the exact original host and cross-species infection routes remain in need of further investigation.
Despite this, the subject has generated a significant amount of online conspiracy theories.
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 November.
Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two thirds were found to have a link with the market.
There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.

===
Cases ===
Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.
An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.
Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.
On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.
Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.
Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.
Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.
Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.
It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.
A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).
R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity.
By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.

===
Deaths ===
Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.
These counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.
Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.
Comparisons of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicate excess mortality in many countries.
This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.
The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.
More than 95 percent of the people who contract COVID-19 recover.
Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.
As of 29 April 2021, more than 3.15 million deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
People at the greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as those with a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.
Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.1 percent (3,153,526 deaths for 149,744,454 cases) as of 29 April 2021.
The number varies by region.

====
Reporting ====
On 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, indicated the WHO had provided two codes for COVID-19: U07.1 when confirmed by laboratory testing and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiological diagnosis where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.
The CDC noted that "Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics" and that U07.1 would be used "
If the death certificate reports terms such as 'probable COVID-19' or 'likely COVID-19'.
"
The CDC also noted "It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases" and while the "underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, ... the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not.
"On
16 April 2020, the WHO, in its formal publication of the two codes, U07.1 and U07.2, "recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.
"
It was also noted that the WHO "does not distinguish" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
====
Infection fatality ratio (IFR) ====
A crucial metric in assessing the severity of a disease is the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals (including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections) as measured or estimated as of a specific date.
Epidemiologists frequently refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality rate' to clarify that it is expressed in percentage points (not as a decimal).
Other published studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality
risk'.
In April 2020, an IFR range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed serology surveys, with the upper bound characterised as much more credible and the range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).In June 2020, a peer-reviewed analysis of pre-serology data from mainland China yielded an overall IFR of 0.66% (with age-bracketed values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9 years to 0.595% for 50–59 years to 7.8% for > 80 years).In July 2020, the US CDC adopted the IFR as a "more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19" and computed an overall 'best estimate' for planning purposes for the U.S. of 0.65%.

In August 2020, the WHO reported serology testing for three locations in Europe (with some data through 2 June)
that showed IFR overall estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.
A systematic review article in The BMJ advised that "caution is warranted ... using serological tests for ... epidemiological surveillance" and called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of "RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures."
CEBM researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record "CT lung findings and associated blood tests" and for the WHO to produce a "protocol to standardise the use and interpretation of PCR" with continuous re-calibration.
In September, the CDC computed an age-bracketed 'best estimate' for the U.S. of 0.003% for 0–19 years; 0.02% for 20–49 years; 0.5% for 50–69 years; and 5.4% for 70+ years.
In September 2020, a Bulletin of the World Health Organization article by John Ioannidis estimated the median global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23% overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high mortality) and 0.05% for people < 70 years (a range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic.
On 6 October 2020, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme announced "Our current best estimates tell us that about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus."
Also in October, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) reported a 'presumed estimate' of global IFR at between 0.10% to 0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.
These researchers noted a decrease in IFR in England over time; and, for the UK and Italy (the two European nations worst hit by COVID-19), attribute the rise in daily cases, stability in daily deaths, and shift of cases to a younger population to waning viral circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus mutation.
In November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for a number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%.In December 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the European Journal of Epidemiology estimated that population-weighted IFR was 0.5% to 1% in some countries (France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in several other countries (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and about 2.5% in Italy; these estimates included fatalities in elderly care facilities.
This study also found that most of the differences in IFR across locations reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and the age-specific pattern of infection rates, due to very low IFRs for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher IFRs for older adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).
These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the World Health Organization.

====
Case fatality ratio (CFR) ====
Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (CFR), which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.
This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).
On 4 August, WHO indicated "at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of CFR by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%."

Vaccines ===
On 21 December 2020, the European Union approved the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine.
Vaccinations began to be administered on 27 December 2020.
The Moderna vaccine was authorized on 6 January 2021 and the AstraZeneca vaccine was authorized on 29 January 2021.

On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19, covering "any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID-19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the declaration precludes "liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct".
The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.
On 8 December it was reported that the AstraZeneca vaccine is about 70% effective, according to a study.

===
Treatment ===
There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Thus, the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 is supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.

Most cases of COVID-19 are mild.
In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing.
Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.
People with more severe cases may need treatment in hospital.
In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the risk of death.
Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in clinical trials.
Others were thought to be promising early in the pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found them to be ineffective or even harmful.
Despite ongoing research, there is still not enough high-quality evidence to recommend so-called early treatment.
Nevertheless, in the United States, two monoclonal antibody-based therapies are available for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease.
The antiviral remdesivir is available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to limited evidence of its efficacy.

===
Variants ===
Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged that are spreading globally.
The most currently prevalent, all of which share the D614G mutation, are:
B.1.1.7, first detected in the UK, which has spread to over 70 countries
P.1, first detected in Brazil, which has spread to more than 4 countries
B.1.351, first detected in South Africa, which has spread to over 30 countries
B.1.427, first detected in California, which has spread to 14 countries
B.1.429, first detected in California, which has spread to 25 countries


===
Prognosis ===


==
Mitigation ==
Speed and scale are key to mitigation, due to the fat-tailed nature of pandemic risk and the exponential growth of COVID-19 infections.
For mitigation to be effective, (a) chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health care must be available to provide for the needs of those infected, and (c) contingencies must be in place to allow for effective rollout of (a) and (b).

===
Screening, containment and mitigation ===
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation.
Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the infection.
Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading.
When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.
Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.

====
Contact tracing ====
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
(
Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)On 10 April 2020
, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.
The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.
In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.

===
Health care ===
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.
On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing.
NASA is seeking fast-track approval.

History ==


=== 2019
===
Based on the retrospective analysis, starting from December 2019, the number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December.
On 24 December 2019, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.
On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.
A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December 2019, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result.
Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January), were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours; and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".
The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases—enough to trigger an investigation.
The following day, on December 31, the WHO learned about a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of an unknown cause in Wuhan.
An investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.According to official Chinese sources, the early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.
However, in May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.
In March 2021, the WHO published their report on the potential zoonotic source of the virus.
The WHO concluded that human spillover via an intermediate animal host was the most likely explanation, with direct spillover from bats next most likely and introduction through the food supply chain as another possible explanation.

=== 2020 ===
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.
On 10 January, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later) and more may have been infected.
A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".
On 31 January The Lancet would publish the first modelling study explicitly warning of inevitable "independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally" and calling for "large-scale public health interventions.
"On 30 January 2020, with 7,818 confirmed cases across 19 countries, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and then a pandemic on 11 March 2020 as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported increasing numbers of cases.

On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.
As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.
On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.
By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.
Research on SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travelers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.
Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019 and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being officially reported, the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.
As of 15 June 2020, 79 cases were officially confirmed.
Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.
On 29 June 2020, WHO warned that the spread of the virus was still accelerating as countries reopened their economies, despite many countries having made progress in slowing down the spread.
On 15 July 2020, one COVID-19 case was officially reported in Dalian in more than three months.
The patient did not travel outside the city in the 14 days before developing symptoms, nor did he have contact with people from "areas of attention.
"In
October 2020
, the WHO stated, at a special meeting of WHO leaders, that one in ten people around the world may have been infected with COVID-19.
At the time, that translated to 780 million people being infected, while only 35 million infections had been confirmed.
In early November 2020, Denmark reported on an outbreak of a unique mutated variant being transmitted to humans from minks in its North Jutland Region.
All twelve human cases of the mutated variant were identified in September 2020.
The WHO released a report saying the variant "had a combination of mutations or changes that have not been previously observed.
"
In response, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ordered for the country – the world's largest producer of mink fur – to cull its mink population by as many as 17 million.
On 9 November 2020, Pfizer released their trial results for a candidate vaccine, showing that it is 90% effective against the virus.
Later that day, Novavax entered an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine.

Virologist and U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
director Anthony Fauci indicated that the Pfizer vaccine targets the spike protein used to infect cells by the virus.
Some issues left to be answered are how long the vaccine offers protection, and if it offers the same level of protection to all ages.
Initial doses will likely go to healthcare workers on the front lines.
On 9 November 2020 the United States surpassed 10 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, making it the country with the most cases worldwide by a large margin.
It was reported on 27 November, that a publication released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the current numbers of viral infection are via confirmed laboratory test only.
However, the true number could be about eight times the reported number; the report further indicated that the true number of virus infected cases could be around 100 million in the U.S.On 14 December 2020, Public Health England reported a new variant had been discovered in the South East of England, predominantly in Kent.
The variant, named Variant of Concern 202012/01, showed changes to the spike protein which could make the virus more infectious.
As of 13 December, there were 1,108 cases identified.
Many countries halted all flights from the UK; France-bound Eurotunnel service was suspended and ferries carrying passengers and accompanied freight were cancelled as the French border closed to people on 20 December.

=== 2021 ===
On 2 January, VOC-202012/01, a variant of SARS-CoV-2 first discovered in the UK, had been identified in 33 countries around the world, including Pakistan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Norway, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, India, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, and China.
On 12 January, it was reported that a team of scientists from the World Health Organization would arrive in Wuhan on the 14th of the month; this is to ascertain the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and determine what were the intermediate hosts between the original reservoir and humans.
On the following day, two of the WHO members were barred from entering China because, according to the country, antibodies for the virus were detected in both.
On 25 January, the Brazil variant was detected in Minnesota.
On 29 January, it was reported that the Novavax vaccine was only 49% effective against the 501.V2 variant in a clinical trial in South Africa.
The China COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac indicated 50.4% effectivity in a Brazil clinical trial.
On 12 March, it was reported that several countries including Thailand, Denmark, Bulgaria, Norway, and Iceland had stopped using the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine due to what was being called severe blood clotting problems, a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
Additionally, Austria halted the use of one batch of the aforementioned vaccine as well.
On 20 March, the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link between thrombus (a blood clot of clinical importance), leading several European countries to resume administering the AstraZeneca vaccine.
On 29 March, it was reported that the U.S. government was planning to introduce COVID-19 vaccination 'passports' to allow those who have been vaccinated the ability to board airplanes, cruise ships as well as other activities.
As of 29 April 2021, more than 149 million cases have been reported worldwide due to COVID-19; more than 3.15 million have died and more than 86.9 million have recovered.

==
National responses ==
A total of 192 countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).
The WHO's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted.
To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the long-term responses to the pandemic should consist of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.
By 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.
By late April 2020, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.
Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, around 100 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.

===
Asia ===
As of 30 April 2020, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases.
Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly Bhutan, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam has allowed them to fare comparatively well.
China was criticised for initially minimising the severity of the outbreak, but its wide-scale response has largely contained the disease since March 2020.
As of 29 January 2021, Singapore has the lowest case fatality rate in the world at
<0.1%.The pandemic has had direct side effects, per a report on 28 November, in Japan.
According to the report by the country's National Police Agency, suicides had increased to 2,153 in October.
Experts also state that the pandemic has worsened mental health issues due to lockdowns and isolation from family members, among other issues.

====
China ====
As of 14 July 2020, there are 83,545 cases confirmed in China— excluding 114 asymptomatic cases, 62 of which were imported, under medical observation; asymptomatic cases have not been reported prior to 31 March 2020—with 4,634 deaths and 78,509 recoveries, meaning there are only 402 cases.
Hubei has the most cases, followed by Xinjiang.
By March 2020, COVID-19 infections have largely been put under control in China, with minor outbreaks since.
It was reported on 25 November, that some 1 million people in the country of China have been vaccinated according to China's state council; the vaccines against COVID-19 come from Sinopharm which makes two and one produced by Sinovac.

====
India ====
The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020.
India ordered a nationwide lockdown for the entire population starting 24 March 2020, with a phased unlock beginning 1 June 2020.
Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country—Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.
On 10 June 2020, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.
On 30 August 2020, India surpassed the US record for the most cases in a single day, with more than 78,000 cases, and set a new record on 16 September 2020, with almost 98,000 cases reported that day.
As of 30 August 2020, India's case fatality rate is relatively low at 2.3%, against the global 4.7%.As of September 2020, India had the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia; and the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world, behind the United States, with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May 2020, 1,000,000 on 16 July 2020, and 5,000,000 confirmed cases on 16 September 2020.On 19 December 2020, India crossed the total number of 10,000,000 confirmed cases but with a slow pace.
The Indian Ministry of Science initiated a mathematical simulation of the pandemic, the so-called "Indian Supermodel", which correctly predicted the decrease of active cases starting in September
2020.A second wave hit India in April 2021, placing healthcare services under severe strain.
By late April, the government was reporting over 300,000 new infections and 2,000 deaths per day, with concerns of undercounting.

====
Iran ====
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people had died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, Friday prayers, and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran allocated 5 trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000) to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020
there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March 2020, although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year
Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March.
Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China in February 2020.
More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March 2020.
On 15 March 2020, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March 2020.
By 23 March 2020, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to COVID-19.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.
On 20 April 2020, Iran reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country.
After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June 2020, raising fear of a second wave.
On 18 July 2020, President Rouhani estimated that 25 million Iranians had already become infected, which is considerably higher than the official count.
Leaked data suggest that 42,000 people had died with COVID-19 symptoms by 20 July 2020, nearly tripling the 14,405 officially reported by that date.

====
South Korea ====
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.
By 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms.
South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 29 February, more than 3,150 confirmed cases were reported.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.
Airline schedules were also changed.
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.
Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day, and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
Despite some early criticisms of President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis, South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Persistent local groups of infections in the greater Seoul area continued to be found, which led to Korea's CDC director saying in June that the country had entered the second wave of infections, although a WHO official disagreed with that assessment.

===
Europe ===
On 21 August, it was reported the COVID-19 cases were climbing among younger individuals across Europe.
On 21 November, it was reported by the Voice of America that Europe is the worst hit area by the COVID-19 virus, with numbers exceeding 15 million cases.

====
France ====
Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.
A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.
On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places, and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until
11 May. As of 14 September, France has reported more than 402,000 confirmed cases, 30,000 deaths, and 90,000 recoveries, ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.
In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.
On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.
On 12 November, it was reported that France had become the worst-hit country by the COVID-19 pandemic, in all of Europe, in the process surpassing Russia.
The new total of confirmed cases was more than 1.8 million and counting; additionally it was indicated by the French government that the current national lockdown would remain in place.

====
Italy ====
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February 2020.

On 22 February 2020, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided.
Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas.
"On 4 March 2020
, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths.
All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March 2020, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.
On 6 March 2020, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.
On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most COVID-19-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.
On 22 March 2020, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 28 March, there were 3,532,057 confirmed cases, 107,933 deaths, and 2,850,889 recoveries in Italy, with a large number of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.
On 19 April 2020, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses were asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.

On 13 October 2020, the Italian government again issued restrictive rules to contain a rise in infections.
On 11 November, it was reported that Silvestro Scotti, president of the Italian Federation of General Practitioners indicated that all of Italy should come under restrictions due to the spread of COVID-19.
A couple of days prior Filippo Anelli, president of the National Federation of Doctor's Guilds (FNOMCEO) asked for a complete lockdown of the peninsular nation due to the pandemic.
On the 10th, a day before, Italy surpassed 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases.
On 23 November, it was reported that the second wave of the virus has caused some hospitals in Italy to stop accepting patients.

====
Spain ====


====
Sweden ====
Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.
Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favoured forgoing a lockdown.
The Swedish strategy focused on measures that could be put in place over a longer period of time, based on the assumption that the virus would start spreading again after a shorter lockdown.
The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.
On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.
In the end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality.

====
United Kingdom ====
Devolution in the United Kingdom meant that each of the four countries of the UK had its own different response to COVID-19, and the UK government, on behalf of England, moved quicker to lift restrictions.
The UK government started enforcing social distancing and quarantine measures on 18 March 2020 and was criticised for a perceived lack of intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government ordered all leisure establishments to close as soon as possible, and promised to prevent unemployment.
On 23 March, Johnson banned gatherings of multiple people and restricting non-essential travel and outdoor activity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings.
Most non-essential businesses were ordered to close.
On 24 April, it was reported that a promising vaccine trial had begun in England; the government pledged more than £50 million towards research.
A number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.
The first operating was the 4,000-bed NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed for over nine days.
On 4 May, it was announced that it would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities; 51 patients had been treated in the first three weeks.
On 16 April, it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.
On 2 December, the UK became the first Western country to approve the Pfizer vaccine against the COVID-19 virus; 800,000 doses would be immediately available for use.
It was reported on 5 December that the United Kingdom would begin vaccination against the virus on 8 December, less than a week after having been approved.
On 9 December, MHRA stated that any individual with a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, such as an anaphylactoid reaction, should not take the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19 protection.

Brazil ====
On 20 May, it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities.
With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.
On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths.
President Jair Bolsonaro has created controversy by referring to the virus as a "little flu" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines.
His attitude towards the outbreak has been likened to that of former U.S. President Trump, with Bolsonaro being called the "Trump of the Tropics".
Bolsonaro later tested positive for the virus.
In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths.
On 5 June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths.
The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of the previous 24 hours.
The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths.
On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.
Brazil briefly paused Phase III trials for the Coronavac COVID-19 vaccine on 10 November after the suicide of a volunteer before resuming on 11 November.
By early 2021, the death toll had climbed to 231,534.
The total number of cases on 7 February exceeded 9.5 million.
The only countries with worse outbreaks were India and the United States.

International responses ==
The COVID-19 pandemic shook the world's economy, with especially severe economic damage in the United States, Europe, and Latin America.
A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April 2021 concluded, "Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally, as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized groups."
Furthermore, COVID-19 has inflamed partisanship and polarization around the world as bitter arguments explode over who to scapegoat and who to help first.
The risks include further disruption of international trade and the formation of no-entry enclaves.

===
Travel restrictions ===
As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas, or for all travellers.
Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector.
Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.
A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.
Researchers concluded that "travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late".
The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy, a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.

===
Evacuation of foreign citizens ===
Owing to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.
Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.
On 14 March 2020, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.
Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.
On 15 February 2020, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.
On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

===
United Nations response measures ===
The United Nations response to the pandemic has been led by its Secretary-General and can be divided into formal resolutions at the General Assembly and the Security Council (UNSC), and operations via its specialised agencies.
In June 2020, the Secretary-General launched its 'UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19'.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNSC) has been criticised for a slow coordinated response, especially regarding the UN's global ceasefire, which aims to open up humanitarian access to the world's most vulnerable in conflict zones.

WHO response measures ====


===
Protests against governmental measures ===
In several countries, protests have risen against governmental restrictive responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lockdowns.
A February 2021 study found that large protest rallies against coronavirus measures are likely to directly increase the spread of viruses including the coronavirus.

Impact ==


===
Economics ===
The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes.
One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China.
On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08) and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook.
Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.
Lloyd's of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season and 11 September attacks, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.

Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel.
Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The cruise line industry was hard hit, and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.
The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent.
North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop.
This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.

Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally.
More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims.
The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating between 30 and 40 million Americans are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020.
According to a report by Yelp, about 60% of U.S. businesses that have closed since the start of the pandemic will stay shut permanently.
According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.
According to the World Bank, up to 100 million more people globally could fall into extreme poverty due to the shutdowns.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) informed that the income generated in the first nine months of 2020 from work across the world dropped by 10.7 per cent, or $3.5 trillion, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.

====
Supply shortages ====
The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.
The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust).
The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.
According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.
The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was worldwide.
The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine.
The Yuancheng Group, headquartered in Wuhan, is one of the leading suppliers.
Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the streets of the UK.
U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors.
The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis.
David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said "we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months."
Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve, for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020.

====
Oil and other energy markets ====
In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.
June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.
===
Culture ===
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally.
Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.
By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.

Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The 2020 Hajj was limited to around 1,000 selected pilgrims, in contrast to the usual number of over 2 million.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020,
2019–20 NBA season, 2019–20 NHL season, and 2020 Arctic Winter Games.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, which were originally scheduled to start at 24 July 2020, and were postponed by the International Olympic Committee to 23 July
2021.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in May, was cancelled; however, the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021.
Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work.
The large number of people working or learning from home via videoconferencing software led to several new terms and trends, including "Zoom fatigue", a decline in demand for formal clothing, and increased fashion focus on masks and clothes for the upper body (the lower body generally not being visible on a videoconference).
The term "doomscrolling" became more widely used.
Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.
A popular Twitter account called "Room Rater" jokingly commented on and assigned numerical scores to the backgrounds of journalists and others appearing in mass media from home.

===
Politics ===
The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities, isolations or deaths of multiple politicians, and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.
Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus, although research has determined that they were not.
Although they have broad support among epidemiologists, social distancing measures have been politically controversial in many countries.
Intellectual opposition to social distancing has come primarily from writers of other fields, although there are a few heterodox epidemiologists.
On 23 March 2020, United Nations Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres issued an appeal for a global ceasefire in response to the pandemic; 172 UN Member States and Observers signed a non-binding statement in support of the appeal in June, and the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting it in July.

====
China ====
The government of China has been criticised by the United States, the UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and others for its handling of the pandemic.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine measures in China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak.
Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect CCP general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.
The U.S. intelligence community claims China intentionally under-reported its number of COVID-19 cases.
The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.
However, journalists and activists who have reported on the pandemic have been detained by authorities, such as Zhang Zhan, who was arrested and tortured for reporting on the pandemic and the detainment of other independent journalists.

====
Italy ====
In early March, the Italian government criticised the EU's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy—Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said "only China responded bilaterally", not the EU.
On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."

In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant, and Ursula von der
Leyen offered an official apology to the country.

====
United States ====
The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts believe it may have contributed to Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election.
Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.
Simultaneously, protests ensued by essential workers in the form of a general strike.
In early October 2020, Donald Trump, his family members, and many other government officials were diagnosed with COVID-19, further disrupting the country's politics.

====
Other countries ====
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, was held on a reduced scale.
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying "it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating.
"The
Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.
Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.
Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
In some countries, including Egypt, Turkey, and Thailand, opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.
In India, journalists criticising the government's response were arrested or issued warnings by police and authorities.
Rates of imprisoned or detained journalists increased worldwide, with some being related to the pandemic.
The government of the UK faced criticism after the now-former Chief of Staff Dominic Cummings was discovered multiple times breaking lockdown.

===
Agriculture and food systems ===
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted agricultural and food systems worldwide.
COVID-19 hit at a time when hunger or undernourishment was once again on the rise in the world, with an estimated 690 million people already going hungry in 2019.
Based on the latest UN estimates, the economic recession triggered by the pandemic may lead to another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.
This is mainly due to a lack of access to food – linked to falling incomes, lost remittances and, in some cases, a rise in food prices.
In countries that already suffer from high levels of acute food insecurity, it is no longer an issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food production.
The pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production.
As a result, several famines are forecast, which the UN called a crisis "of biblical proportions," or "hunger pandemic.
"
It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that "12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger" by the end of 2020.

This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019–2021 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way.

55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario.
265 million people are forecast to be in famine conditions, an increase of 125 million due to the pandemic.

Xenophobia and racism ===
Heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East and Southeast Asian descent.
Reports from February 2020 (when most confirmed cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus.
Chinese people and other Asian peoples in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump was criticised for referring to the COVID-19 as the "Chinese Virus" and "Kung Flu", which has been condemned as racist and xenophobic.
On 14 March, an Asian family, including a two-year-old girl, was attacked at knifepoint in Texas in what the FBI has called a COVID-19 related hate crime.
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia, as were people from hotspots in other countries.
Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.
As of late April 2020, Paris had seen riots break out over police treatment of marginalised ethnic groups during the then in-place lockdown.
Racism and xenophobia towards South Asian groups increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.
South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.
In China, some people of African descent  were evicted from their homes and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.
This policy was criticised by some foreign governments, diplomatic corps, and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.

Lifestyle change adaptation during the pandemic ===
The pandemic has resulted in many people adapting to massive changes in life, from increased internet commerce activity to the job market.
Social distancing has caused increased sales from large e-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Coupang.
Online retailers in the US posted 791.70 billion dollars in sales in 2020, an increase of 32.4% from 598.02 billion dollars from the year before.
The trend of home delivery orders have increased due to the pandemic, with indoor dining restaurants shutting down due to lockdown orders or low sales.
Hackers and cybercriminals/scammers have started targeting people due to the massive changes, with some pretending to be part of the CDC, and others using different phishing schemes.
Education worldwide has increasingly shifted from physical attendance to video conferencing apps such as Zoom as lockdown measures have resulted in schools being forced to shut down.
Due to the pandemic, mass layoffs have occurred in the airline, travel, hospitality, and some other industries.
(
There is no sign of a permanent recovery as of March 2021.)

Information dissemination ==
Ongoing COVID-19 research is indexed and searchable in the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio.
Some newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their COVID-19-related articles and posts, while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.
Maps have played a key role in disseminating information concerning the spatial distribution of the disease, especially with the development of dashboards to present data in near real-time.
Methods of data visualisation have drawn some criticism, however, in the over-simplification of geographical patterns indicated by choropleth maps that adopt national, rather than local, map scales.
