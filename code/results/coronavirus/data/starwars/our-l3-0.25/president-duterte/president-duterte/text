covid-19 vaccination in australia began on monday 22 february 2021, and will continue throughout the-year with the-goal of vaccinating all willing australians before 2022.
the-two-vaccines currently approved for administration in australia are classified as being "provisionally approved", meaning that the-two-vaccines currently approved for administration in australia have been deemed safe and effective based on clinical-and-scientific-data and are in the-process of non-expiring-registration.

a-44-year-old-victorian-man was admitted to melbourne's-box-hill-hospital on 2 april 2021 when a-44-year-old-victorian-man developed serious-thrombosis and a-low-platelet-count after receiving the-astrazeneca-vaccine on 22 march.
canada and germany had already suspended the-use of astrazeneca for people under the-age of 55 and 60-years, respectively.
on 11-march 2021, the-australian-medical-association attested that it was implausible that the-government's-target of offering vaccination to every-australian by october 2021 would be achieved and suggested that mid-december 2021 would be a-more-realistic-date.
the-government had aimed to administer 60,000-doses by the-end of february but ended up administering only-31,000-doses.
the-federal-government said that the-eu blocked the-shipment of more-than-3-million-doses of vaccine to australia is a-major-reason for the-delayed-vaccine-rollout, although the-eu the-eu only officially confirmed the-export-blocking of only-250,000-doses in early-march.

the-coronavirus-pandemic was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan, china.
recommended-preventive-measures include social-distancing, wearing face-masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand-washing, covering one's-mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.
several-vaccines have been developed and widely distributed since december 2020.
an-analysis of the-early-phase of the-outbreak up to 23 january estimated 86-percent of covid-19-infections had not been detected, and that these-undocumented-infections were the-source for 79-percent of documented-cases.
initial-estimates of the-basic-reproduction-number (r0) for covid-19 in january were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a-subsequent-analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a-95-percent-confidence-interval of 3.8 to 8.9).

it was also noted that the-who "does not distinguish" between infection by sars-cov-2 and covid-19.
in april 2020, an-ifr-range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed-serology-surveys, with the upper bound characterised as much more credible and the-range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).in june 2020, a-peer-reviewed-analysis of pre-serology-data from mainland-china yielded an-overall-ifr of 0.66% (with age-bracketed-values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9-years to 0.595% for 50–59-years to 7.8% for > 80 years).in july 2020, the-us-cdc adopted the-ifr as a-"more-directly-measurable-parameter for disease-severity for covid-19" and computed an-overall-'best-estimate' for planning-purposes for the-u.s. of 0.65%.

in september 2020, a-bulletin of the-world-health-organization-article by john-ioannidis estimated the-median-global-ifr inferred from seroprevalence-data at 0.23% overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low-mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high-mortality) and 0.05% for people <-70-years (a-range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the-pandemic.
in november 2020, a-review-article in nature reported estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities, and found a-median-range of 0.24% to 1.49%.in december 2020, a-systematic-review and meta-analysis published in the-european-journal of epidemiology estimated that population-weighted the-median-global-ifr was 0.5%-to-1% in some-countries (france, netherlands, new-zealand, and portugal), 1% to 2% in several-other-countries (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and about 2.5% in italy; estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities included fatalities in elderly-care-facilities.

lineage-b.1.1.7 (formerly known as variant of concern 202012/01 (voc 202012/01)) is believed to have emerged in the-united-kingdom in september 2020.
the-501.v2-variant, which has the-same-n501y-mutation was detected in patient-specimens collected at the-beginning of october 2020 and currently spread globally.

the-first-known-case was identified in wuhan, china, in december 2019.
in january 2020, the-who recommended 2019-ncov and 2019-ncov-acute-respiratory-disease as interim-names for the-virus and disease per 2015-guidance and international-guidelines against using geographical-locations (e.g.-wuhan, china), animal-species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social-stigma.
the-official-names covid-19 and sars-cov-2 were issued by the-who on 11-february 2020.
tedros-adhanom explained: co for corona, vi for virus, d for disease and 19 for when the-outbreak was first identified (31 december 2019).
the-who additionally uses "the-covid-19-virus" and "the-virus responsible for covid-19" in public-communications.
three-known-variants of sars-cov-2 are spreading among global-populations as of january 2021, including the-uk-variant (referred to as b.1.1.7) first found in london and kent, a-variant discovered in south-africa (referred to as 1.351), and a-variant discovered in brazil (referred to as p.1).using whole-genome-sequencing, epidemiology and modelling suggest the-new-uk-variant vui-202012/01 (the-first-variant under investigation in december 2020) transmits more easily than other-strains.
the-who has published several-testing-protocols for the-disease.
in late 2019, the-who assigned emergency-icd-10-disease-codes-u07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection and u07.2 for deaths from clinically-or-epidemiologically-diagnosed-covid-19 without lab-confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection.

the-who and the-us-cdc recommend individuals wear non-medical-face-coverings in public-settings where there is an-increased-risk of transmission and where social-distancing-measures are difficult to maintain.
the-who recommends ventilation and air-filtration in public-spaces to help clear-out-infectious-aerosols.
the-who also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at-least-twenty-seconds, especially after going to the-toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's-nose.
for areas where commercial-hand-sanitisers are not readily available, the-who provides two-formulations for local-production.
the-cdc reports that in the-us roughly-a-third of hospitalized-children were admitted to the-icu, while a-european-multinational-study of hospitalized-children from june 2020 found that about-8% of children admitted to a-hospital needed intensive-care.
four of the-582-children (0.7%) in a-european-multinational-study of hospitalized-children from june 2020 died, but the-actual-mortality-rate could be "substantially lower" since milder-cases that did not seek medical-help were not included in the-study.
since sars-cov-2 has been in the-human-population only since december 2019, sars-cov-2 remains unknown if the-immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the-disease.
in august, the-who found that studies incorporating data from broad-serology-testing in europe showed ifr estimates converging at approximately-0.5–1%.
in september 2020 the-u.s.-center for disease-control & prevention reported preliminary-estimates of age-specific-ifrs for public-health-planning-purposes.
later-reviews in june 2020 indicated that there is no-significant-difference in susceptibility or in cfr between genders.
as of april 2020, the-us-government is not tracking sex-related-data of covid-19-infections.
the-who issued a-report in 2007 that showed that more-than-half-the-sars-cases at the-beginning of 2000 were women.
in august 2020 the-cdc issued a-caution that tuberculosis-(tb)-infections could increase the-risk of severe-illness or death.
the-who recommended that people with respiratory-symptoms be screened for both-diseases, as testing positive for covid-19 could not rule out co-infections.
phylogenetics estimates that sars-cov-2 arose in october or november 2019.
a-study of the-first-41-cases of confirmed-covid-19, published in january 2020 in the-lancet, reported the-earliest-date of onset of symptoms as 1 december 2019.
official-publications from the-who reported the-earliest-onset of symptoms as 8-december 2019.
human-to-human-transmission was confirmed by the-who and chinese-authorities by 20-january 2020.
traces of the-virus have been found in wastewater-samples that were collected in milan and turin, italy, on 18-december 2019.by december 2019, the-spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human-transmission.
on 30-january, the-who declared the-coronavirus a public health emergency of international-concern.
the-who considered europe the active centre of the-pandemic.
retesting of prior-samples found a-person in france who had the-virus on 27-december 2019, and a-person in the-united-states who died from the-disease on 6-february-2020.rt-pcr-testing of untreated-wastewater-samples from brazil and italy have suggested detection of sars-cov-2 as early as november and december 2019, respectively, but the-methods of such-sewage-studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a-risk of false-positives due to contamination or if only-one-gene-target is detected.
a-september-2020-review-journal-article said, "the-possibility that the-covid-19-infection had already spread to europe at the-end of last-year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence," including pneumonia-case-numbers and radiology in france and italy in november and december.
in september 2020, the-u.s.-cdc published preliminary-estimates of the-risk of death by age-groups in the-united-states, but preliminary-estimates of the-risk of death by age-groups in the-united-states were widely misreported and misunderstood.
as of december 2020, hundreds of clinical-trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every-continent except antarctica.
as of november 2020, more-than-200-possible-treatments had been studied in humans so far.
2.in march 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) initiated the-solidarity-trial to assess the-treatment-effects of some-promising-drugs: an-experimental-drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial-drugs-chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two-anti-hiv-drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and interferon-beta.

because this is a-well-tested-and-widely-available-treatment, this was welcomed by the-who, which is in the-process of updating treatment-guidelines to include dexamethasone and other-steroids.
in september 2020, the-who released updated-guidance on using corticosteroids for covid-19.
the-who recommends systemic-corticosteroids rather than no systemic-corticosteroids for the-treatment of people with severe-and-critical-covid-19
the-who suggests not to use corticosteroids in the-treatment of people with non-severe-covid-19
in september 2020, the-european-medicines-agency (ema) endorsed the-use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve-years of age and weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb) who require supplemental-oxygen-therapy.
in november 2020, the-u.s.-food-and-drug-administration (fda) issued an-emergency-use-authorization for bamlanivimab for the-treatment of mild-to-moderate-covid-19.
in february 2021, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the-treatment of mild to moderate-covid‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb) who test positive for sars‑cov‑2 and who are at high-risk for progressing to severe-covid‑19.

a-cochrane-review in october 2020, found insufficient-evidence to recommend for or against this-treatment in covid-19, due in large-part to the-methodology of the-clinical-trials conducted so far.

during a-pandemic on the-rapid-timeline and scale of covid‑19-infections during 2020, international-organizations like the-who and cepi, vaccine-developers, governments, and industry are evaluating the-distribution of the eventual vaccine(s).
in april 2020, it was reported that the-uk agreed to work with 20-other-countries and global-organizations including france, germany and italy to find a-vaccine and to share the-results and that uk-citizens would not get preferential-access to any-new-covid‑19-vaccines developed by taxpayer-funded-uk-universities.
the-who and cepi are developing financial-resources and guidelines for global-deployment of several-safe,-effective-covid‑19-vaccines, recognizing the-need is different across countries and population-segments.
some-countries used accelerated dose-1-plans with extended-dose-2-intervals after the-first-dose in order to extend vaccination to as-many-people as possible until vaccine-availability improved.
data from april 2021 comports with this-expectation since 25% of the-population in high-income-countries have been vaccinated compared to only-0.2% in low-income-countries.
despite opposition from some-vaccine-manufacturers, cepi revised cepi february-2020-equitable-access-policy to apply specifically to cepi covid‑19 vaccine funding: "prices for vaccines will be set as low as possible for territories that are or may be affected by an-outbreak of a-disease for which cepi funding was used to develop a-vaccine; "information,-know-how and materials related to vaccine-development must be shared with (or transferred to) cepi" so that it can assume responsibility for vaccine-development if a-company discontinues expenditures for a-promising-vaccine-candidate
"cepi would receive a-share of financial-benefits that might accrue from cepi-sponsored vaccine development, to re-invest in support of cepi mission to provide global-public-health-benefit"; and data-transparency among development-partners should maintain the-who-statement on public-disclosure of clinical-trial-results, and require results to be published in open-access-publications.
initially one-observer considered the-us-position unlikely to change, but as of april 2021 the-us-administration is discussing the-merits of waiving the-patent-rights.
the-who has promoted the-covid-19-technology-access-pool to facilitate such-disclosures but participation is voluntary and none of the-vaccine-manufacturers have joined.
without this-knowledge, reverse engineering the-process is difficult with no-guarantee of success.
as of march 2021, the-united-states had ordered twice-the-necessary-doses to cover the-united-states own-population, but the-united-states remained unclear when the-united-states might share surplus-doses with other-countries.
in april 2021, vanity-fair reported that it would be difficult to share surplus-doses with other-countries because the-u.s.-government had expressly agreed in the-u.s.-government contracts with vaccine-manufacturers to use doses only in the-united-states and the-united-states territories.
favored-distribution of vaccines within one-or-a-few-select-countries, called "vaccine sovereignty", is a-criticism of some of the-vaccine-development-partnerships, such as for the astrazeneca-university of oxford vaccine candidate, concerning whether there may be prioritized distribution first within the-uk and to the-"highest-bidder" – the-united-states, which made an-advance-payment of us$1.2 billion to secure 300-million-vaccine-doses for americans, even before the astrazeneca-oxford vaccine or a-sanofi-vaccine was proved safe or effective.
in june, the-serum-institute of india (sii) – a-major-manufacturer of global-vaccines – reached a-licensing-agreement with astrazeneca to make 1-billion-doses of vaccine for low-and-middle-income-countries, of which half of the-doses would go to india.
in the-later-half of february 2021, vaccine-tourism == was reported that wealthy-and-influential-people from canada-and-european-countries flew to the-united-arab-emirates to secure early-access to a-vaccine.

as of september 2020, supply-chain-and-logistics-experts expressed concern that international-and-national-networks for distributing a-licensed-vaccine were not ready for the-volume and urgency, due mainly to deterioration of resources during 2020-pandemic-lockdowns and downsizing that-degraded-supply-capabilities.
addressing the-worldwide-challenge faced by coordinating numerous-organizations – the-covax-partnership, global-pharmaceutical-companies, contract-vaccine-manufacturers, inter- and-intranational-transport, vaccine-storage-facilities, and health-organizations in individual-countries – seth-berkley, chief-executive of gavi, stated: "delivering billions of doses of vaccine to the-entire-world efficiently will involve hugely-complex-logistical-and-programmatic-obstacles all the way along the-supply-chain. "
included are logistics-tools for vaccine-forecasting and needs estimation, in-country vaccine management, potential for wastage, and stock-management.
by august 2020, when only-a-few-vaccine-candidates were in phase-iii-trials and were many months away from establishing safety and efficacy, numerous-governments pre-ordered more-than-two-billion-doses at a-cost of more than us$5 billion.
pre-orders from the-british-government for 2021 were for five-vaccine-doses per person, a number dispiriting to organizations like the-who and gavi which are promoting fair-and-equitable-access worldwide, especially for developing-countries.
sinovac aimed to complete a-second-production-line by february 2021 to increase production of coronavac to 1-billion-doses a year, while sinovac brazilian partner instituto butantan planned to produce 100-million-doses, and sinovac indonesian partner bio farma planned to produce up-to-250-million-doses a year.

to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-who recommends a-response to the-pandemic that consists of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.
some include total-movement-control while others have enforced restrictions based on time.
beginning with the-first-lockdown in china's-hubei-province in january 2020 and the-entirety of italy in march, lockdowns continued to be implemented in many-countries throughout 2020 and 2021.
similarly, modelling on australian-data concluded that achieving zero-community-transmission through a-strict-lockdown lowers healthcare-and-economic-costs compared to less-stringent-measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early-relaxation of restrictions have greater-costs.
during the-early-stages of the-pandemic in europe and the-united-states, statistical-modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a-large-number of deaths were used as the-basis for lockdowns.
