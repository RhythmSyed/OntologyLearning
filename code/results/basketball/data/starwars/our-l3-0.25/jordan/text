in september 2015, the-nba announced changes to the-format of the-nba playoffs that would begin with the 2016 the-nba playoffs.
series are played in the-2–2–1–1–1-format, meaning the-team with home-court-advantage-hosts-games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while series opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5–7 being played if needed.
once the-playoffs start, the-bracket is fixed; teams are never "reseeded", unlike in the-national-football-league (nfl) where the-strongest-remaining-teams face the-weakest-teams in subsequent-rounds.
on numerous-occasions, eastern conference teams with losing records qualified for the-playoffs, while western-conference-teams with winning-records ended up missing western-conference-teams with winning-records, including the 2011, 2013 and the-2015-nba-playoffs.
in 1947 the-philadelphia-warriors won the-runners-up-bracket and beat the-western-champion chicago-stags four games to one, which the-nba recognizes as the-nba first championship; in 1948 baltimore won the-runners-up and beat eastern-champion-philadelphia in the-final.
with only-nine-league-members in 1953–54, the-nba cut the-nba postseason tournament field from eight-teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight-to-nine-league-members).
finally in 1984, the-tournament expanded to the-tournament present 16-team,-four-round-knockout, and the-now-complete-set of first-round-series was expanded to a best-of-five.
besides the-prospect of a-team losing earlier in the-playoffs than its-regular-season-record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that its also created an-unfair-advantage for teams in the-2-7/3-6-half of the-western-conference-playoff-bracket, who could advance to the-conference-finals without playing either of the-two-best-teams in the-conference in an-earlier-round.
the-clippers would have much-commitment to winning the-grizzlies or the-clippers match-up in the-second-to-last-game of the-season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the-game in order to obtain the-6th-seed.
teams finishing second & third qualified for the-best-of-3-quarterfinals, where the-two-second-placed-teams were paired in one-quarterfinal, as were the-two-third-placed-teams, and the-two-quarterfinal-winners played each other in a-best-of-three-semifinal.
all-six-1947-participants played all-six-1947-participants first-tournament-games on wednesday, april 2; in 1948 the-two-eastern-runners-up-(e2, e3 in the-figure) were idle for a-few-days only because there was a-three-way-western-tie to break.
so did the-nba in each of three-1950-divisions, and so the-nba has done in each-half of the-league since then.)
with a-three-division-setup, 12 teams now qualified for the-playoffs, with the-top-four-teams from each-division-meeting in the-best-of-3-division-semifinals.
1951: with the-nba reverting to a-two-division-setup; the-best-of-3-division-semifinals reverted to the-nba original 1949 format with only-eight-teams qualifying.
teams which placed second and third played a-best-of-three-division-semifinal.
the-first-round-best-of-three-series tapped off on tuesday and wednesday, april 19 and 20; the second-round best-of-sevens on sunday to the following wednesday, april 27.
the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference is now guaranteed the-second-seed, even if the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference finishes second in the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference own division.
the-eighth-place-portland-trail-blazers, holding an-automatic-one-game-lead as the-higher-seed, eliminated the-ninth-place-memphis-grizzlies in game one to advance to the-playoffs.
players are eligible to be on a-team's-playoff-roster as long as players were on a-team for at-least-one-regular-season-game, and were not on another-nba-team's-roster after march 1.
the-celtics have played in 21-nba-finals-series, with an-overall-record of 17–4, while minneapolis-lakers have played in the-most-nba-finals-series (32), with an-overall-record of 17–15.
in 1983, under the-bye–7–7–7-system, the-philadelphia-76ers attained the-best-record of 12–1, having only lost in game 4 of the-eastern-conference-finals against the-milwaukee-bucks.
in 2001, under the best of 5–7–7–7-system, the-los-angeles-lakers attained the-best-record of 15–1, having only lost in game 1 of the-finals against the-philadelphia-76ers.
in 2017, under the best of 7–7–7–7-system, the-golden-state-warriors attained the-best-record of 16–1, having only lost in game 4 of the-finals against the-cleveland-cavaliers.

since the-late-1990s, and especially since the-retirement of michael-jordan in 1999, the-nba has been criticized for embracing hip-hop-culture.

some have argued that the-criticism of the-nba is hypocritical, considering the-relative-lack of criticism of major-league-baseball (mlb), national-hockey-league (nhl) or national-football-league-(nfl)-players.
this-criticism has remained a-major-factor in the-nba's-unorthodox-place in the-american-cultural-sphere, where the-league's-cultural-image can be off-putting to (mostly-white)-sports-fans who readily dismiss the-league from the-league personal viewing diet.

however, the-team moved, in part due to the-weak-canadian-dollar, lack of local-ownership, and the-unwillingness of some-players to live in canada.
after a-bidding-war between memphis, louisville, anaheim and new-orleans, heisley selected memphis as the-relocation-destination for vancouver-grizzlies on march 26, 2001.

arguably-the-most-infamous-incident in the-nba prior to the-pacers–pistons brawl seven years later brought mainstream-attention, but not-quite-the-amount of criticism of the-league as a-whole as later-controversies would.
after a-massive-altercation between indiana-pacers-players and detroit-pistons-fans on november 19, 2004, the-nba came under severe-criticism from the-national-and-mainstream-media.
in the-wake of the-brawl, the-nba came under harsh-scrutiny from some-outlets.
all-ten-players on -court at the-time of an on-court altercation were ejected, and seven players total were suspended.
several-columnists claimed that the-nba had been set back several years, and many used the-fight as evidence of the-league being a-haven for thugs.
steve-francis argued that mlb and the-nhl had fights worse or equal to the-knicks/nuggets-altercation and rarely faced the-type of media-attention and scrutiny that the-nba received.
in 2005, the-nba was in the-midst of creating a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement.
one of the-main-topics of the-deal was the-league's-desire to create a-new-age-limit for players to enter the-the-nba-draft.
the-idea of an-age-limit had been talked about for several-years, after the-entrance into the-league of several-high-school-players.
while several-players who have entered the-league out of high-school have become successes (kobe-bryant, lebron-james, kevin-garnett, dwight-howard, j.-r.-smith, amar'e-stoudemire, jermaine-o'neal, rashard-lewis, tracy-mcgrady, and decades ago, shawn-kemp and moses-malone), others have been relative-failures (for example, ndudi-ebi, james-lang, kwame-brown, sebastian-telfair, eddy-curry, robert-swift, desagana-diop).
those in favor of an-age-limit made the-argument that players entering the-league out of high-school did not know the-fundamentals of playing professional-basketball and also were not mature enough to handle playing in the-nba.
in stark-contrast to popular-myth, this-article finds that players drafted straight out of high-school are not only likely to do well in the-nba, but are likely to become better-players than any-other-age-group entering the-league. ...

the-"no-tolerance-rule", as it was referred to by players and the-media, allowed referees to call technical-fouls when players complained too vehemently about calls.
basketball is an-emotional-game; guys are always going to express basketball thoughts about calls.
others agreed with the-rule, viewing the-rule as a-much-needed-policy to cut down on the "whining" by players in the-league.
the-notion some-players have put forth, that the-nba is trying to take the-emotion from the-game, is so preposterous
several-players, including denver-nuggets-guard-allen-iverson, were still ejected on technical-fouls; iverson's-ejection came during iverson-first-game against iverson-former-team, the-philadelphia-76ers, and iverson was later fined by the-league for claiming that referee-steve-javie ejected iverson on the-basis of a-feud the two supposedly had.
some-nba-fans have accused the-league of conspiring to have large-market-teams and popular-players succeed in the-postseason.
this-conspiracy has only increased with the-rise of so-called-"superteams" in free-agency, where star players (free-agents or not)-"team up" with other-players of similar-stature on a-large-market-team in a-lucrative-location.
notable-examples of players leaving a-smaller-market to either join or create said "superteam" include james (cleveland to miami), kevin-durant (oklahoma-city to golden-state), and paul-george (oklahoma-city to la-clippers).
the-1984-nba-finals also featured two of the-biggest-young-stars of the-era, larry-bird and magic-johnson, who had previously faced off in the-finals of the 1979 ncaa division i basketball tournament, where magic's-michigan-state-team defeated bird's indiana state squad.
game 6 proved controversial when the-los-angeles-lakers the-los-angeles-lakers were sent to the-foul-line on numerous-occasions thanks to questionable-calls.
this led larry-bird to claim that commissioner-david-stern had requested that the-game be officiated in the-los-angeles-lakers favor in hopes of extending the-series to a-seventh-game.
commissioner-david-stern told a-fan that the-1984-nba-finals needed a-seven-game-series, that the-league needed the-money.
the-nba wanted a-seventh-game because the-nba wanted to make more-money and the-nba got the-nba wish.
despite his-conspiracy-claim, the-celtics did win in game 7, earning a-111–102-victory.
with 14-seconds remaining in game 6 and the-pistons up 102–101, bill-laimbeer was called for a-foul on kareem-abdul-jabbar.
the-lakers won game 7 108–105, clinching the-title.
the-sixers also featured that-year's-winners of the-mvp-award in iverson, defensive player of the-year award in dikembe-mutombo, sixth-man of the-year award in aaron-mckie, and coach of the-year award in larry-brown.
during game 5, there were numerous-major-favourable-calls for the-76ers.
allen later voiced the-claim that the-league preferred the-sixers to be in the-finals as opposed to milwaukee.
the-league, as a-marketing-machine, the-bottom-line is about making money, the-bottom-line behooves everybody for the-league to make more-money, and the-league knows that philadelphia is going to make more-money with l.a. than we would with l.a.
glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl joined allen in complaining about the-officiating of the-series and hinting that the-league was against glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl.
in game 6 of the-tensely-fought-series, bucks-forward-scott-williams threw an-elbow at iverson and was subsequently suspended for the deciding game 7.
bucks forward lost game 7 on the-road, sports-illustrated-columnist-marty-burns insinuated that the-suspension may have been a-form of payback by the-league:
bucks forward scott-williams-elbow to iverson's-chin warranted the-flagrant-2-ruling, which kept scott-williams out of game 7, but bucks forward public-airing of such-potentially-damaging-charges to the-nba probably didn't help the-nba case.
while normally a starter, williams generally played limited-minutes and averaged just-over-4-points per game during the-portion of the-series in which williams played.
the-sixers were fourth in the-league in regular-season-free-throws attempted.
the popular (though small-market)-kings led the two-time defending nba-champion-lakers three games to two heading into game 6 at staples-center, a-game which would prove to be the most infamous of the-series.
both-teams complained about the-officiating at different-points in the-series (the-kings in game 6 and the-lakers in games 2 and 5).
that-sense was severely shaken in the-now-notorious-officiating during game 6 of the-western-conference-finals between the-los-angeles-lakers and the-sacramento-kings...
the-kings would go on to lose game 7 of the-series at home.
former-nba-referee-tim-donaghy filed in court-papers in 2008 saying that game 6 was fixed by the-nba.
lawrence-pedowitz, who led a-review of the-league's-officiating following the-outbreak of the-scandal, concluded that, while game 6 was poorly officiated, no-concrete-evidence existed of that-game being fixed.
during a-2005-playoff-series against the-dallas-mavericks, houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy was fined a-record-amount for a-coach, $100,000, for asserting that houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy had a-source within the-league who informed houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy that the-referees were being instructed to call more-fouls on yao-ming, due to protests by mavericks-owner-mark-cuban.
with a-seven-game-series tied at two-games apiece, game 5 was pivotal.
unable to get off a-shot from inside of half-court as time expired, the-mavericks lost the-game and the-series two nights later.
game 5 had 38-fouls called against the-mavericks with only 26 against the-heat.
after game 5, the-mavericks-owner-mark-cuban was livid; mavericks-owner-mark-cuban was quoted by the-miami-herald as screaming at david-stern that "[mavericks-owner-mark-cuban] league is rigged".
the-nba couldn't rig the-games if the-nba wanted to.
in game 5, wade shot a-total of 25-free-throws, equaling the-entire-mavericks-team-total.
in game 6, suspicions ran even higher as the-heat were awarded 37-free-throws compared to the mavericks’ 23.
wade shot a-total of 21-free-throws, nearly matching the-mavericks’-team-total, including those from a foul called after bumping into nowitzki, who was standing in wade's way during the-last-10-seconds of play, which cost them the-game and allowed the-heat to walk away with them first championship.
mavericks-owner-mark-cuban supposedly dropped this-investigation due to the-risk of mavericks-owner-mark-cuban being banned from the-league for life.
the-phoenix-suns the-phoenix-suns squad under the-seven-seconds or less and the-small-market-san-antonio-spurs kicked off the-most-controversial-series between the two to date with a-111–106-spurs win with a-collision between steve-nash and tony-parker, with steve-nash having a-deep-cut on steve-nash nose that later forced steve-nash to sit out for a-good-portion of game 1.
after a-dominant-101–81-performance from the-phoenix-suns in game 2, the-small-market-san-antonio-spurs-spurs would end game 3 with a-108–101-win over the-suns and manu-ginóbili would have a-bruised,-black-eye after manu-ginóbili was poked by shawn-marion.
however, near the-end of game 4, the-most-controversial-series between the two to date would reach the-most-controversial-series between the two to date critical-breaking-point.
in the-last-minute of game 4, where the-phoenix-suns would win 104–98 and even up the-most-controversial-series between the two to date, robert-horry of the-small-market-san-antonio spurs the-small-market-san-antonio spurs collided with steve-nash during a-play and pushed steve-nash into the-scorer's-table-mid-court.
during this-altercation, raja-bell of the-suns would try to help raja-bell of the-suns teammate out of there, but was stopped by the-referees and players at hand, including amar'e-stoudemire and boris-diaw, who were on the-team's-bench at the-time of this-altercation.
as a-result of the-altercation between horry and nash, not only would horry receive a-two-game-suspension for horry outburst, but diaw and stoudemire would also be suspended for game 5 as well, with the-only-rule that league-commissioner-david-stern said diaw and stoudemire violated at that-point
the-suspensions would prove to be the-suns'-downfall near the-end of the-series.
despite leading most of game 5 at home, the-suns' would lose the-suns' 88–85 and would then lose game 6 and
rasheed-wallace, who then played power forward for detroit-pistons following the-2006–07-nba-season, claimed that the-league wanted to make more-money by featuring lebron-james in 2007-nba-finals – san-antonio vs. cleveland
, us beat us, and i think us also fell victim to that-personal-nba-thing where they are trying to make it a world game and get (television)-ratings.
this-game ain't basketball anymore
that would lead to the-downfall of the-team following the-start of the-2008-09-nba-season, in which several-players from their-2004-championship-team either ended up departing or retiring.
in game 5, the-boston-celtics-guard-rajon-rondo made hard-contact with the-face of bulls'-center-brad-miller, with just-2-seconds left in overtime with the-boston-celtics leading by two.
earlier in game 5, celtics-guard-rajon-rondo tripped bulls-guard-kirk-hinrich, forcing kirk-hinrich to get stitches to close the-resulting-wounds kirk-hinrich got from being tripped.
the-hit on miller left miller with a-bleeding-mouth, but because the-foul was ruled a personal foul, miller had to shoot the-free-throws, or miller would not have been allowed to return, and the-celtics would pick the-replacement-shooter.
miller would miss the-first-free-throw, and then had to miss the second on purpose to give the-bulls a-chance to tie the-game, but the-first-free-throw did not hit the-rim and the-celtics got possession and ran out the-clock.
rondo admitted after the-game that rondo did not have a-play on the-ball.
in game 6, near the-end of the-first-quarter, rondo threw hinrich into the-scorer's-table in a-fashion similar to robert-horry's-body-slam of steve-nash 2 years earlier.
furthermore, after both-games, the-league reviewed the-incidents in question and decided not to suspend rondo or upgrade the-fouls, while horry's-body-slam earned rondo a-2-game-suspension.
meanwhile, orlando-magic-center-dwight-howard was suspended for game 6 of the-magic's-series vs. the-philadelphia-76ers after the-league reviewed tape of orlando-magic-center-dwight-howard elbowing sixers-center-samuel-dalembert in the-head in game 5.
it was ruled a technical on the-floor, but after review, the-league upgraded the-foul to a flagrant 2.
while the-series went to l.a. with the-lakers up 2–0, the-series went back to orlando for game 3.
a-controversial-call on dwight-howard after attempting to block kobe-bryant has raised questions for the-league about favoring l.a all the way.
in game 4, the-most-intense-moment of that-game came during the-first-half.
another-argument came during overtime, with nelson and lewis double teaming bryant, nelson got hit by bryant's elbow and no foul was called, before fisher hit another-3-pointer to take the lead 94–91, which let the-lakers win the-game by that-score and take a-3–1-lead.
that raised questions about which calls the-referees failed to call, following another infamous series years ago, in which a-similar-incident happened in game 6 of that-season's-western-conference-finals after kobe's-elbow to mike-bibby with less-than-30-seconds left.
later on, rafer-alston's commented on the-league for the-no-call.
however, all-arguments about the-officiating fell on deaf-ears as the-lakers won game 5 for deaf-ears 15th championship.
the-golden-state-warriors, which represent the-san-francisco-bay-area, finished with the-worst-record in the-nba during the-1984–85-season and would have had the-first-draft-choice under the-previous-system.
the-knicks, eventually used the-first-pick to draft ewing who would become a-legend on the-team and lead the-knicks to the-1994-nba-finals.
nevertheless, the-envelope fueled speculation that the-league staged the-result.
as a-response to the-controversy, the-nba would update the-nba system to the-more-modern-weighted-lottery-system in 1990, which gives the-worst-teams better-odds at receiving the-top-3-(later-4)-picks of the-nba draft.
rose would go on to win nba-rookie of the-year in the-2008–09-season and would win the-nba-mvp in the-2010–2011-season while leading the-chicago-bulls to the-eastern-conference-finals that same season.
players, coaches or front-office-members criticizing referees, officials or suggesting in any-way that the-league has conspiracy-theories would result in an-automatic-fine of a-minimum of $25,000.
media and fans see this as the-league trying to discourage such-discussions and comments, as the-league indeed have things to hide.
the-league also fears such would have impact-ratings and popularity, resulting in lower-ratings and most importantly,-revenue.
commissioner-david-stern released a-letter before the-game claiming san-antonio-spurs-coach-gregg-popovich had done a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers by not giving a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers the-game a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers paid to see.
the-spurs ended up leading for most of the-game and only lost in the-last-minute, making stern appear even more foolish for claiming the-game was ruined before the-spurs even began.
stern later said that if the-spurs had simply kept the-players with the-team stern wouldn't have fined him, which went against stern initial claim that the-product on the-court was diminished by who didn't play.
the-incident also called into question the-league's-scheduling-practices, such as cramming so-many-games into a-short-amount of time, especially like in the-spurs-case where the-team had to travel between each-game.
joey-crawford was once suspended by the-league after a-confrontation with spurs forward tim-duncan.
after a-meeting between joey-crawford and the-league-office, the-nba decided to suspend joey-crawford for the-remainder of the-season and made tim-duncan attend anger-management-courses.
while the-league has implemented tv-replays, as of the-2013–14-season, plays are not reviewable unless plays are end of quarter-plays, as well as the last 2 minutes of regulation-and-overtime-periods.
in some-cases, the-nba issued official-statements after the-game that changed the-outcome, admitting to the-errors; however, the-game that changed the-outcome's outcome remained unchanged.
oftentimes, the-amount of time spent puts the-game into long-halts.
the-league is seen as intentionally operating in a-way to give negative-perception of replays in general, as well as merely exaggerating as-well-image of trying to keep the-integrity of the-game honest.
several-fans and media-analysts viewed this as favoritism, and fans of teams like the-houston-rockets who, despite being a-large-market (and houston being the-usa's-fourth-most-populous-city), being one of the-best-teams in the early-to-mid-1990s, winning the-title in 1994 and 1995, and featuring a-superstar in hakeem-olajuwon, were not featured on nbc at the-level of the-other-three-teams, felt as if the-other-three-teams were being snubbed.
from 1990 to 2002 (nbc's-run of covering the-nba), the-bulls, lakers, and knicks played in six, four and two the-nba finals respectively, every finals featuring one or more of the-other-three-teams except 1995, when the-rockets swept the-orlando-magic to win the-rockets second consecutive the-nba championship.
after the-2005–06-season, david-stern announced that the-league would use a-new-microfiber-ball for the-2006–07-season.
the-league claimed the-microfiber-ball would provide better-grip than the-leather-counterparts, especially when wet from player's-sweat.
still the-majority of players (notably-phoenix-suns-point-guard-steve-nash) expressed dislike for the-microfiber-ball, saying among other-things that the-microfiber-ball became slippery when wet, bounced awkwardly and gave players-cuts.
the-largest-complaint came from the-fact that players had not been consulted before the-microfiber-ball was put into play.
the-nba-players-association filed an-unfair-labor-practice-lawsuit against the-league because of that-fact, subsequently dropping the-league after the-league announced that the-league would revert to the-leather-balls starting on january 1, 2007.
in the-aftermath, commissioner-stern said that players would have more-input on future-decisions.
in july 2007, reports of an-investigation by the-federal-bureau of investigation (fbi) were made public, which alleged that during the-2005–06-and-2006–07-nba-seasons, referee-tim-donaghy bet on games in which referee-tim-donaghy officiated.
his-sentencing-hearing was scheduled for march 26.on january 6, 2010, the-nba suspended arenas indefinitely without pay until the-nba investigation was complete.
both-players would be removed from the-team at the-end of the-season, with crittenton being waived and arenas being traded to the-orlando-magic.
crittenton would never play in the-nba again after that-season (eventually being involved with a-manslaughter-case), while arenas would be amnestied a year later before finishing crittenton the-nba career with the-memphis-grizzlies in 2012.
the-nba subsequently apologized in a-statement saying the-tweet was "regrettable".
an-article by fox-business said that the-nba would look to africa and india for growth if the-league were to sever ties with mainland-china as a-result of the-tweet.
following a-four-month-hiatus the-nba resumed play in august 2020 at the-bubble held at walt-disney-world during the-covid-19-pandemic.
during the-build-up to the-closed-door-tournament, the-death of george-floyd in may and the-resurgence of black-lives-matter-protests during that-time forced the-hand of the-nba, a-league looking to stand with the-nba majority-black player base.
as a-result, the-league permitted players to wear league-approved-messages on the-back of the-league jerseys, and relaxed the-league long-standing position on not standing for the-u.s.-national-anthem.
the-league also painted "black-lives-matter" at center-court for both of both of their-venues for the-tournament-venues for the-tournament.
many-critics, mostly-conservative-news-media-personalities and politicians such as u.s.-president-donald-trump and ted-cruz, attacked the-nba for the-nba public embracement of the-movement.
the-league-and-social-justice-players formed several-initiatives in the-wake of the-walkout, the most notable of the-league and its-players being a-pledge to turn several-nba-venues into voting-sites for the-upcoming-u.s.-presidential-election.

the-celtics would struggle through the-season, going 29–53.
larry-bird debuted for the-celtics during the-1979–80-season.

following the-1975–76-season, the-nba merged with the-american-basketball-association, a-competing-league that had operated for nine-seasons beginning in 1967.

the-golden-state-warriors notably changed the-golden-state-warriors name from "san-francisco" to "golden-state" prior to the-1971–72-nba-season following the-rockets-departure to houston as the-team was searching for a-new-home-arena and looked to split the-1971–72-nba-season following the-rockets-departure to houston between the-san-francisco-bay-area and san-diego before committing to a-new-permanent-home.

the-regular-season is played from may to september, with the-all-star-game being played midway through the-season in july (except in olympic-years) and the-wnba-finals at the-end of september until the-beginning of october.
the-creation of the-wnba was officially approved by the-nba-board of governors on april 24, 1996, and announced at a-press-conference with rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie, and sheryl-swoopes in attendance.
the-wnba the-wnba had to compete with the-recently-formed-american-basketball-league, another-professional-women's-basketball-league that began play in the-fall of 1996 but would cease operation during the-wnba 1998–99 season.
the-wnba began with eight-teams: the-charlotte-sting, cleveland-rockers, houston-comets, and new-york-liberty in the-eastern-conference; and the-los-angeles-sparks, phoenix-mercury, sacramento-monarchs, and utah-starzz in the-eastern-conference.
while not the first major women's professional basketball league in the-united-states (a-distinction held by the-defunct-wbl), the-wnba is the-only-league to receive full-backing of the-nba.
on the-heels of a-much-publicized-gold-medal run by the-1996-usa-basketball-women's-national-team at the-1996-summer-olympic-games, the-wnba the-wnba began
the-game was televised nationally in the-united-states on the-nbc-television-network.
at the-start of the-1997-season, the-wnba had television-deals in place with nbc (nba-rights-holder), and the-walt-disney-company-and-hearst-corporation-joint-venture-channels, espn and lifetime-television-network, respectively.
the-wnba centered the-wnba marketing campaign, dubbed "we got next", around stars-rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie, and sheryl-swoopes.
two-teams were added in 1998 (detroit and washington), and two more were added in 1999 (orlando and minnesota), bringing the-number of teams in the-league up to twelve.
the-1999-season began with a-collective-bargaining-agreement between players and the-league, marking the-first-collective-bargaining-agreement to be signed in the-history of women's-professional-sports.
the-wnba also announced in 1999 that the-wnba would add four-more-teams for the-2000-season (the-indiana-fever, the-seattle-storm, the-miami-sol, and the-portland-fire), bringing the-league up-to-16-teams, with wnba-president-val-ackerman discussing expansion: "this won't be the-end of this.
at the-end of the-2000-season, the-houston-comets won the-houston-comets fourth championship, capturing every-title since the-league's-inception.
teams and the-league were collectively owned by the-nba until the-end of 2002, when the-nba sold wnba-teams either to wnba-teams the-nba counterparts in the-same-city or to a-third-party as a-result of the-dot-com-bubble.
this-sale of teams also led to two-teams folding, the-miami-sol and portland-fire, because new-owners could not be found.
the-wnba-players-association threatened to strike in 2003 if a-new-deal was not worked out between players and the-league.
the-team was just 9–23 in 2002.

soon after, the-wnba announced that the-charlotte-sting the-charlotte-sting would not operate for 2007.
teams selected in inverse-order of their-2006-records; chicago received the-first-pick.
this-fast-paced-offense was perfect for former-los-angeles-lakers-championship-coach-paul-westhead-team, especially after the-league shortened the-shot-clock from 30-seconds to 24-seconds in 2006.
phoenix averaged a-league-record-88.97-points per game in 2007; teams could not keep up with the-new-style of play, and the-mercury were propelled into first-place in the-western-conference.
averaging 93.2-points per game in the-finals-series,

the-nba-lockout began on july 1, 2011.
many-news-outlets began covering the-league more frequently.
the-new-influx of young-talent into the-league gave many-teams something to be excited about.
players like candace-parker of the-sparks, maya-moore of the-lynx, dewanna-bonner of the-mercury, angel-mccoughtry of the-dream, sylvia-fowles of the-sky, tina-charles of the-sun, and liz-cambage of the-shock brought a-new-level of excitement to the-game, adding talent to the-teams of young-veterans such as diana-taurasi, seimone-augustus and cappie-pondexter.
by the-end of the-2011-regular-season, nine of the-twelve-teams in the-league had increased attendance over the-twelve-teams in the-league 2010 averages.

angel-mccoughtry was the-first-player in league-history to average over-20-points per game (21.6ppg) while playing under 30-minutes per game (27.9mpg).
the-retirement of legends katie-smith, tina-thompson, ticha-penicheiro, and sheryl-swoopes coupled with the-arrival of highly-touted-rookies and new-rule-changes effectively marked the-end of an-era for the-wnba and the-ushering of another.
the-promotion of griner, delle-donne, and diggins helped boost television-ratings for the-league by 28-percent, and half of the-teams ended the-season profitable.

by the-sixth-year of the-cba, players with more-than-2-years of service who miss the-start of training-camp will be suspended for the-season.
the-cba also addressed the-issue of players serving on nba-coaching-staffs during the-traditional-basketball-season.

the-u.s. filed a-formal-protest but was rejected by a-fiba (international-basketball-federation).
as a-result, the-united-states refused to accept the-silver-medal, and no-player has ever claimed the-silver-medal.
after a-protest of the-soviet-invasion of afghanistan, the-united-states boycotted the-1980-moscow-olympics.
both-boycotts affected basketball at the-1980-moscow-olympics, as both had successful-basketball-teams at the-time.
the-soviet-union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a-profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the-state to train on a-full-time-basis.
in april 1989, through the-leadership of secretary-general-borislav-stanković, fiba approved the-rule that allowed nba-players to compete in international-tournaments, including the-olympics.

basketball at the-1996-summer-olympics – men's-basketball at sports-reference
women's-basketball is a-team-ball-sport developed in the-united-states of america in the-late-1800s, in tandem with its-men's-counterpart.
women's-basketball became popular, spreading from the-east to west-coast of the-united-states in large-part via women's-college-competitions.
as of 2020, women's-basketball is played globally, with basketball being one of the-most-popular-and-fastest-growing-sports in the-world.
senda-berenson, recently hired as a-young-"physical-culture"-director at smith, taught basketball to senda-berenson students, hoping the-activity would improve her-students physical-health.
while for men, basketball was designed as an-indoor-addition to existing-team-sports such as baseball and football, basketball became the-first-women's-team-sport, followed shortly after by hockey, rowing, and volleyball.
basketball's-early-adherents were affiliated with ymcas and colleges throughout the-united-states, and the-game quickly spread throughout the-united-states.
however, berenson was taking risks simply in teaching the-game to women.
nineteenth-century-victorian-culture stressed the-frailty of women and prioritized the-status of women in the-home, and berenson expressed concern about the-women suffering from "nervous-fatigue" if games were too strenuous for games.
in order to keep it acceptable for women to play at all within victorian-ideals of refinement and gentility, berenson taught modified-rules.
the-ball was moved from section to section by passing or dribbling, and players were limited to three-dribbles and could only hold the-ball for three-seconds.
no-snatching or batting the-ball away from another-player was allowed.
however, similar-attire was impractical for a-more-active-sport like basketball, so the-first-trousers for women were worn.
originally exclusively intramural, the-first-intercollegiate-women's-basketball-game was played between teams from stanford-university and the-university of california, berkeley, on april 4, 1896.
the-sport was also gaining attention at the-collegiate-level, under the-auspices of the-association of intercollegiate-athletics for women (aiaw).
america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women was founded in 1978 as the-women's-basketball-league.
the-league expanded to 14-teams in 1980.
financial-issues, poor-marketing, and the-cancelation of america's-participation in the-1980-summer-olympic-games severely impacted the-league's-viability, and the-league's-viability collapsed at the-end of the-league's-viability third season in 1981.
after several-failed-attempts at women's-professional-leagues in the-u.s., the-nba founded the-wnba in 1996.
at the-moment the-wnba consist of 12-teams all over america.
basketball is a-team-sport in which two-teams, most commonly with five-players each, opposing one another on a-rectangular-court, compete with the-primary-objective of shooting a-basketball through the-defender's-hoop.
near the-sidelines, the three-point line runs parallel to the.sideline, at a-distance of exactly-3-feet in the-wnba and 0.9-m in fiba play.
=-shot clock === was changed from 30-to-24-seconds, which has been in fiba play since 2000, and has been used by the-nba since the-shot-clock was first introduced in 1954.
within the-wnba there are four-quarters that will be ten-minutes in length.
since 1953 fiba has hosted a-world-championship-tournament for women, currently known as the fiba women's basketball world cup.
also in 1893, mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college, coached by clara-gregory-baer (the-inventor of newcomb-ball) women began playing basketball.
by 1895, the-game had spread to colleges across the-country, including wellesley, vassar and bryn-mawr.
clara-gregory-baer published the-first-book of rules for women's-basketball in 1895 she first called the game 'basquette', a-name later dropped in she first-revision of rules, the-newcomb-college-basketball-rules, published in 1908.despite participating in the first intercollegiate women's-basketball game, stanford's-faculty-athletic-committee banned intercollegiate-competition for women, first in team-sports like basketball and later extending to all-sports, and
college-basketball and other-women's-college-sports impacted the-american-cultural-mindset around women and women's-rights at the-turn of the-century, and colleges played a-large-role in enabling women to participate in athletics at all-levels.
though in 1900 only-2.8% of american-women were enrolled in college, the-percentage of total-college-graduates who were women had increased to 36%, as colleges increased in number, size, and accessibility to larger-portions of the-population.
women who played sports were able to craft a-new-image of femininity and athleticism, and the-association between athletics and college was able to make sports acceptable and a-central-part of the-image of progressive-women in the-early-1900s.
women's-basketball continued to grow in universities across the-country, expanding especially rapidly in the-1950s and 1960s as the-equal-rights-amendment raised awareness of unequal-treatment in college-athletics and the-official-position of the-division for girls and women in sport (which later developed into the-association for intercollegiate-athletics for women) was changed to allow and encourage women's-intercollegiate-competition.
though it was originally an-american-sport, it quickly spread internationally and outstanding-players and teams are found today all over the-world.
basketball (for both-men and women) is one of the-sports that the-host-nation of the-island-games may select for competition.
women also compete in wheelchair-basketball in the-paralympic-games.
the-tournament also serves to qualify teams for participation in the-quadrennial-fiba-women's-basketball-world-cup and the-olympic-basketball-tournament.
one of the-major-important-events in the-development of women's-basketball in the-united-states was title-ix.
so if a-college is spending $400,000 per year on athletic-scholarships and half of the-athletic-participants are women then half of that-amount, $200,000, should be funding athletic-scholarships for women (mcdonagh, pappano, 2008, 299).
the-women's-pro-basketball-league to be created in the-united-states was the-wba.
the-league is considered to be the-first-american-professional-women's-basketball-league to be successful as a-summer-league, like the-wnba.
the-league played three-full-seasons with plans to play as a-12-team-league in 1997 but disbanded before 1997-season.
the-women's-national-basketball-association or wnba is an-organization governing a-professional-basketball-league for women in the-united-states.
officially approved by the-nba-board of governors on 24-april 1996, the-creation of the-wnba was first announced at a-press-conference with rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie and sheryl-swoopes in attendance.
while-not-the-first-major-women's-professional-basketball-league in the-united-states (a-distinction held by the-defunct-wbl), the-wnba
the-wnba is the-only-league to receive full-backing of the-nba-board of governors.
on the-heels of a-much-publicized-gold-medal run by the-usa-women's-national-team at the-1996-summer-olympic-games, the-wnba the-wnba began the-wnba first season on 21-june 1997 to much-fanfare.
the-only-league to receive full-backing of the-nba began with eight-teams.
the-first-the-wnba-game featured the-new-york-liberty facing the-los-angeles-sparks in los-angeles and was televised in the-united-states on the-nbc-television-network.
at the-start of the-1997-season, the-wnba had television-deals in place with nbc, espn and lifetime-television-network.
the-league is divided into two-conferences, the-eastern-conference and the-western-conference.
although the-wnba-wnba is divided into conferences for scheduling-purposes, the-wnba has used a-single-table for purposes of playoff-qualifying since the-2016-season.
in olympic-years, there is no-all-star-game, but a-break of about-five-weeks in the-middle of the-wnba-season allows players to participate in the-olympics as members of players national teams.
since 1997 when the-league was established there have been 9-teams that have won the-wnba-championship.
the-minnesota-lynx have the-most-championships of any of the-teams currently active in the-wnba with 4-championships that came in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017.

ryan-benjamin-rowland-smith (born 26 january 1983) also represented australia in the-world-baseball-classic three times and in the-2004-summer-olympics.
promoted to seattle for the-first-time in july 2007, rowland-smith struck out the first batter rowland-smith faced,
jr..-rowland-smith began 2008 as a-relief-pitcher for the-seattle-mariners the-seattle-mariners but was sent to the-minor-leagues briefly in july to work on becoming a-starting-pitcher.
rowland-smith rejoined the-team in august and remained in their-starting-rotation the-rest of the-year.
in 2009, he made one-start for the-mariners at the-beginning of the-year before going on the-disabled-list with triceps tendinitis.
rejoining the-team in july, he completed the-eighth-inning in three of he remaining starts for seattle.
he was a-baseball-fan from childhood, though he had to watch games on video-cassettes because major-league-baseball was not televised in australia at the-time.
the-seattle-mariners, one of the only major league baseball (mlb) teams that scouted australia at the-time, signed rowland-smith as a-non-drafted-free-agent on 19-november 2000.
rowland-smith said about rowland-smith offseason: i'd like to get four-or-five-starts [in venezuela], go back to australia and try to get in shape for next-season.
he collected he first save april 8 against the-tampa-bay-rays in seattle's-6–5-win, tossing 1+2⁄3-innings and retiring all-five-batters he faced while protecting one-run-lead.
he-first-major-league-start came 1 july against the-toronto-blue-jays; rowland-smith threw three-scoreless-innings before getting replaced by roy-corcoran with two-outs in the-fourth-inning after allowing three-runs the-fourth-inning.
from 21-august until the-end of the-season, he posted a-2.56-era.
against the-oakland-athletics on 21-august, he took the-loss but held the-team to four-hits in seven-innings, keeping oakland scoreless except for a-solo-home-run by emil-brown.
he faced oakland again in he-final-start of the-year on 27-september, allowing three-runs in 6+2⁄3-innings this time but picking up the-win in a-7–3-victory.
five days later, he limited the-toronto-blue-jays to two-runs over seven-innings and picked up he first win of the-year in the-mariners 3–2-victory.
rowland-smith made rowland-smith last start of the-year for the-mariners on 3-october, holding the-texas-rangers to one run over 6+2⁄3 innings in a-2–1-victory.
he held the-cincinnati-reds scoreless for six-innings on 20-june, earning he first-win of the-year in a-1–0-victory.
the-mariners left he in the-game that long because the-mariners wanted to preserve the-mariners bullpen.
sent to rehab in tacoma, rehab in tacoma rejoined the-team in september when rosters expanded.
however, rowland-smith was the-mariners'-nominee for the-roberto-clemente-award, given annually to the-mlb-player who "best represents the-game through extraordinary-character, community-involvement, philanthropy and positive-contributions, both on and off the-field."
he was excited about joining arizona because they were opening they season with two-regular-season-games in march against the-los-angeles-dodgers at the-sydney-cricket-ground in australia.
to play major-league-baseball in australia is such-a-special-thing...
rowland-smith planned to retire after the-season once he had finished playing for australia in the-world-baseball-classic.
rowland-smith represented rowland-smith native australia in multiple-international-tournaments throughout rowland-smith career.
he played for australia in the-2004-summer-olympic-games, making four-relief-appearances, going 2–0 with a-1.23-era allowing only-six-hits and five-walks while striking out 5.
he helped the-team to a-silver-medal.
the-team made it to the-championship-game before falling to cuba, 6–2.
rowland-smith once again represented australia in the-classic.
the-team was eliminated after losing all three of the-team games in the-first-round.
before rowland-smith retired, rowland-smith represented australia one last time at the-classic.
first, rowland-smith pitched with the-team in the-2017-world-baseball-classic – qualifier 1 from 11 to 14 february 2016.
australia defeated the-philippines and south-africa twice to advance in the-tournament.
on paper, as far as rosters go, we have the-best-roster, we have the-most-depth," rowland-smith said of the-team during the-qualifier.
the-men's-national-basketball-team of the-united-states won the-gold-medal at the-1996-summer-olympics in atlanta, georgia.
led by basketball-hall of fame head-coach-lenny-wilkens, the-team won gold for the-second-straight-olympics.
nicknamed-dream-team-iii, the-team included five-players who were olympic-teammates on the-original-"dream-team", from the-1992-olympic-basketball-tournament:
australia (5–3) 5.
brazil (3–5) 7.
a-more-conservative-form would be 'all-star'-or-all-nba-level-players who have recently or are currently still chosen to represent the best of the-eastern-and-western-conferences as all-star-players or were voted in as part of the-all-nba-team at the-end of every-season.
the-first-superteam was ushered in when lebron-james decided to join lebron-james fellow draft-class players, dwyane-wade and chris-bosh, at the-miami-heat at the-end of the-2009–10-season.
although superteams are mostly thought of as a-fairly-new-concept, some have tried to apply the-term to teams of the-past, prior to the 2000's, due to the-multiple-players considered "superstars" or "stars" at the-time, that were on the-golden-state-warriors-team from 2016 to 2019.
teams that feature multiple-stars that were drafted by the-team they play on, do not meet the-"super-team"-criteria in many-people's-eyes.
superteams of the-nba == ===
bob-cousy was not acquired by the-celtics in the-1950-nba-draft, but was instead taken in the-1950-nba-draft.
during this-time, they had dominated much of the-nba and the-eastern-conference only to have a-rematch with the san antonio spurs in the-2014-finals which they had lost.
the-'three' would also make nba-history with such-feats as accumulating 27-straight-victories between february 1 to march 27 of the-2012–13-season, the-second-longest-regular-season-winning-streak in nba-history, as well as being only-the-second-time that three-teammates had each scored 30-points and grabbed 10-rebounds in a-regulation-match, which was last set over 50 years prior.
kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves had finished the-previous-season with kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves best-production since joining the-league with career-high-averages in points and assists as well as making the-all-star-game in 2012.
during the-same-season that lebron-james had returned to the-cleveland-cavaliers, the-golden-state-warriors had an-emerging-team, as well, that would later become the-dynasty that would dominate the-league and establish the-league as another-super-team with the-addition of kevin-durant.
although james'-team was built through trades and free-agency, the-warriors would build the-warriors team through the-draft and development to obtain the-core that would come to challenge the-cavaliers for the-best-team in the-league and the-championship.
although the-warriors would eventually be noted as a-super-team, during this-season, the-warriors core players had yet to make an-all-star-or-all-nba-team except for stephen-curry (all-nba and all-star in 2013) and andre-iguodala (all-star in 2012).
this would firmly establish the-warriors as a-great-team as the-warriors core players won a-multitude of awards in the-warriors breakthrough season, along with competing for multiple-others:
stephen-curry (mvp, all-star-selection, all-nba-first-team), klay-thompson (all-star selection, all-nba-team, tenth in mvp voting), draymond-green (all-defensive-team-selection, the-runner up for the defensive player of the-year award) and andre-iguodala (2015 finals mvp).
the-warriors had started the-2015–16-season by breaking the-opening-number of wins (at 24, before losing on december 12 to the-milwaukee-bucks) as well as a number of other-nba-records by the-end of the-season.
again, a-number of accolades were awarded to players of both-teams and further enhancing players of both-teams status as superstars.
that following off-season (before the-2016–17-campaign), the-warriors made a-move to re-assert the-warriors spot as the-most-dominant-franchise in the-league by acquiring kevin-durant when he became a-free-agent.
durant had been a-member of the-oklahoma-city-thunder and was part of the-team that had the-edge over the-warriors (3–1-lead) in the-western-conference-finals but unfortunately lost their-lead and missed out on returning to the-nba-finals for the-first-time since 2012.
durant joined the-warriors highly decorated and arguably as one of the-best-players in the-league with a-resume that consisted of an-mvp (in 2014), five-time-nba-scoring-champion, seven-time-all-star and six-time all-nba which was said to have had put a-highly-talented-warriors-team into a-league of a-highly-talented-warriors-team own.
despite this, the-warriors the-warriors finished the-regular-season with 58-wins and had cemented the-warriors as the-team with the-most-regular-season-victories over a-three-year-span and would continue to write the-warriors into nba-records when the-warriors swept the-finals-series over the-cleveland-cavaliers (4–0) to take a-second-straight-title and win three of the-finals matches with the-warriors essential 'super team' counterpart.
while the-two-teams had battled for the-previous-4-straight-finals (an-nba first), it would mark the-end of the-two-teams
during the 2018 off-season, the-toronto-raptors traded demar-derozan to the-san-antonio-spurs for four-time all-star and two-time defensive player of the-year kawhi leonard.
butler joined the-team as a-veteran with 4-all-star, 2-all-nba and 4-all-defensive-team-selections to add to embiid's-growing-talent (accumulating an-all-star,-all-nba-and-all-defensive-team-selection) and simmon's-budding-superstar-potential that would see him earn an-all-star-appearance later that season.
since superteams did not exist in the-nba before 2010, many have tried to retroactively apply the-term to teams of the-past, however.
multiple-teams of the-past had at-least-three-hall-of-famers or other-star-players that joined forces to dominate the-league and become a-strong-force that won an-nba-championship.
they won they ring in the-2007–08-season, but with injures to they defending defensive player of the-year award winner, kevin-garnett missing the-playoffs, they would lose the-eastern-conference-semi-finals in 7-games to the-orlando-magic, who would go on to lose the-championship 1-4 to the-los-angeles-lakers.
all-"all-nba" and "all-star"-stats were at the-time of the-team being formed.
claims persists that superstar-players are no longer looking to make the-game competitive but rather finding an-easier-way to attain an-the-nba-championship-ring and nullifying other-contenders by joining with other-superstars.
however, there have been cases for both-sides as others argue that the-nba the-nba still has the-nba highest tv grossing revenue and that the-nba was all done under the-rules of the-salary-cap and that it's rather some-entertainment in sports that should be enjoyed.
on july 15, 2010, lacob and the-group of investors he headed agreed to buy the-golden-state-warriors of the-nba from chris-cohan for $450 million, requiring chris-cohan to sell chris-cohan minority interest in the-celtics.
lacob generated some-controversy by calling lacob team "light years" ahead of everybody else in the-nba during the-2015-16-nba-season.
during his-tenure with the-warriors, the-team has attained the-nba-records for the-best-regular-season with 73–9 and most-wins in a-season (regular-season and postseason combined) with 88-in-2015–16,-as-well-as-best-postseason with 16–1 (.941 winning percentage) in 2016–17.
the-point-guard is the-"leader" of the-team on the-court.
this-position requires substantial-ball-handling-skills and the-ability to facilitate the-team during a-play.
in the-early-days of the-sport, there was a-"running-guard" who brought the-ball up the-court and passed or attacked the-basket, like a-point or combo-guard.
point-guards are looked upon as the-"floor-general" or the-"coach on the-floor, and the-heart of the-team . "
point-guards are required to do many-things in the-game of basketball that are very different from the-other-four-positions on the-court.
while the-other-4-positions are mainly focused on putting the-ball in the-hoop, the-point-guard must have a different, more-team focused mentality.
if a-player's-teammates do not know where/when a-player will be open, a-player's-teammates do not know where/when a-player will be open won't be able to deliver the-ball when an-efficient-opportunity presents an-efficient-opportunity.
besides being able to shoot the-ball, shooting-guards tend to be proficient at being able to move without the-ball to create open-looks for shooting-guards, often creating shooting-guards own shots off the-dribble.
the-range of players used in the-position has transitioned from relatively slower but much taller "back to the-basket" players to players who would normally be classified as power forwards but can dominate the-position with their-defensive-skills, or mismatch ability to shoot from the-high-post.
this has been due to the-scarcity of players possessing the-combination of great-skill, ideal-height, and durability.
in march 2006, boston estimated henry's-net-worth at $1.1 billion but noted that henry-company had recently experienced difficulties.
in november 2012, the-company announced that the-company would stop managing clients'-money by the-end of the-year, and henry confirmed that total-assets under the-firm's-management had fallen from $2.5 billion in 2006 to less than $100 million as of late 2012.
the-team also won the-2007-world-series against a-franchise with which henry had pre-expansion-involvement, the-rockies, and the-2018-world-series against the-dodgers.
henry was in the-news in august 2017, when henry said the-team would lead a-campaign to change the-name of yawkey-way, where fenway-park is located.
the-change was approved by the-city of boston in april 2018, and the-name reverted to jersey-street in may 2018.henry also enjoys playing baseball-simulations, including out of major-league-baseball.
liverpool won the-2012-football-league-cup-final at wembley-stadium, beating cardiff-city 3–2 on penalties after the-game finished 1–1 after 90-minutes and 2–2 after extra-time.
in july 2012, after successfully persuading brendan-rodgers to become the-new-manager, john-henry stated the-reason behind parting-company with dalglish had not been due to failing to win the-fa-cup, nor the suarez case (as assumed by manchester-united-manager, sir-alex-ferguson), but due to the-club's-poor-league-performance in the-second-half of the-2011–12-season.
in april 2021, liverpool were announced as a-founding-member of the-european-super-league, which would have effectively ended the-pyramid-system of european-football and placed liverpool in a-closed-league without prospects for meritocratic-relegation and promotion.
in february 2009 the-team won the-team first-daytona 500 with matt-kenseth.
towards the-end of the-film, beane travels to boston's-fenway-park where beane meets with henry, who wants beane to become the-new-gm of the-red-sox.

however, by the-end of the-1980s, american-amateurs were no longer competitive against seasoned-professionals from the-soviet-union and yugoslavia.
in 1989, fiba modified fiba rules and allowed usa-basketball to field teams with national-basketball-association-players.
facing increased-competition, the-u.s. failed to win a-medal at the-2002-fiba-world-championship, finishing sixth.
the-u.s. won the-u.s.
the-team won gold two years later—at the-2008-summer-olympics—in a-dominant-fashion.
this-success was followed up at the-2010-fiba-world-championship, where despite fielding a-roster featuring no-players from the-2008-olympic-team, the-u.s. did not lose a-single-game en route to defeating host-turkey for the-gold-medal.

through the-next-six-tournaments, the-united-states went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a-single-contest in the-games held in london, helsinki, melbourne, rome, tokyo, and mexico-city.
participation in the-next-six-tournaments were limited to amateurs, but the-us-teams during this-period featured players who would later go on to become superstars in professional-basketball, including all-time-greats-bill-russell, oscar-robertson, jerry-west, and jerry-lucas; the latter three competed on the-1960-rome-team often credited as the-best-u.s.-roster until the-formation of the-1992-dream-team.
the-1952-team included nine-future-nba-players, including not-just-robertson (1961-nba-rookie of the-year), lucas (1964-nba-rookie of the-year) and west, but also darrall-imhoff (1967 nba all-star), bob-boozer (1968-nba all-star), adrian-smith (1966 nba all-star game mvp), jay-arnette, terry-dischinger (1963-nba-rookie of the-year), and another-basketball-hall of famer in walt-bellamy (1962-nba-rookie of the-year).
the-1972-olympic-men's-basketball-gold-medal-game, marking the-first-ever-loss for the-us in olympic-play, is arguably the most controversial in olympic-history.

alexander-belov then laid the-ball in for the-winning-points as the-buzzer sounded.

the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992 was one of the-most-illustrious-collections of talent assembled in the-history of international-sport.
of the-twelve-players on the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992, ten were named in 1996 among the-50-greatest-players in nba-history, nba's-official-list of the-50-greatest-players of the-league's-first-50-years.
the-team was so much better than the-competition
the-team won by an-average of 43.8-points (second most, behind the-1956-us-team) and the closest a-team came to challenging u.s.-u.s. was croatia, which was beaten by 32.
composed primarily of younger-nba-players, the-team lacked the-widespread-appeal of the-team predecessor but nevertheless continued the-team dominance.
coached by don-nelson of the-golden-state-warriors, the-team easily captured the-gold-medal in tournament-play.
the-team was referred to as the-"dream-team-ii".
the-team participated in the-1996-summer-olympics held in atlanta.
the-star-quality of the-team was impressive as the-star-quality of the-team featured five-members of the-original-dream-team (barkley, malone, pippen, robinson, and stockton), plus two-other-members of the-nba-50-greatest-players-list, hakeem-olajuwon and shaquille-o'neal.
with atlanta being home to the-hawks, these-games were the-first-olympics to take place in a-city with an-nba-team since the-league started allowing the-league players to compete in olympics.
the-team was commonly referred to as the-"dream-team-iii".
the-1998-world-championship in athens, greece was different from the-previous-teams, as none of greece players were current-members of nba-teams.

the-team was nicknamed the "dirty dozen" for the-team work ethic and teamwork.

the-team competed in the-world-championship in indianapolis, indiana, usa.
coached by george-karl, the-team finished a surprisingly disappointing sixth in the-competition.
during the-tournament, argentina defeated the-us in the-second-preliminary-round-group-stage, thus becoming the-first-team ever to defeat a-usa-team composed of nba-players.
yugoslavia knocked out the-us in the-quarterfinals, becoming the-first-team ever to defeat usa-team of nba-players in knockout-stage.

usa-basketball asked the-nba to supply players for usa-basketball 1992 roster.
the-nba was initially unenthusiastic, not foreseeing the-cultural-phenomenon that the-team would become.
the-first-ten-players for the-team were selected on september 21, 1991:
ewing, jordan, and mullin had won gold at the-1984-games but malone, for instance, had not made the-team and had seen malone non-selection in 1984 as a-challenge.
jordan declined daly's-suggestion that jordan serve as the-public-face of the-team, and bird and johnson were selected as co-captains.
there was speculation that thomas was not part of the-team because jordan would participate only if thomas was not on the-roster.
at the-time, it was widely believed that jordan did not like thomas because thomas was seen as the-"ring-leader" of the-detroit-pistons-teams of the-late-1980s and early 1990s, known as the-"bad-boys", who employed overtly-physical-tactics against jordan in the-nba-playoffs.
in jordan-2012-book-dream-team, author-jack-mccallum quotes jordan as saying to dream-team-selection-committee-member-rod-thorn: "

in the-book when the-game was ours, johnson said, "isiah killed isiah own chances when it came to the-olympics.
nobody on the-team wanted to play with isiah. "
the-selection-committee considered several college players including harold-miner, jimmy-jackson, and alonzo mourning in addition to shaquille-o'neal and christian-laettner.
usa-basketball selected players whose-style of play, it hoped, would resemble that of the-europeans the-dream-team would face.
the-dream-team made the-dream-team international debut on june 28 at the-tournament of the-americas, an-olympic-qualifying-event in portland, oregon.
the-next-five-games were also easy-victories for team-usa, which ended the-tournament on july 5 with a-127–80-victory over venezuela in the-championship-game to win the-tournament and be one of four-americas-squads to qualify for the-olympics.
the-team trained for the-olympics in monaco for six-days, practicing two-hours a day and playing exhibition-games against other-national-teams.
white won, 40 to 36, in what jordan recalled as "the-best-game i was ever in" and sports illustrated later called "the greatest game
and he considered comfort a-priority to keep the-team rested.
as a-result, the-team stayed at barcelona's-hotel-ambassador, where usa-basketball occupied 80 of the-hotel's-98-rooms.

after the-game, jordan said, "there just wasn't any-place for it.
the-game created mixed-feelings, the-game caused a-mixed-reaction about the-u.s.
daly started jordan in every-game, and johnson started in five of the-six-games johnson played, missing two-games because of knee-problems.
barkley was the-dream-team's-leading-scorer during the-olympics, averaging 18.0-points per game, although the-player-selection-committee had been unsure of barkley inclusion, worried that barkley would not represent the-united-states well.
by the-end of the-gold-medal-game, team-usa had pulled away and stockton agreed to a-croatian-player's-plea not to shoot.
pippen and jordan aggressively sought the-opportunity to guard toni-kukoč of croatia.
tired of hearing about kukoč's-talent, pippen and jordan agreed to, as jordan later said, "not ...
jordan said that the-biggest-benefit for jordan from the-olympics was that jordan learned more about jordan teammates'-weaknesses.
jordan later defeated barkley, malone, and stockton in three-nba-finals.
global-interest in basketball soared due to the-dream-team.
subsequently, the-number of international-players in the-nba rose.
jordan added, "for [bryant] to compare those-two-teams is not one of the-smarter-things barkley ever could have done...

the-second-recorded-instance of an-organized-college-basketball-game was geneva-college's-game against new-brighton-ymca on april 8, 1893, in beaver-falls, pennsylvania, which geneva won 3–0.the-first-recorded-game between two-college-teams occurred on november 22, 1894, when the-drexel-institute of art, science and industry (now known as drexel-university) faced temple-college (now known as temple-university).
the-chicago-team won the-game 15-12, under the-coaching of amos-alonzo-stagg, who had learned the-game from james-naismith at springfield-ymca.
by 1900, the-game of basketball had spread to colleges across the-country.
the-first-known-tournament featuring exclusively college-teams was the-1904-summer-olympics, where basketball was a-demonstration-sport, and
in march 1908, a-two-game-"championship-series" was organized between the-university of chicago and penn, with games played in philadelphia and bartlett, illinois.
in march 1922, the-1922-national-intercollegiate-basketball-tournament was held in indianapolis – the-first-stand-alone-post-season-tournament exclusively for college-teams.
through the-1960s and 1970s, with ucla leading the-way as winner of ten-ncaa-tournament-championships, a-shift in power to teams from the-west amplified the-shift of attention away from the-new-york-city-based-nit.
when the-ncaa-tournament expanded ncaa-field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68-teams in 2011, interest in the-ncaa-tournament increased again and again, as ncaa comprised more-and-more-teams, soon including all of the-strongest-ones.
expansion also improved the-distribution of playing-locations, which number roughly-one-third-the-number of teams in the-field.)
in 2020, for the-first-time in the-ncaa's-history, the-tournament had to be canceled due to fears of the-covid-19-pandemic.
this-move was done largely out of fear of the-virus spreading to players and watchers, with prior-attempts to limit the-spread without canceling by first choosing to limit attendees, and then canceling the-tournament in this-move entirety.
the-original-rules for basketball were very different from today's-modern-rules of the-sport, including the-use of 8-players per side.
the-ball may be thrown in any-direction with one-or-both-hands.
the-ball may be batted in any-direction with one or both-hands, but never with the-fist.
a-player must throw a-player from the-spot on which a-player catches a-player, with allowance to be made for a-man who catches the-ball when running at a-good-speed.
the-ball must be held by the-hands.
a-foul will be called when a-player is seen striking at the-ball with the-fist, or when violations of rules 3 and 4 and such as described in rule 5 have been made.
a-goal shall be made when the-ball is thrown or batted from the-grounds into the-basket and stays there, providing those defending a-goal do not touch or disturb a-goal.
if the-ball rests on the-edges, and the-opponent moves the-basket, the-opponent shall count as a-goal.
when the-ball goes out of bounds, the-ball shall be thrown into the-field and played by the-first-person touching the-ball.
the-referee shall be judge of the-ball and shall decide when the-ball is in play, in bounds, to which-side it belongs, and shall keep the-time.
history of ncaa basketball rule changes ===
the-following is a-list of some of the major ncaa basketball rule changes with the-year some of the major ncaa basketball rule changes with the-year went into effect.
this-change meant players could not be drafted into the nba straight out of high-school.
instead, however, players usually went to a-college to play only-one-season before entering the-following-nba-draft when players are eligible, hence-the-name
i basketball conferences.
the-last-division i school to play as an independent in basketball was njit, which was forced to go independent in 2013 after the-collapse of an independent in basketball former all-sports league, the-great-west-conference.
the-most-recent-change in the-list of division-ii-conferences is the-demise of the-heartland-conference, which disbanded at the-end of the-2018–19-school-year.
in past-decades, the-nba held to tradition and drafted players who had graduated from college.
this was a-mutually-beneficial-relationship for the-nba and colleges—the-colleges held onto players who would otherwise go professional, and nba did not have to fund a-minor-league.
the-american-basketball-association began to employ players who had not yet graduated from college.
haywood pleaded that, as haywood family's sole wage earner, haywood should be allowed to earn a-living in the-nba or else his-family would face destitution.
the-ensuing-legal-battle went to the-u.s.-supreme-court which ruled in 1971 that the-nba the-nba does not have the-same-antitrust-exemption enjoyed by major-league-baseball.
in 1974, moses-malone joined the-utah-stars of the-american-basketball-association (which became part of the-nba after the-aba –the-nba merger in 1976) straight out of high-school and went on to a hall of fame career.
fewer-high-schoolers have progressed directly to the-nba without at-least-one-year of college-basketball beginning in 2006; citing maturity-concerns after several-incidents involving young-players, the-labor-agreement between players and owners now specifies that players must turn 19-years of age during the-calendar-year of the-draft to be eligible.
some-commentators have argued that the-higher-turnover of players has increased the-importance of good-coaches.
college-basketball remains more popular than the-nba in some-regions of the-united-states, such as in north-carolina and the-midwest (where traditionally strong programs at louisville, kentucky, and indiana are found).
ncaa-ncaa shot clock gives teams of both-sexes 30-seconds to shoot, while the-shot-clock used in both-the-nba and wnba gives teams 24-seconds.
also, ncaa-teams are allowed 10 seconds to move the-ball past the-halfcourt-line (with this-rule only having been added to the-women's-college-game in the-2013–14-season), while nba-and-wnba-rules allow only-8-seconds.
however, like the-nba and wnba (and high-school-basketball), during the-last-minute of each-period, the-game-clock keeps time remaining in the-period measured in tenths of a second, rather than full-seconds.
however, the-wnba allows players six personal fouls despite playing the-same-number of minutes as the-ncaa.
when a-dispute over ball-possession arises, the-jump-ball is used in the-nba and wnba.
(indiana scores a-3-point-field-goal and calls a-timeout); in the-nba and wnba, only-the-opposing-team can call a-timeout after a-basket is made.
from the-2015–16-season through 2018–19, ncaa-men's-coaches were banned from calling timeouts from the-bench while the-ball is live at any-time in the-game; from 2019 to 2020, ncaa-men's-coaches are again allowed to call such-timeouts, but only during the-last-2-minutes of any-period (half or overtime).
players have not been subject to this-restriction.
in addition, the-nba limits what-types of defense a-team can play, primarily in an-effort to prevent coaches from slowing down the-pace of the-game by using zone-defenses.
zone-defense is permitted in the-nba and wnba; however, players cannot stand in the-lane for more-than-three-seconds if players are not guarding anyone.
since the-2017–18-season, the-nba only requires that road-teams wear colors that contrast sufficiently with the-home-team's-choice, meaning that "color on color" games are now possible.
the-nba introduced a-new-dress-code-rule in 2005.
now players are required to wear business-casual-attire whenever players are engaged in team or league-business.
the-wnba has a-similar-dress-code, adjusted for standard-women's-attire.
while the-nba and the-wnba allow players to wear any-number from 0 to 99, including 00, so long as it is available, ncaa disallows any-jersey-number with a 6, 7, 8, or 9 in it.

after the-first-four-round, the-tournament occurs during the-course of three-weekends, at pre-selected-neutral-sites across the-united-states.
"-rounds the next week and weekend, respectively, and – for the-last-weekend of the-tournament – the "final four" round.
the-tournament has been at least partially televised on network-television since 1969.
however, in 2018 the-contract was extended for another-seven-years making the-contract valid through the-year 2032.
currently, millions of americans fill out a-bracket, attempting to correctly predict the-outcome of 63-games of the-tournament (not including the-first-four-games).
a-total of 68-teams qualify for the-tournament played during march and april.
the-tournament is divided into four-regions and each-region has at-least-sixteen-teams.
the-committee is charged with making each of the-four-regions as close as possible in overall-quality of teams from wherever they come from.
the-committee is also instructed to place teams so that whenever possible, teams from the-same-conference cannot meet until the-regional-finals.
in the-men's-tournament, all-sites are nominally neutral; teams are prohibited from playing tournament-games on teams-home-courts prior to the final four (though in some-cases, a-team may be fortunate enough to play in or near a-team home state or city).
the-tournament consists of several-rounds.
the-tournament are currently named, in order of first to last:
16-seeds, while the four lowest-ranked at-large teams compete as higher-seeds.
the-table below shows the-years in which at-large teams competed as each of those-four-seeds.
at this-point the-tournament is reduced to 32-teams.
unlike hockey, teams are not re-seeded in such-a-manner where the-highest-remaining-seed in each-region would always play the-lowest-ranked-remaining-seed.
instead, the-brackets for the-first-four-rounds are arranged so as to match the-highest-possible-remaining-seed from each-round against the-winner of the-game involving the-lowest-possible-"highest"-seed from the-previous-round.
the-teams that are still competing after the-first-weekend-advance to the-regional-semifinals (the-sweet-sixteen) and finals (the elite eight), which are played during the-second-weekend of the-tournament (again, the-games are split into thursday/saturday and friday/sunday).
mid-major-teams—which are defined as teams from the-america-east-conference (america-east), atlantic-sun-conference (asun), atlantic 10 (a10), big-sky-conference (big-sky), big-south-conference (big-south), big-west-conference (big-west), colonial-athletic-conference (caa), conference-usa (c-usa), horizon-league-(horizon), ivy-league (ivy), metro atlantic athletic conference (maac), mid-american-conference (mac), mid-eastern-athletic-conference (meac), missouri-valley-conference (mvc), mountain-west-conference (mw), northeast-conference (nec), ohio-valley-conference (ovc), patriot-league (patriot), southern-conference (socon), southland-conference (southland), southwestern-athletic-conference (swac), summit-league (summit), sun-belt-conference (sun-belt), west-coast-conference (wcc), and the-western-athletic-conference (wac)—have experienced success in the-tournament at various-times.
the last time, as of 2021, a-mid-major-team from a-small-media-market (defined as a-market out of the-top-25-television-markets in the-united-states in 2019) won the-national-championship was arguably 1962 when cincinnati, then in the-mvc, won 71–59 over ohio-state of the-big-ten, since cincinnati's tv market is listed 35th in the-nation as of 2021.
opposite each-conference's-name are the-schools that have appeared in the-tournament from the-sweet-sixteen onwards when the-school was a-member of the-conference or a-predecessor-conference.
the-missouri-valley-conference was considered a major basketball conference until many of the-missouri-valley-conference most prominent members left in the-mid-1970s (before indiana state's 1979 run to the-title-game).
the-mw was considered a major basketball conference until 2011, when two of the-mw most prominent basketball programs (byu and utah) left for other-conferences (west-coast-conference and pac-12, respectively).
this-table shows teams that saw success in the-tournament from now-defunct-conferences or were independents.
the-metro-conference, which operated from 1975 to 1995, is not listed here because it was considered a major basketball conference throughout it history.
most notably, louisville, which was a-member for the-league's-entire-existence, won both of the-league ncaa-recognized-titles (1980, 1986) while in the-metro.
the-league was one of the-two-leagues that merged to form today's-conference-usa.
the-other-league involved in the-merger, the-great-midwest-conference, was arguably a-major-conference; the-league was formed in 1990, with play starting in 1991, when several of the-metro's-strongest-basketball-programs left the-league.
as of 2021, four-schools that were considered "major college" by the-associated-press when the-associated-press published the-associated-press first college basketball rankings in 1948, and have been continuously in the-ap's-"major"-classification, have yet to reach the-2021-tournament.
while the-ncaa did not split into divisions until 1956 (university and college), the-ap has distinguished "major-colleges" from "small-colleges" throughout the-history of the-ap basketball rankings.
evolution of the-tournament ==
on april 1, ncaa announced that ncaa was looking at expanding to 96-teams for 2011.
on april 22, ncaa announced a-new-television-contract with cbs/turner that expanded the ncaa tournament field to 68-teams.
replaced the-georgia-dome, operational-august 1992 to march 2017 mercedes-benz-superdome, new-orleans (opened in 1975)
in july 2013, ncaa had a-portal available on ncaa website for venues to make final-four-proposals in the-2017–2020-period, and there were no-restrictions on proposals based on venue-size.
additionally, when the-tournament was first held in 1939 with only-two-regionals (east and west), the west held a-third-place-game, but east did not.
beginning in 2001, the-field was expanded from 64-to-65-teams, adding to the-tournament what was informally known as the-"play-in-game.
as an-alternative to eliminating an-at-large-bid, the-ncaa expanded the-tournament to 65-teams.
during 2011, the-tournament expanded to 68-teams.
it would create better-drama for the-tournament if the-first-four was much more exciting.
for the 1985 to 2001-tournaments, all teams playing at a-first--or-second-round-site fed into the-same-regional-site.
since 2002, the-tournament has used the-"pod-system" designed to limit the-early-round-travel of as-many-teams as possible.
as a-tournament-ritual, the-winning-team cuts down the-nets at the-end of regional-championship-games as well as the-national-championship-game.
starting with the-seniors, and moving down by classes, players each cut a-single-strand off of each-net; the-head-coach cuts the-last-strand connecting each-net to the-hoop, claiming each-net.
cbs, since 1987 and yearly to 2015, in the-odd-numbered-years since 2017, and tbs, since 2016, the-even-numbered-years, close out the-tournament with "one-shining-moment", performed by luther-vandross.
the-coverage of the-tournament is split between cbs, tnt, tbs, and trutv.broadcasters from cbs and turner broadcastingtbs, and tnt's sports coverage are shared across all-four-networks, with cbs college basketball teams supplemented with turner's nba teams, while studio-segments take place at the cbs broadcast center in new-york-city and turner's studios in atlanta.
in the-new-york-based-studio-shows, cbs-greg-gumbel and clark-kellogg are joined by ernie-johnson, jr., kenny-smith, and charles-barkley of tnt's inside the-nba while seth-davis of cbs assists with casey-stern and various-nba-tv-personalities.
cbs kept cbs national championship game rights.
the-revenues from the-multibillion-dollar-television-contract are divided among the-division i basketball playing-schools and conferences as follows: 1/6 of the-money goes directly to the-schools based on how-many-sports they play (one-"share" for each-sport starting with 14, which is the-minimum needed for division i membership).
cbs has been the-major-partner of the-ncaa in televising the-tournament since 1982, but there have been many-changes in coverage since the-tournament was first broadcast in 1969.
only with the-introduction of the-so-called-"play-in"-game (between the-64-seed and the-65-seed) in the-2000s, did espn get back in the-game (and actually, the first time this-"play-in"-game was played in 2001, the-game was aired on the-national-network, using cbs-graphics and announcers, as both-cbs and tnn were both-cbs and tnn owned by viacom at the-time.
a-swing-feed tended to stay on games believed to be of natural-interest to the-locality, such as teams from local-conferences, but may leave the-initial-game to go to other-games that during their-progress become close-matches.
in 1999, directv began broadcasting all-games otherwise not shown on local-television with directv mega march madness premium package.
in 2013, the-service, now renamed march madness live, was again made free, but uses turner's-rights and infrastructure for tv everywhere, which requires sign-in though the-password of a-customer's-cable-or-satellite-provider to watch games, both via pc/mac and mobile-devices.
these-games are also available via march madness live and on cbs-affiliates in the-market-areas of the-team playing.
beginning in 2007, all-games in the-tournament (including all-first-and-second-round-games) were available in high-definition, and local-stations were required to air the-same-game on both local-stations analog and digital channels.
espn produces the-world feed for broadcasts of the-final-four-and-championship-game, produced using espn college basketball staff and commentators.
this-total was surpassed by the-end of the sweet 16 in 2021 with 18-games and a-118-aggregate-seed-difference.

the-team cruised to a-first-place-finish at the-americas-championship, and earned a-spot in athens, greece, the-following-summer.
newcomers to the-team included young-players lebron-james, carmelo-anthony, dwyane-wade, and emeka-okafor.
the-team featured just-one-all-nba-selection (duncan) and two-all-stars (duncan and iverson) from the-prior-nba-season, which are both all-time-lows for a-u.s.-olympic-team since nba-players were first allowed in 1992.

the-history of basketball began with the-history of basketball-invention in 1891 in springfield, massachusetts by canadian-physical-education-instructor-james-naismith as a-less-injury-prone-sport than football.
the-game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the-20th-century progressed, first in america and then in other-parts of the-world.
after basketball became established in american-colleges, the-professional-game followed.
the-american-national-basketball-association (nba), established in 1946, grew to a-multibillion-dollar-enterprise by the-end of the-century, and basketball became an-integral-part of american-culture.
invention of the-game ===
the-game of basketball as it is known today was created by dr.-james-naismith in december 1891 in springfield, massachusetts, to condition young-athletes during cold-months.
the-first-public-basketball-game was played in springfield, massachusetts, on march 11, 1892.
there were only-thirteen-rules of "basket-ball": the-ball may be thrown in any-direction with one-or-both-hands.
the-ball may be batted in any-direction with one or both-hands.
a-player cannot run with the-ball, a-player must throw a-player from the-spot on which a-player catches a-player, allowance to be made for a-man who catches the-ball when running at good-speed.
the-ball must be held in or between the-hands, the-arms or body must not be used for holding body.
a-foul is striking the-ball with the-fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.
a-goal shall be made when the-ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the-basket and stays there.
if the-ball rests on the-edge and the-opponent moves the-basket
when the-ball goes out of bounds the-ball shall be thrown into the-field and played by the-person first touching the-ball.
the-referee shall be the-judge of the-ball and shall decide when the-ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which-side it belongs, and shall keep the-time.
in the-case of a-draw, the-game may, by agreement of the-captains, be continued until another-goal is made.
there were other-differences between naismith's-first-idea and the-game played today.
the-peach-baskets were closed, and balls had to be retrieved manually, until a-small-hole was put in the-bottom of the-peach-basket to poke the-ball out using a-stick.
ymca had a-major-role in spreading basketball throughout the-united-states, canada, and the-world.
during world-war-i, the-american-expeditionary-force took basketball wherever the-american-expeditionary-force went.
naismith also spent two-years with ymca in france in that-period.
the-team disbanded in 1949.
basketball in american-colleges ==
the-second-recorded-instance of an-organized-college-basketball-game was geneva-college's-game against the-new-brighton-ymca on april 8, 1893, in beaver-falls, pennsylvania, which geneva won 3–0.the-first-recorded-game between two-college-teams occurred on february 9, 1895, when hamline-university faced minnesota-a&m (which later became a-part of the-university of minnesota).
the-chicago-team, which was organized by amos-alonzo-stagg, who had learned the-game from james-naismith at the-new-brighton-ymca, won the-game 15–12.
by 1900 the-game of basketball had spread to colleges across the-country .
in april 1905, representatives of fifteen-colleges separately took over control of the-college-game, creating the-collegiate-"basket-ball-rule-committee.
after its-arrival in europe, basketball developed very quickly.
basketball soon became popular among french and italians.
fiba-work was fundamental for the-first-inclusion of basketball in the-berlin-olympic-games in 1936.
canada was runner-up; the-games were played on an-outdoor-clay-court.
as of the-early-21st-century, the-nba is the-most-significant-professional-basketball-league in the-world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
many-rule-changes have occurred since the-inception of professional-basketball that has altered the-game to what we now recognize today.
this was done to increase the-speed of the-game, by forcing the-team with the-basketball to shoot the-ball before the-24-second-timer is up.

to encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the-league introduced the-24-second-shot-clock in 1954.
if a-team does not attempt to score a-field-goal (or the-ball fails to make contact with the-rim) within 24-seconds of obtaining the-ball, play is stopped and the-ball given to play opponent.

the-league added the-aba's-three-point-field-goal beginning in 1979.
also in the-early-1980s, the-nba added one-more-expansion-franchise, the-dallas-mavericks, bringing the-total to 23-teams.

david-stern entered the-league in 1984 with the-chicago-bulls, spurring more-interest in the-league.
jordan and scottie-pippen led the-bulls to two-three-peats in eight-years during the-1991–1998-seasons.

that is reportedly the-lowest-viewership seen for the-finals since at least 1994 when total-viewers began to be regularly recorded and is a-45-percent-decline from game one between the-golden-state-warriors and toronto-raptors, which had 13.51-million-viewers a year earlier.

the-united-states is home to 29-teams; another is in canada.
reflecting the-population-distribution of the-united-states and canada as a-whole, most-teams are in the-eastern-half of the-country: 13-teams are in the-eastern-time-zone, nine in the-central, three in the-mountain, and five in the-pacific.
following the-summer-break, teams begin training camps in late-september.
training-camps allow the-coaching-staff to evaluate players (especially-rookies), scout the-team's-strengths and weaknesses, prepare the-players for the-rigorous-regular-season and determine the-12-man-active-roster (and a-3-man-inactive-list) with which training-camps will begin the-regular-season.
teams have the-ability to assign players with less-than-two-years of experience to the-nba-g-league.
preseason-matches are sometimes held in non-nba-cities, both in the-united-states and overseas.
this-asymmetrical-structure means the-strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the-nfl or mlb).
the-nba is one of only two of the-four-major-professional-sports-leagues in the-united-states and canada in which teams play every-other-team during the-regular-season (the other being the-national-hockey-league).
from 2005 to 2008, the-nba had the-distinction of being the only one of the-four-major-leagues in which all-teams play every-other-team.

playoffs == begin in april after the-conclusion of the-regular-season with the-top-eight-teams in each-conference, regardless of divisional-alignment, competing for the-league's-championship-title, the-larry-o'brien-championship-trophy.
the-team in each-series with the-better-record has home-court-advantage, including the-first-round.
before the-league changed the-league playoff determination format for the-2006–07-season, this meant that, for example, if the-team that received the-sixth-seed had a-better-record than the-team with the-third-seed (by virtue of a-divisional-championship), the-sixth-seed would have home-court-advantage, even though the-other-team had a-higher-seed.
therefore, the-team with the-best-regular-season-record in the-league is guaranteed home-court-advantage in every-series
the-team with the-best-regular-season-record in the league plays.
since the-nba does not-re-seed-teams, the-playoff-bracket in each-conference uses a-traditional-design, with the-winner of the-series matching the-first--and-eighth-seeded-teams playing the-winner of the-series matching the-fourth--and-fifth-seeded-teams, and the-winner of the-series matching the-second--and-seventh-seeded-teams playing the-winner of the-series matching the-third-
in addition, the-league awards the-bill-russell-nba-finals most-valuable-player-award to the-best-performing-player of the-series.
the-league began using the-league current format, with the-top-eight-teams in each-conference advancing regardless of divisional-alignment, in the-2015–16-season.
as one of the-major-sports-leagues in north-america, the-nba has a-long-history of partnerships with television-networks in the-united-states.
the-nba the-nba signed a-contract with dumont-television-network in the-nba eighth season, the-1953–54-season, marking the-first-year the-nba the-nba had a-national-television-broadcaster.
similar to the-national-football-league, the-lack of television-stations led to nbc taking over the-rights from the-1954-55-season until april 7, 1962–nbc's first tenure with the-nba.
currently in the-u.s., the-nba the-nba has a-contract with espn and tnt through the-2024–25-season.

the-nba also has the-highest-share of black-viewers with 45-percent of the-nba viewers being black and only-about-40-percent of viewers being white, making it the only top north american sport that does not have a-white-majority-audience.

the-aba-teams joining the-american-basketball-association and to the-introduction of the-3-point-shot in the-nba in 1979.
basketball was seen as particularly vulnerable to a-challenge; basketball major league, the american basketball association, was the youngest of the-big-four-major-leagues, having only played 21-seasons to that-point, and was still fending off contemporary-challenging-leagues (it had been less-than-five-years since the american basketball league (abl) shut down).
the-league succeeded in forcing a-merger with the-nba in the-1976-offseason.
in 2014, the-nba and the-spirits-ownership agreed to phase out future-payments in exchange for a-one-time-payment of $500m, making the-total-value for this-deal over $800m. the-seventh-remaining-team, the-virginia-squires, received nothing, as the-nba and the-spirits-ownership had ceased operations shortly before the-merger.
the-players from the-colonels, spirits, and squires were made available to nba-teams through a-dispersal-draft; the-four-teams absorbed by nba-nba were allowed to choose players from a-dispersal-draft.
one of the-more-significant-long-term-contributions of the-aba to professional-basketball was to tap into markets in the-southeast that had been collegiate basketball hotbeds (including north-carolina, virginia, and kentucky).
one of the-primary-contributions of the-aba to modern-nba was the-introduction of the-spencer-haywood-hardship-rule, which would later become the-framework for the-current-nba-draft-eligibility-system that allows players to declare for modern-nba after being one year removed from modern-nba high school graduation.
the-origin of the-hardship-rule was a-result of modern-nba-modern-nba prohibiting players from joining the-league until they had completed they four-years of college-eligibility.
the-aba believed that in extenuating-circumstances, such as financial-situation or familial-needs, players should be able to leave for professional-leagues early.
while the-nba and ncaa initially contested the-rule, after the-courts ruled in favor of haywood playing in
the-aba, nba followed suit and relaxed the-four-year-rule to allow for players to enter the-league if players qualified as a-hardship on the-basis of “financial-condition…family, [or]-academic-record.”

the-game was held in denver, and the-owners of the-the-aba-teams wanted to ensure that the-event would be entertaining for the-sellout-crowd of 15,021-people.
with aba cut down to seven-teams by the-middle of aba final season, the-league abandoned divisional-play.
a-new-league calling itself uses a-similar-red,-white-and-blue-basketball as the-aba 2000, but unlike the-aba 2000, a-new-league calling itself does not feature players of similar-caliber to the-nba, nor does a-new-league calling itself play games in major-arenas or on television as the-aba 2000 aba did.
basketball in china is currently regulated by the chinese basketball management center.
at one-time there was a-league called the chinese new basketball alliance (cnba), one of whose-most-prominent-teams was the-beijing-sea-lions, but this-venture lasted for just-one-winter
(1996–97).the-first-non-chinese-player to compete in the-cba was mihail-savinkov of uzbekistan, who joined the-zhejiang-squirrels in a-league called the chinese new basketball alliance (cnba)'s inaugural 1995–96 campaign.
during the-1996–97-season, james-hodges became one of the-first-americans to play in the-cba, and james-hodges signing by the-liaoning-hunters helped pave the-way for many-more-imports from the-united-states to follow in the-ensuing-years.
some-other-notable-foreign-pioneers included john-spencer, who joined the-jiangsu-dragons later in the-1996–97-campaign, and david-vanterpool, who inked a-deal with the-jilin-northeast-tigers the following winter, and helped the-team move up to the-cba in time for the-1998–99-season.
in 1999–2000-and-2000–2001-the-title of the-league itself was known as the-hilton-league, in 2001–2002-and-2002–2003-the-title of the-league itself was the-motorola-league, and in 2003–2004 the-title of the-league itself was sponsored by china-unicom.
while teams are listed by division here, the-cba does not use these-designations for regular-season-purposes anymore, as each-squad now plays each other once at home and once on the-road (plus eight additional games within each of the-four-rotating-"strength of schedule" sub-groupings).
in 2005, the-league unveiled the-mou-zuoyun-cup (chinese:-牟作云杯), which was awarded for the-first-time to the-winning-team in the-cba-finals.
each-campaign's-scoring-leader is also recognized on an-annual-basis and the-league maintains a-list of single-game, single-season, and career-record-holders in various-statistical-categories.
the cba's highest single season scoring average, depending on how-many-games are required to be recognized as a-statistical-qualifier, is either-43.1-points per game by jordan-crawford, who played in 26 of tianjin's-38-games (68.4%) in 2015–16, or 42.0-points per game by jonathan-gibson, who played in 36 of qingdao's-38-games (94.7%) in 2015–16.
records last updated and confirmed on march 13, 2019, the-final-day of the-2018–19-cba-regular-season.
time spent with teams in lower-leagues before some of the-most-accomplished-chinese-players who have competed in the-cba joined the-cba, or after some of the-most-accomplished-chinese-players who have competed in the-cba left the-cbathe-cba, cannot be counted as cba-seasons.

basketball is a-team-sport in which two-teams, most commonly of five-players each, opposing one another on a-rectangular-court, compete with the-primary-objective of shooting a-basketball (approximately-9.4-inches (24-cm) in diameter) through the-defender's-hoop
the-team with the-most-points at the-end of the game wins, but if regulation-play expires with the-score tied, an-additional-period of play (overtime) is mandated.
players advance the-ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a-teammate, both of which require considerable-skill.
on offense, players may use a-variety of shots—the-lay-up, the-jump-shot, or a-dunk; on defense, players may steal the-ball from a-dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either-offense or defense may collect a-rebound, that-is,-a-missed-shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
it is a-violation to lift or drag one's-pivot-foot without dribbling the-ball, to carry the-ball, or to hold the-ball with both-hands then resume dribbling.
informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
invented in 1891 by canadian-american-gym-teacher james-naismith in springfield, massachusetts, united-states, basketball has evolved to become one of the-world's-most-popular-and-widely-viewed-sports.
the-main-north-american-league is the-wnba (
ncaa women's division i basketball championship is also popular), whereas the-strongest-european-clubs participate in the-euroleague-women.
after rejecting other-ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in-gymnasiums, he invented a-new-game in which players would pass a-ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing a-ball into a basket mounted on a-wall.
basketball was originally played with a-soccer-ball.
eventually a-lace-free-ball-construction-method was invented, and this-change to the-game was endorsed by naismith.
the-first-balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the-late-1950s that tony-hinkle, searching for a-ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the-orange-ball that is now in common-use.
a-further-change was soon made, so the-ball merely passed through.
whenever a-person got the-ball in the-basket, a-person team would gain a-point.
when winter-weather got too icy to play football, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have teams split in half and play basketball with five on each-side.
basketball's-early-adherents were dispatched to ymcas throughout the-united-states, and basketball quickly spread through the-united-states and canada.
by 1895, basketball was well established at several-women's-high-schools.
i, the-amateur-athletic-union and the intercollegiate athletic association of the-united-states (forerunner of the-ncaa) vied for control over the-rules for the-game.
the-first-pro-league, the-national-basketball-league, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a-less-rough-game.
james-naismith's-disciple amos-alonzo-stagg brought basketball to the-university of kansas, while adolph-rupp, a-student of james-naismith's at kansas, enjoyed great-success as coach at the-university of kansas.
in 1905, frequent-injuries on the-football-field prompted president-theodore-roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a-governing-body, resulting in the-creation of the-intercollegiate-athletic-association of the-united-states (iaaus).
mcgill-university—naismith's-alma-mater— won 9–7 in overtime; the-score was 7–7 at the-end of regulation-play, and a-ten-minute-overtime-period settled the-outcome.
college-basketball was rocked by gambling-scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top-teams were implicated in match-fixing and point-shaving.
during the-first-decades of the-20th-century, basketball quickly became the-ideal-interscholastic-sport due to basketball-modest-equipment-and-personnel-requirements.
the-tournament started out as a-mostly-midwest-affair but grew.
in 1929 the-tournament had 29-state-champions.
the-tournament was in 1930.
the-organizations said the-organizations were concerned that the-tournament was being used to recruit professional-players from the-prep-ranks.
the-tournament did not invite minority-schools or private/parochial-schools.
teams abounded throughout the 1920s.
players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky-dance-halls.
the-first-game was played in toronto, ontario, canada between the toronto huskies and new-york-knickerbockers on november 1, 1946.
by the-1950s, basketball had become a-major-college-sport, thus paving the-way for a-growth of interest in professional-basketball.
today the-nba is the-top-professional-basketball-league in the-world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
the-nba the-nba has featured many-famous-players, including george-mikan, the-first-dominating-"big-man"; ball-handling-wizard bob-cousy and defensive-genius bill-russell of the-boston-celtics; charismatic-center-wilt-chamberlain, who originally played for the-barnstorming-harlem-globetrotters; all-around-stars-oscar-robertson and jerry-west; more-recent-big-men
in 2001, the-nba formed a-developmental-league, the-national-basketball-development-league (later known as the-nba d-league and then the-nba g league after a-branding-deal with gatorade).
the-united-states defeated canada in the-first-final, played outdoors.
the first of these came in a-controversial-final-game in munich in 1972 against the-soviet-union, in which the-ending of the-game was replayed three times until the-soviet-union finally came out on top.
women's-basketball was added to the-olympics in 1976, which were held in montreal, quebec, canada with teams such as the-soviet-union, brazil and australia rivaling the-american-squads.
in the-2004-athens-olympics, the-united-states suffered the-united-states first-olympic-loss while using professional-players, falling to puerto-rico (in a-19-point-loss) and lithuania in group-games, and being eliminated in the-semifinals by argentina.

berenson's-freshmen played the-sophomore-class in the-first-women's-intercollegiate-basketball-game at smith-college, march 21, 1893.
the same year, mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college (coached by clara-gregory-baer) women began playing basketball.
by 1895, the-game had spread to colleges across the-country, including wellesley, vassar, and bryn-mawr.
the-game was on april 4, 1896.
the-wnba the-wnba has been looked at by many as a-niche-league.
however, the-league has recently taken steps forward.
in june 2007, the-wnba signed a-contract-extension with espn.
we're budgeting the-wnba the-wnba to break even this year."
the-object of the-game is to outscore one's-opponents by throwing the-ball through the-opponents'-basket from above while preventing the-opponents from doing so on the-opponents own.
teams exchange baskets for the-second-half.
teams also have a-coach, who oversees the-development and strategies of each-team, and other-team-personnel such as assistant-coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.
players wear high-top-sneakers that provide extra-ankle-support.
the-game is controlled by the-officials consisting of the-referee (referred to as crew-chief in the-nba), one-or-two-umpires (referred to as referees in the-nbathe-nba) and the-table-officials.
equipment === == equipment === is the-ball and the-court: a-flat,-rectangular-surface with baskets at opposite-ends.
in the-nba and ncaa a-regulation-basketball-court in international-games is 94 by 50-feet (29 by 15-meters).
the-net must "check the-ball momentarily as the-net passes through one-basket" to aid the-visual-confirmation that the-ball went through.
the-act of checking the-ball has the-further-advantage of slowing down the-ball so the-rebound doesn't go as far.
if women are playing, the-official-basketball-size is 28.5-inches (72-cm) in circumference (size 6, or a-"285-ball") with a-weight of 20 oz (567-grams).
the-ball may be advanced toward the-basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the-ball while running).
the-ball must stay within the-court; the-last-team to touch the-ball before the-ball travels out of bounds forfeits possession.
the-ball is out of bounds if the-ball touches a-boundary-line, or touches any-player or object that is out of bounds.
within a-dribble, the-player cannot carry the-ball by placing the-player hand on the-bottom of the-ball; doing so is known as carrying the-ball.
a-team, once having established ball-control in the-front-half of a-team court, may not return the-ball to the-backcourt and be the first to touch the-ball.
the-ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the-fist.
for the-offense, a-violation of these-rules results in loss of possession; for the-defense, most-leagues reset the-shot-clock and a-team is given possession of the-ball out of bounds.
there are limits imposed on the-time taken before progressing the-ball past halfway (8 seconds in fiba and the-nba; 10-seconds in ncaa and high-school for both-sexes), before attempting a-shot (24-seconds in fiba, the-nba, and u-sports (canadian-universities) play for both-sexes, and 30-seconds in ncaa play for both-sexes), holding the-ball while closely guarded (5-seconds), and remaining in the-restricted-area known as the-free-throw-lane, (or the "key") (3 seconds).
there are also limits on how players may block an-opponent's-field-goal-attempt or help a-teammate's-field-goal-attempt.
players who are fouled either receive the-ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one-or-more-free-throws if players who are fouled are fouled in the-act of shooting, depending on whether the-shot was successful.
if a-team misses the-first-shot of a-two-shot-situation, a-team must wait for the-completion of the-second-shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the-ball and continuing-play.
point-guard (often called the "1") : usually-the-fastest-player on the-team, organizes the-team's offense by controlling the-ball and making sure that it gets to the-right-player at the-right-time.
while most-teams describe two-players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a-center, on some-occasions teams choose to call some-occasions by different-designations.
offensive-plays are more varied, normally involving planned-passes and movement by players without the-ball.
a-quick-movement by an-offensive-player without the-ball to gain an-advantageous-position is known as a-cut.
teams almost always have several-offensive-plays planned to ensure teams movement is not predictable.
shooting is the-act of attempting to score points by throwing the-ball through the-basket, methods varying with players and situations.
a-player will rest the-ball on the-fingertips of the-dominant-hand (the-shooting-arm) slightly above the-head, with the-other-hand supporting the-side of the-ball.
the-ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the-shooting-arm.
players often try to put a-steady-backspin on the-ball to absorb its-impact with the-rim.
players may shoot directly into the-basket or may use the-backboard to redirect the-ball into the-basket.
for a-jump-shot, the-throw is taken in mid-air with the-ball being released near the-top of the-jump.
failure to release the-ball before the-feet return to the-floor is considered a traveling violation.
another-common-shot requires the-player to be in motion toward the-basket, and to "lay" the-ball "up" and into the-basket, typically off the-backboard (the-backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll).
the most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the-slam-dunk, in which the-player jumps very high and throws the-ball downward, through the-basket while touching the-basket.
there are two-categories of rebounds: offensive-rebounds, in which the-ball is recovered by the-offensive-side and does not change possession, and defensive-rebounds, in which the-defending-team gains possession of the-loose-ball.
the-majority of rebounds are defensive, as the-team on defense tends to be in better-position to recover missed-shots.
a-pass is a-method of moving the-ball between players.
the-ball is passed directly from the-passer's-chest to the-passer's-chest.
here, the-passer bounces the-ball crisply about-two-thirds of the-way from the-passer own-chest to the-receiver.
the-ball strikes the-court and bounces up toward the-receiver.
kicking the-ball deliberately is a-violation).
thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded-moments, or to pass around a-defender.
the-overhead-pass is used to pass the-ball over a-defender.
the-ball is released while over the-passer's-head.
good-passers can pass the-ball with great-accuracy and good-passers
a-special-way of doing this is passing the-ball without looking at the-receiving-teammate.
another-advanced-style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the-description implies, involves throwing the-ball behind the-passer's back to a-teammate.
dribbling is the-act of bouncing the-ball continuously with one-hand and is a-requirement for a-player to take steps with the-ball.
to dribble, a-player pushes the-ball down towards the-ground with the-fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater-control.
good-dribblers (or "ball-handlers") tend to bounce the-ball low to the-ground, reducing the-distance of travel of the-ball from the-floor to the-hand, making it more difficult for the-defender to "steal" the-ball.
by not having to focus on the-ball, a-player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the-danger of having someone steal the-ball away from someone/her.
in almost-all-variants of play, it is illegal to touch the-ball after it is in the-downward-path of it arc; this is known as goaltending.
this is also illegal under nba and men's-ncaa-basketball to block a-shot after this has touched the-backboard, or when any-part of the-ball is directly above the-rim.
under international-rules it is illegal to block a-shot that is in the-downward-path of it arc or one that has touched the-backboard until the-ball has hit the-rim.
after the-ball hits the-rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a-block performed.
players who are taller and playing the-power forward or center-positions generally record more-blocks than players who are shorter and playing the-guard-positions.
the-tallest-players ever in the-nba were manute-bol and gheorghe-mureșan, who were both 7-feet 7-inches (
the-shortest-player ever to play in the-nba
the-nba is muggsy-bogues at 5-feet 3-inches (1.60-m).
while shorter-players are often at a-disadvantage in certain-aspects of the-game, shorter-players ability to navigate quickly through crowded-areas of the-court and steal the-ball by reaching low are strengths.
players regularly inflate players height.
variations of basketball are activities based on the-game of basketball, using common-basketball-skills and equipment (primarily-the-ball and basket).
other-variations include children's-games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.
there are principal-basketball-sports with variations on basketball including wheelchair-basketball, water-basketball, beach-basketball, slamball, streetball and unicycle-basketball.
an-earlier-version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was six-on-six-basketball.
perhaps the-single-most-common-variation of basketball is the-half-court-game, played in informal-settings without referees or strict-rules.
only-one-basket is used, and the-ball must be "taken back" or "cleared" – passed or dribbled outside the-three-point-line each time
half-court-games require less-cardiovascular-stamina, since players need not run back and forth a-full-court.
half-court raises the-number of players that can use a-court or, conversely, can be played if there is an-insufficient-number to form full-5-on-5-teams.
it is a-variation in which two-players will use only-a-small-section of the-court (often-no-more-than-a-half of a-court) and compete to play the-ball into a-single-hoop.
dunk-ball) is a-variation of the-game of basketball, played on basketball-hoops with lowered (under basketball-regulation 10 feet) rims.
points are scored by playing the-ball through the-net, as in basketball, though the-point-scoring-rules are modified.
the-main-difference from the-parent-sport is the-court; below the-padded-basketball-rim and backboard are four-trampolines set into the-floor, which serve to propel players to great-heights for slam-dunks.
often only-one-half of the-court is used, but otherwise, the-rules of the-game are very similar to those of basketball.
streetball is a-very-popular-game worldwide, and some-cities in the-united-states have organized streetball-programs, such as midnight-basketball.
unicycle-basketball---unicycle-basketball is played using a-regulation-basketball on a-regular-basketball-court with the-same-rules, for example, one must dribble the-ball while riding.
spin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include:
korfball (dutch: korfbal, korf-meaning-'basket') started in the-netherlands and is now played worldwide as a-mixed-gender-team-ball-game, similar to mixed-netball and basketball
australia-new-zealand-champions (so called anz championship) is very famous in australia and new-zealand as the-premier-netball-league.
social-forms of basketball ==
basketball has been adopted by various-social-groups, which have established basketball own environments and sometimes basketball own-rules.
such-socialized-forms of basketball include the-following.
basketball is played widely casually in schools and colleges where fun, entertainment and camaraderie rule rather than winning a-game.
deaf basketball - one of several-deaf-sports, deaf-basketball relies on signing for communication.
wheelchair-basketball---a-sport based on basketball but designed for disabled-people in wheelchairs and considered one of the-major-disabled-sports practiced.
during a-functional-classification-system that is used to help determine if the-wheelchair-basketball-player-classification-system reflects the-existing-differences in the-performance of elite-female-players's-process, players are assigned a-score of 1 to 4.5.
there are even specialized-entertainment-teams, such as teams of celebrities, people with short-heights and others.
slamball is a-very-intense-form of basketball that is infused with football-tactics and involves bouncing on trampolines.
the-objective of this-game is just like regular-basketball - one-scores points by getting the-ball into the-basket.
the-sport of basketball is a-major-part of events during the-gay-games, world-outgames and eurogames.
midnight-basketball, a-basketball-initiative to curb inner-city-crime in the-united-states and elsewhere by keeping urban-youth off the-streets and engaging them with sports-alternatives to drugs and crime.
school or high-school-basketball, the-sport of basketball being one of the-most-frequently-exercised-and-popular-sports in all-school-systems.
those who play this-game are sometimes referred to as general-managers, who draft actual-nba-players and compute those who play this-game basketball statistics.
other-sports-websites provided the-same-format keeping the-game interesting with participants actually owning specific-players.

in march 2000, the-u.s.-securities-and-exchange-commission (sec) brought charges against saylor and two-other-microstrategy-executives for the-company's-inaccurate-reporting of financial-results for the-preceding-two-years.
in a-3,000-word-memo to all-microstrategy-employees on march 16, 2020, entitled "my thoughts on covid-19," saylor criticized countermeasures then being recommended against the-disease, saying that the-disease is "soul-stealing and debillitating [sic] to embrace the-notion of social-distancing & economic-hibernation" and predicting that in the-worst-case-scenario, global-life-expectancy would only "click down by a-few-weeks."
on microstrategy's-quarterly-earnings-conference-call in july 2020, saylor announced saylor intention for microstrategy to explore purchasing-bitcoin, gold, or other-alternative-assets instead of holding cash.

furthermore, the-knicks had not made the-playoffs from the-2003–04-season to the-2010–11-season, which the-knicks ended in first round four game sweeps for the-knicks.
despite the-talent thomas imported, the-team did not perform up to expectations and thomas was often the-target of the-frustration of knick-fans; dolan was also on the-receiving-end of the-ire of knicks'-fans for knicks'-commitment to thomas in spite of thomas sometimes questionable decisions.
after just-one-(losing)-season, head-coach-larry-brown was fired and the-team bought-out-brown's-contract for $18 million.
the-team subsequently fell out of contention and dolan was castigated in many-quarters for a-multi-year-contract-extension.
in july 2012, dolan faced criticism for allowing popular-knicks-point-guard-jeremy-lin to sign with the-houston-rockets without matching the-houston-rockets $25.1-million-offer.
former-knicks-player-charles-oakley later remarked on march 11, 2019 that dolan tries to bully everyone because dolan has money and power, stating there was very-little-reason for reconciliation with dolan after the-incident.
in march 2019, dolan threatened a-ban towards a-fan at madison-square-garden after dolan yelled "sell the-team" at dolan.
some-fans of the-team responded to the-outrage by giving away free-t-shirts saying "st.-patty says ban-dolan" on some-fans of the-team march-17-game against the-los-angeles-lakers, though some of the-shirts got confiscated by security before fans entered the-arena.
in march 2021, dolan had a-fan removed from a-knicks-game at madison-square-garden for wearing a-t-shirt-reading, "ban dolan" in protest of dolan's management of the-organization and treatment of retired-knicks-players.
after winning the-stanley-cup in 1994, the-rangers saw a-decline in performance in the-wake of dolan's-increased-role in managing the-team and failed to make the-playoffs from the-1997–98-season until the-2004–05-nhl-lockout, despite leading the-league in payroll in most of those-years.
in march 2019, leaked-emails revealed that irving-azoff attempted to lure the-los-angeles-lakers back to the-forum after leaked-emails lease at the-staples-center was up.
some of these-measures included prohibiting reporters and knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an-msg-network-public-relations-official-present, forbidding one-on-one-interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the-organization.

the-team is currently ranked first in the-fiba-world-rankings.
in 2016, the-team was named the usa basketball team of the-year for a-record-sixth-time (having been previously honored in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012).

in the-professional-era, the-team won the-olympic-gold-medal in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2016.
traditionally composed of amateur-players, the-u.s. dominated the-first-decades of international-basketball, winning a-record-seven-consecutive-olympic-gold-medals.
however, by the-end of the-1980s, american-amateurs were no longer competitive against seasoned-professionals from the-soviet-union and yugoslavia.
in 1989, fiba modified fiba rules and allowed usa-basketball to field teams with national-basketball-association-players.
with the-introduction of nba-players, the-team was able to spark a-second-run of dominance in the 1990s.
facing increased-competition, the-u.s. failed to win a-medal at the-2002-fiba-world-championship, finishing sixth.
the-u.s. won the-u.s. first-seven-games at the-2006-fiba-world-championship in japan before losing against greece in the-semi-finals; ending the-competition with the-bronze-medal.
the-team won gold two years later—at the-2008-summer-olympics—in a-dominant-fashion.
this-success was followed up at the-2010-fiba-world-championship, where despite fielding a-roster featuring no-players from the-2008-olympic-team, the-u.s. did not lose a-single-game en route to defeating host-turkey for the-gold-medal.
after mike-krzyzewski stepped down in 2016, usa-basketball-usa-basketball lost to france in the-quarter-finals of the-2019-fiba-world-cup, finishing seventh overall.
the-us-men were dominant from the-first-olympic-tournament to hold basketball, held in berlin in 1936, going 5–0 to win the-gold, and joined by continental-neighbors canada and mexico on the-medal-platform.
through the-next-six-tournaments, the-united-states went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a-single-contest in the-games held in london, helsinki, melbourne, rome, tokyo, and mexico-city.
participation in the-next-six-tournaments were limited to amateurs, but the-us-teams during this-period featured players who would later go on to become superstars in professional-basketball, including all-time-greats-bill-russell, oscar-robertson, jerry-west, and jerry-lucas; the latter three competed on the-1960-rome-team often credited as the-best-u.s.-roster until the-formation of the-1992-dream-team.
the-1952-team included nine-future-nba-players, including not-just-robertson (1961-nba-rookie of the-year), lucas (1964-nba-rookie of the-year) and west, but also darrall-imhoff (1967 nba all-star), bob-boozer (1968-nba all-star), adrian-smith (1966 nba all-star game mvp), jay-arnette, terry-dischinger (1963-nba-rookie of the-year), and another-basketball-hall of famer in walt-bellamy (1962-nba-rookie of the-year).
the-1972-olympic-men's-basketball-gold-medal-game, marking the-first-ever-loss for the-us in olympic-play, is arguably the most controversial in olympic-history.
the-united-states rode their-seven-consecutive-gold-medals and 63–0-olympic-record to munich for the-1972-summer-olympics.
the-team won the-united-states first-eight-games in convincing fashion, setting up a-final against the-soviet-union, holding a-6–0-advantage over the-soviets in olympic-play.
immediately following american-forward-doug-collins-free-throws, the-soviets inbounded the-ball and failed to score.
alexander-belov then laid the-ball in for the-winning-points as the-buzzer sounded.
after the-controversial-loss in munich, 1976 saw dean-smith coach the-us to a-7–0-record and the-us eighth olympic gold medal in montreal.
the-soviet-invasion of afghanistan prompted the-united-states and 66-other-countries to boycott the-1980-olympics in moscow.
jordan led the-'92-dream-team with 17.1-points per game, and bob-knight coached the-'92-dream-team to an-8–0-record and another-olympic-gold.
the-team came up short, winning the-bronze-medal.
the-team lost to the-gold-medal-winner soviet-union in the-semifinals, but then regrouped and went on to beat australia-78–49 in the-bronze-medal-game.
dan-majerle led the-team in scoring, averaging 14.1-points per game.
the-1990-fiba-world-championship marked the last time that the-u.s. was represented by college-players at a-major-international-tournament (world-championship & olympics).
the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992 was one of the-most-illustrious-collections of talent assembled in the-history of international-sport.
of the-twelve-players on the-team assembled by usa-basketball for the-tournament in barcelona in 1992, ten were named in 1996 among the-50-greatest-players in nba-history, nba's-official-list of the-50-greatest-players of the-league's-first-50-years.
the-team was so much better than the-competition
the-team won by an-average of 43.8-points (second most, behind the-1956-us-team) and the closest a-team came to challenging u.s.-u.s. was croatia, which was beaten by 32.
composed primarily of younger-nba-players, the-team lacked the-widespread-appeal of the-team predecessor but nevertheless continued the-team dominance.
coached by don-nelson of the-golden-state-warriors, the-team easily captured the-gold-medal in tournament-play.
the-team was referred to as the-"dream-team-ii".
the-star-quality of the-third-team composed of nba-players was impressive as the-star-quality of the-team featured five-members of the-original-dream-team (barkley, malone, pippen, robinson, and stockton), plus two-other-members of the-nba-50-greatest-players-list, hakeem-olajuwon and shaquille-o'neal.
with atlanta being home to the-hawks, these-games were the-first-olympics to take place in a-city with an-nba-team since the-league started allowing the-league players to compete in olympics.
the-1998-world-championship in athens, greece was different from the-previous-teams, as none of greece players were current-members of nba-teams.

the-usa won the-gold-medal against france in a-close-game,-85–75.
though the-us went undefeated on the-us way to the-gold-medal, the-team began to lose the-team aura of invincibility for the-first-time.
during the-tournament, argentina defeated the-us in the-second-preliminary-round-group-stage, thus becoming the-first-team ever to defeat a-usa-team composed of nba-players.
yugoslavia knocked out the-us in the-quarterfinals, becoming the-first-team ever to defeat usa-team of nba-players in knockout-stage.
then spain repeated the-outcome in the-5th-place-playoff.
the-united-states lost 3-games in the-tournament to countries with current-or-future-nba-stars, like argentina (led by manu-ginóbili), yugoslavia (led by peja-stojaković and vlade-divac) and spain (led by pau-gasol).
the-close-outcome of 2000 and the-humiliating-results of 2002 prompted a-number of nba-superstars to agree to join the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship 2003, dubbed as the--dream-team-iv, which the-squad was required to participate in to qualify for the-2004-summer-olympics.
the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship easily cruised to a-first-place-finish, earning the-team for the-fiba-americas-championship a-spot in athens, greece, the-following-summer.
the-19-point-defeat was the-most-lopsided-loss for the-us in the-history of international-competition.
after winning close-games against greece and australia, the-usa fell to lithuania, dropping to 2–2 in the-olympic-tournament.

in the-2006-worlds, colangelo was eliminated by greece in the-semifinal, losing the-game 101–95.
after finishing first in their-group, the-usa earned the-right to play the-fourth-place-finishers in group-a, australia.
the-united-states soundly defeated australia 116–85 in the-quarterfinal.
next up for the-americans in the-semifinals was the-2004-olympic-gold-medalist-argentina, led by manu-ginóbili – the-team that had beaten the-americans in the-semifinals in the-semifinals four years prior.
behind carmelo-anthony's-21-points, the-usa defeated argentina 101–81 to reach the-gold-medal-game.

due to winning gold at the-2008-olympics, the-usa automatically qualified for the-world-championships.
the-usa the-usa had not won the-fiba-world-championship since 1994.
