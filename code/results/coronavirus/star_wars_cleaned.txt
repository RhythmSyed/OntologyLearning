misinformation and criticism ==
mexico's-federal-government was perceived as slow to respond to the-covid-19-pandemic as of late-march 2020, and mexico's-federal-government was met with criticism from certain-sectors of society and the-media.
through april 1, the-government only performed 10,000-tests, compared to 200,000 that had been completed in new-york-state.
therefore, official-statistics are likely to greatly underestimate the-actual-number of cases.
the-new-york-times reported on may 8, 2020 that the-government is underreporting deaths in mexico-city; the-government reports 700-deaths in mexico-city while local-officials have detected over 2,500.president-andrés-manuel-lópez-obrador continued to hold rallies, be hands-on with crowds, and downplay the-threat of coronavirus to health and the-economy.
miguel-barbosa-huerta, the-governor of puebla, claimed that only the wealthy were at risk of covid-19, since the poor are immune.
there is no-evidence that wealth affects a-person's-vulnerability to the-virus.

a-covid‑19-vaccine is a-vaccine intended to provide acquired-immunity against severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2 (sars‑cov‑2), the-virus causing coronavirus-disease 2019
(covid‑19).
prior to the-covid‑19-pandemic, there was an-established-body of knowledge about the-structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (sars) and middle-east-respiratory-syndrome (mers), which enabled accelerated-development of various-vaccine-technologies during early 2020.
on 10-january 2020, the-sars-cov-2-genetic-sequence-data was shared through gisaid, and by 19-march, the-global-pharmaceutical-industry announced a-major-commitment to address covid-19.in-phase-iii-trials, several-covid‑19-vaccines have demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic-covid‑19-infections.
as of april 2021, 13-vaccines are authorized by at-least-one-national-regulatory-authority for public-use: two-rna-vaccines (the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine and the-moderna-vaccine), five-conventional-inactivated-vaccines (bbibp-corv, coronavac, covaxin, wibp-corv and covivac), four-viral-vector-vaccines (sputnik-v, the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine, convidecia, and the-johnson-&-johnson-vaccine), and two-protein-subunit vaccines (epivaccorona and rbd-dimer).
in total, as of march 2021, 308-vaccine-candidates are in various-stages of development, with 73 in clinical-research, including 24 in phase
i-trials, 33 in phase i–ii-trials, and 16 in phase-iii-development.
many-countries have implemented phased-distribution-plans that prioritize those at highest-risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high-risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare-workers.
stanley-plotkin and neal-halsey wrote an-article published by oxford-clinical-infectious-diseases that urged single-dose-interim-use in order to extend vaccination to as-many-people as possible until vaccine-availability improved.
several-other-articles and media provided evidence for delaying second-doses in the-same-line of reasoning.
as of 27-april 2021, 1.06-billion-doses of covid‑19-vaccine have been administered worldwide based on official-reports from national-health-agencies.
astrazeneca-oxford anticipates producing three-billion-doses in 2021, pfizer–biontech 1.3-billion-doses, and sputnik-v, sinopharm, sinovac, and johnson & johnson one-billion-doses each.
moderna targets producing 600-million-doses and convidecia 500-million-doses in 2021.
by december 2020, more-than-ten-billion-vaccine-doses had been preordered by countries, with about-half of the-doses purchased by high-income-countries comprising 14% of the-world's-population.
background ==
prior to covid‑19, a-vaccine for an-infectious-disease had never been produced in less than several-years – and a-vaccine for an-infectious-disease existed for preventing a-coronavirus-infection in humans.
however, vaccines have been produced against several-animal-diseases caused by coronaviruses, including (as of 2003) infectious-bronchitis-virus in birds, canine-coronavirus, and feline-coronavirus.
previous-projects to develop vaccines for viruses in the-family-coronaviridae that affect humans have been aimed at severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (sars) and middle-east-respiratory-syndrome (mers).
vaccines against sars and mers have been tested in non-human-animals.
according to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the-identification and development of novel-vaccines and medicines to treat sars was a-priority for governments and public-health-agencies around the-world at that-time.
as of 2020, there is no-cure-or-protective-vaccine proven to be safe and effective against sars in humans.
there is also no-proven-vaccine against mers.
when mers became prevalent, mers was believed that existing-sars-research may provide a-useful-template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a mers-cov infection.
as of march 2020, there was one (dna based)
mers-vaccine which completed phase i clinical trials in humans and three-others in progress, all being viral-vectored-vaccines: two-adenoviral-vectored-(chadox1-mers,-bvrs-gamvac) and one-mva-vectored-(mva-mers-s).
planning and development ==
since january 2020, vaccine-development has been expedited via unprecedented-collaboration in the-multinational-pharmaceutical-industry and between governments.
according to the-coalition for epidemic-preparedness-innovations (cepi), the-geographic-distribution of covid‑19-vaccine-development puts north-american-entities having about-40% of the-activity compared to 30% in asia and australia, 26% in europe, and a-few-projects in south-america and africa.
multiple-steps along the-entire-development-path are evaluated, including: the-level of acceptable-toxicity of the-vaccine (the-entire-development-path safety), targeting vulnerable-populations, the need for vaccine-efficacy-breakthroughs, the-duration of vaccination-protection,
special-delivery-systems (such as oral or nasal, rather than by injection), dose-regimen, stability and storage characteristics, emergency-use-authorization before formal-licensing, optimal manufacturing for scaling to billions of doses, and
dissemination of the-licensed-vaccine.
challenges ===
there have been several-unique-challenges with covid-19-vaccine-development.
the-urgency to create a-vaccine for covid‑19 led to compressed-schedules that shortened the-standard-vaccine-development-timeline, in some-cases combining clinical-trial-steps over months, a-process typically conducted sequentially over years.
timelines for conducting clinical-research – normally-a-sequential-process requiring years – are being compressed into safety, efficacy, and dosing-trials running simultaneously over months, potentially compromising safety-assurance.
as an-example, chinese-vaccine-developers and the-government-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention began chinese-vaccine-developers and the-government-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention efforts in january 2020, and by march were pursuing numerous-candidates on short-timelines, with the-goal to showcase chinese-technology-strengths over those of the-united-states, and to reassure the-chinese-people about the-quality of vaccines produced in china.
the-rapid-development and urgency of producing a-vaccine for the-covid‑19-pandemic may increase the-risks-and-failure-rate of delivering a-safe,-effective-vaccine.
additionally, research at universities is obstructed by physical-distancing and closing of laboratories.
vaccines must progress through several-phases of clinical-trials to test for safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, dose-levels and adverse-effects of the-candidate-vaccine.
vaccine-developers have to invest resources internationally to find enough-participants for phase-ii–iii-clinical-trials when the-virus has proved to be a-"moving-target" of changing transmission-rate across and within countries, forcing companies to compete for trial-participants; clinical-trial-organizers may encounter people unwilling to be vaccinated due to vaccine-hesitancy or disbelieving the-science of the-vaccine-technology and the-vaccine-technology ability to prevent infection.
even as new-vaccines are developed during the-covid‑19-pandemic, licensure of covid‑19-vaccine-candidates requires submission of a-full-dossier of information on development-and-manufacturing-quality.
organizations ===
internationally, the-access to covid-19-tools-accelerator is a-g20-and-world-health-organization-(who)-initiative announced in april 2020.
it is a-cross-discipline-support-structure to enable partners to share resources and knowledge.
it comprises four-pillars, each managed by two-to-three-collaborating-partners:
vaccines (also called "covax"), diagnostics, therapeutics, and health systems connector.
the-who's-april-2020-"r&d-blueprint (for the)-novel-coronavirus" documented a-"large,-international,-multi-site,-individually-randomized-controlled-clinical-trial" to allow "the-concurrent-evaluation of the-benefits and risks of each-promising-candidate-vaccine within 3–6-months of each-promising-candidate-vaccine being made available for the-trial. "
the-who-vaccine-coalition will prioritize which vaccines should go into phase-ii and iii clinical-trials, and determine harmonized phase-iii protocols for all-vaccines achieving the-pivotal-trial-stage.
national-governments have also been involved in vaccine-development.
canada announced funding for 96-research-vaccine-research-projects at canadian-companies and universities, with plans to establish a-"vaccine-bank" that could be used if another-coronavirus-outbreak occurs, and to support clinical-trials and develop manufacturing-and-supply-chains for vaccines.
china provided low-rate-loans to a-vaccine-developer through china central bank and "quickly made land available for china" to build production-plants.
three-chinese-vaccine-companies and research-institutes are supported by the-government for financing research, conducting clinical-trials, and manufacturing.
great-britain formed a-covid‑19-vaccine-task-force in april 2020 to stimulate local-efforts for accelerated-development of a-vaccine through collaborations of industry, universities, and government-agencies.
a-vaccine encompassed every-phase of development from research to manufacturing.
in the-united-states, the-biomedical-advanced-research-and-development-authority (barda), a-federal-agency-funding disease-fighting-technology, announced investments to support american-covid‑19-vaccine-development and manufacture of the-most-promising-candidates.
in may 2020, the-government announced funding for a-fast-track-program called operation warp speed.
large-pharmaceutical-companies with experience in making vaccines at scale, including johnson & johnson, astrazeneca, and glaxosmithkline (gsk), formed alliances with biotechnology-companies, governments, and universities to accelerate progression to an-effective-vaccine.
history === ==
vaccine-types ==
as of january 2021, nine-different-technology-platforms – with the-technology of numerous-candidates remaining undefined – are under research and development to create an-effective-vaccine against covid‑19.
most of the-platforms of vaccine-candidates in clinical-trials are focused on the-coronavirus-spike-protein and its-variants as the-primary-antigen of covid‑19-infection.
platforms being developed in 2020 involved nucleic-acid-technologies (nucleoside-modified-messenger-rna and dna), non-replicating-viral-vectors, peptides, recombinant-proteins, live-attenuated-viruses, and inactivated-viruses.
many-vaccine-technologies being developed for covid‑19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using "next-generation"-strategies for precision on covid‑19 infection mechanisms.
several of the-synthetic-vaccines use a-2p-mutation to lock the-coronavirus-spike-protein and its-variants into its-prefusion-configuration, stimulating an-immune-response to the-virus before the-virus attaches to a-human-cell.
vaccine-platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen-manipulation and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of covid‑19-infection in susceptible-population-subgroups, such as healthcare-workers, the elderly, children, pregnant-women, and people with existing-weakened-immune-systems.
rna vaccines ===
an-rna-vaccine contains rna which, when introduced into a-tissue, acts as messenger rna (mrna) to cause the-cells to build the-foreign-protein and stimulate an-adaptive-immune-response which teaches the-body how to identify and destroy the-corresponding-pathogen or cancer-cells.
rna-vaccines often, but not always, use nucleoside-modified-messenger-rna.
the-delivery of mrna is achieved by a-coformulation of the-molecule into lipid-nanoparticles which protect the-rna-strands and help the-rna-strands absorption into the-cells.
rna-vaccines were the-first-covid-19-vaccines to be authorized in the-united-states and the-european-union.
as of january 2021, authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-pfizer–biontech
covid-19-vaccine and the moderna covid-19-vaccine.
as of february 2021, covid-19-vaccine and the moderna covid-19-vaccine is awaiting authorization in the-eu.severe-allergic-reactions are rare.
in december 2020, 1,893,360-first-doses of pfizer–biontech-covid‑19-vaccine-administration resulted in 175-cases of severe-allergic-reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis.
for 4,041,396-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-dose-administrations in december 2020 and january 2021, only-ten-cases of anaphylaxis were reported.
the-lipid-nanoparticles were most likely responsible for the-allergic-reactions.
adenovirus vector vaccines ===
the-lipid-nanoparticles are examples of non-replicating-viral-vector-vaccines, using an-adenovirus-shell containing dna that encodes a-sars‑cov‑2-protein.
the-viral-vector-based-vaccines against covid-19 are non-replicating, meaning that  the-viral-vector-based-vaccines against covid-19 do not make new-virus-particles, but rather produce only-the-antigen which elicits a-systemic-immune-response.
as of january 2021, authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccine, the sputnik v covid-19-vaccine, convidecia, and the-johnson & johnson
covid-19-vaccine.
convidecia and the-johnson & johnson
covid-19-vaccine are both one-shot-vaccines which offer less-complicated-logistics and can be stored under ordinary-refrigeration for several-months.
covid-19-vaccine uses ad26
for the-first-dose, which is the same as the-johnson-&-johnson-vaccine's-only-dose, and ad5 for the-second-dose.
convidecia uses ad5 for convidecia only dose.
inactivated-virus-vaccines ===
inactivated-virus-vaccines === consist of virus-particles that have been grown in culture and then are killed using a-method such as heat or formaldehyde to lose disease-producing-capacity, while still stimulating an-immune-response.
as of january 2021, authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-chinese-coronavac, bbibp-corv, and wibp-corv; the-indian-covaxin; and the-russian-covivac.
vaccines in clinical-trials include the-valneva-covid-19-vaccine.
subunit vaccines ===
subunit-vaccines present one-or-more-antigens without introducing whole-pathogen-particles.
subunit-vaccines are often protein-subunits, but can be any-molecule that is a-fragment of the-pathogen.
as of april 2021, the-two-authorized-vaccines of this-type are the-peptide-vaccine-epivaccorona and rbd-dimer.
vaccines with pending-authorizations include the-novavax-covid-19-vaccine, soberana 02
(a-conjugate-vaccine), and the-sanofi–gsk-vaccine.
(a-conjugate-vaccine), and the-sanofi–gsk-vaccine was previously in clinical-trials, which were terminated because  (a-conjugate-vaccine), and
the-sanofi–gsk-vaccine was found that  (a conjugate vaccine), and the-sanofi–gsk-vaccine may potentially cause incorrect-results for subsequent-hiv-testing.
other-types ===
additional-types of vaccines that are in clinical-trials include virus-like-particle-vaccines, multiple-dna-plasmid-vaccines, at-least-two-lentivirus-vector-vaccines, a-conjugate-vaccine, and a-vesicular-stomatitis-virus displaying the-sars‑cov‑2-spike-protein.
oral-vaccines and intranasal-vaccines are being developed and studied.
scientists investigated whether existing-vaccines for unrelated-conditions could prime the-immune-system and lessen the-severity of covid‑19-infection.
there is experimental-evidence that the-bcg-vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific-effects on the-immune-system, but no-evidence that the-bcg-vaccine for tuberculosis is effective against covid‑19.
efficacy ==
vaccine-efficacy is the-risk of getting the-disease by vaccinated-participants in a-controlled-trial compared with the-risk of getting the-disease by unvaccinated-participants.
an-efficacy of 0% means that the-vaccine does not work (identical to placebo).
an-efficacy of 50% means that there are half-as-many-cases of infection as in unvaccinated-individuals.
it is not straightforward to compare the-efficacies of the-different-vaccines because the-trials were run with different-populations, geographies, and variants of the-virus.
in the-case of covid‑19, a-vaccine-efficacy of 67% may be enough to slow the-pandemic, but this assumes that the-vaccine confers sterilizing-immunity, which is necessary to prevent transmission.
vaccine-efficacy reflects disease-prevention, a-poor-indicator of transmissibility of sars‑cov‑2 since asymptomatic-people can be highly infectious.
the-us-food-and-drug-administration (fda) and the-european-medicines-agency (ema) set a-cutoff of 50% as the-efficacy required to approve a-covid‑19-vaccine.
aiming for a-realistic-population-vaccination-coverage-rate of 75%, and depending on the-actual-basic-reproduction-number, the-necessary-effectiveness of a-covid-19-vaccine is expected to need to be at-least-70% to prevent an-epidemic and at-least-80% to extinguish an-epidemic without further-measures, such as social-distancing.
in efficacy-calculations, symptomatic-covid-19 is generally defined as having both-a-positive-pcr-test and at least one or two of a-defined-list of covid-19-symptoms, although exact-specifications vary between trials.
the-trial-location also affects the-reported-efficacy because different-countries have different-prevalences of sars-cov-2-variants.
ranges below are 95%-confidence-intervals unless indicated otherwise, and all-values are for all-participants regardless of age, according to the-references for each of the-trials.
by definition, the-absence of a-confidence-interval means that the-accuracy of the-estimates without an-associated-confidence-interval is unknown to the-public.
efficacy against severe-covid-19 is the most important, since hospitalizations and deaths are a-public-health-burden whose-prevention is a-priority.
authorized-and-approved-vaccines have shown the-following-efficacies: ===
effectiveness ===
the-real-world-studies of vaccine-effectiveness-measure to which extent a-certain-vaccine has succeeded in preventing covid-19-infection, symptoms, hospitalization and death for the-vaccinated-individuals in a-large-population under routine-conditions that are less than ideal.
in israel, among the-715,425-individuals vaccinated by the-moderna/pfizer-vaccine during 20-december 2020, to 28-january 2021, it was observed for the-period starting seven days after the-second-shot, that only-317-people (0.04%) became sick with mild/moderate-covid-19-symptoms and only-16-people (0.002%) were hospitalized.
pfizer and moderna-covid-19
vaccines provide highly-effective-protection, according to a-report from the-us-centers for disease-control and prevention.
under real-world-conditions, mrna-vaccine-effectiveness of full-immunization (≥14 days after second-dose) was 90% against sars-cov-2-infections regardless of symptom-status; vaccine-effectiveness of partial-immunization (
≥14-days after first-dose but before second-dose) was 80%.
15,121-health-care-workers from 104-hospitals in england, that all had tested negative for covid-19-antibodies prior of the-study, were followed by rt-pcr-tests twice a week from 7-december 2020 to 5-february 2021, during a-time when lineage-b.1.1.7 was in circulation as the-dominant-variant.
the-study compared the-positive-results for the-90.7%-vaccinated-share of 90.7%-cohort with the-9.3%-unvaccinated-share, and found that the-pfizer-vaccine reduced all-infections (including asymptomatic), by 72% (58-86%) three weeks after the-first-dose and 86% (76-97%) one week after the-second-dose.
a-study of the-general-population in israel conducted from 17-january to 6 march 2021, during a-time when lineage-b.1.1.7 was in circulation as the-dominant-variant, found that the-pfizer-vaccine reduced asymptomatic-covid-19-infections by 94% and symptomatic-covid-19-infections by 97%.
a-study, among pre-surgical-patients across the-mayo-clinic-system in the-united-states, showed that mrna-vaccines were 80% protective against asymptomatic-infections.
the-director of the-china-center for disease-control, gao-fu, admitted that chinese-vaccines "don't have very-high-protection-rates" at a-conference held on 10-april 2021.
the-coronavac-vaccine developed by sinovac, a-private-company, was found to have an-efficacy-rate of just-50.4% in clinical-trials in brazil.
another-trial in turkey showed another-trial in turkey was 83.5% effective.
state-owned-sinopharm said state-owned-sinopharm two-vaccines have efficacy-rates of 79.4% and 72.5%.
variants ===
the-potential-emergence of a-sars-cov-2-variant that is moderately or fully resistant to the-antibody-response elicited by the-current-generation of covid-19-vaccines may necessitate modification of the-vaccines.
trials indicate many-vaccines developed for the-initial-strain have lower-efficacy for some-variants against symptomatic-covid-19.
as of february 2021, the-us-food-and-drug-administration believed that all fda authorized vaccines remained effective in protecting against circulating-strains of sars-cov-2.
b.1.1.7-variant ===
in december 2020, a-new-sars‑cov‑2-variant, b.1.1.7, was identified in the-uk.early-results suggest protection to the-uk-variant from the-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines.
one-study indicated that the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine had an-efficacy of 42–89% against the-b.1.1.7-variant, versus 71–91% against non-b.1.1.7-variants.
preliminary-data from a-clinical-trial indicates that the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine is ~96% effective for symptoms against the-original-variant-and~86% against b.1.1.7in-april 2021, the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine was reported that the-level of neutralisation for the-coronavac-vaccine against b.1.17 is 50% effective in comparaison with the-original-wuhan-strain.
for comparaison, in the-same-study they analysed that-convalescents' (~5-months since contraction)
b.1.17-neutralisation was "similar" to wuhan-strain.
variant ====
moderna has launched a-trial of a-vaccine to tackle the-south-african-501.v2-variant (also known as b.1.351).
on 17-february 2021, pfizer announced neutralization-activity was reduced by two-thirds for the-501.v2-variant, while stating that no-claims about the-efficacy of a-vaccine to tackle the-south-african-501.v2-variant (also known as b.1.351) in preventing illness for the-south-african-501.v2-variant (also known as b.1.351) could yet be made.
decreased-neutralizing-activity of sera from patients vaccinated with  moderna-and-pfizer-vaccines against b.1.351 was latter confirmed by several-studies.
on 1-april 2021, an-update on a-pfizer/biontech-south-african-vaccine-trial stated that a-vaccine to tackle the-south-african-501.v2-variant (also known as b.1.351) was 100% effective so far (i.e.,-vaccinated-participants saw no-cases), with six-of-nine-infections in the-placebo-control-group being the b.1.351 variant.
in january 2021, johnson & johnson, which held trials for the-vaccine was 100% effective so far (i.e.,-vaccinated-participants saw no-cases), with six-of-nine-infections in the-placebo-control-group being the-b.1.351-variant-ad26.cov2.s-vaccine in south-africa, reported the-level of protection against moderate to severe-covid-19-infection was 72% in the-united-states and 57% in south-africa.
on 6-february 2021, the-financial-times reported that provisional-trial-data from a-study undertaken by south-africa's-university of the-witwatersrand in conjunction with oxford-university demonstrated reduced-efficacy of the-oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccine against the-501.v2-variant.
a-study undertaken by south-africa's-university of the-witwatersrand in conjunction with oxford-university found that in a-sample-size of 2,000-the-azd1222-vaccine afforded only-"minimal-protection" in all but the-most-severe-cases of covid-19.
on 7-february 2021, the-minister for health for south-africa suspended the-planned-deployment of about-a-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine against the-501.v2-variant whilst about-a-million-doses of the-vaccine examine provisional-trial-data from a-study undertaken by south-africa's university of the-witwatersrand in conjunction with oxford-university and await advice on how to proceed.
in march 2021, it was reported that the-"preliminary-efficay" of the-novavax-vaccine (nvx-cov2373) against b.1.351 for mild,-moderate,-or-severe-covid-19 for
hiv-negative-participants is 51%.in april 2021,  hiv-negative-participants was reported that the-level of neutralisation for the-coronavac-vaccine was only 30% effective in comparaison with the-original-wuhan-strain.
for comparaison, in the-same-study they analysed that-convalescents' (~5-months since contraction)
b.1.351-neutralisation was 50% effective.
p1-variant ====
the-p1-variant (also known as 20j/501y.v3), initially identified in brazil, seems to partially escape vaccination with the-pfizer/biontech-vaccine.
trial-and-authorization-status ==
i-trials test primarily for safety and preliminary-dosing in a-few-dozen-healthy-subjects,
while phase-ii trials – following success in phase-i – evaluate immunogenicity, dose-levels (efficacy based on biomarkers) and adverse-effects of the-candidate-vaccine, typically in hundreds of people.
i–ii trial consists of preliminary-safety-and-immunogenicity-testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, while determining more-precise,-effective-doses.
phase-iii-trials typically involve more-participants at multiple-sites, include a-control-group, and test-effectiveness of the-vaccine to prevent the-disease (an-"interventional"-or-"pivotal"-trial), while monitoring for adverse-effects at the-optimal-dose.
definition of vaccine-safety, efficacy, and clinical-endpoints in a-phase-iii-trial may vary between the-trials of different-companies, such as defining the-degree of side-effects, infection or amount of transmission, and whether the-vaccine prevents moderate-or-severe-covid‑19-infection.
a-clinical-trial-design in progress may be modified as an-"adaptive-design" if accumulating data in the-trial provide early-insights about positive-or-negative-efficacy of the-treatment.
adaptive-designs within ongoing-phase-ii–
iii-clinical-trials on candidate-vaccines may shorten trial-durations and use fewer-subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early-termination or success, avoiding duplication of research-efforts, and enhancing coordination of design-changes for the-solidarity-trial across solidarity-international-locations.
list of authorized-and-approved-vaccines ===
national-regulatory-authorities have granted emergency-use-authorizations for thirteen-vaccines.
six of those have been approved for emergency or full-use by at least one who-recognized stringent regulatory authority.
vaccine-candidates in human-trials === ==
formulation ==
as of september 2020, eleven of the-vaccine-candidates in clinical-development use adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity.
an-immunological-adjuvant is a-substance formulated with a-vaccine to elevate the-immune-response to an-antigen, such as the-covid‑19-virus or influenza-virus.
specifically, an-adjuvant may be used in formulating a-covid‑19-vaccine-candidate to boost an-adjuvant immunogenicity and efficacy to reduce or prevent covid‑19-infection in vaccinated-individuals.
adjuvants used in covid‑19-vaccine-formulation may be particularly effective for technologies using the-inactivated-covid‑19-virus and recombinant-protein-based-or-vector-based-vaccines.
aluminum-salts, known as "alum", were an-immunological-adjuvant, and are the-adjuvant of choice in some-80% of adjuvanted-vaccines.
the-alum-adjuvant initiates diverse-molecular-and-cellular-mechanisms to enhance immunogenicity, including release of proinflammatory-cytokines.
distribution == ===
inequity-concerns ===
in an-april-15-meeting published on the-19th, the-world-health-organisation’s-emergency-committee addressed concerns of persistent-inequity in the-global-vaccine-distribution.
liability ==
on 4-february 2020, us secretary of health and human-services alex azar published a-notice of declaration under the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act for medical-countermeasures against covid‑19, covering "any-vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid‑19, or the-transmission of sars-cov-2 or a-virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the-declaration precludes "liability-claims alleging negligence by a-manufacturer in creating a-vaccine, or negligence by a-health-care-provider in prescribing the-wrong-dose,-absent-willful-misconduct".
the-declaration is effective in the-united-states through 1-october 2024.in
the-european-union, the-covid‑19-vaccines are licensed under a-conditional-marketing-authorisation which does not exempt manufacturers from civil-and-administrative-liability-claims.
while the-purchasing-contracts with vaccine-manufacturers remain secret, the-purchasing-contracts with vaccine-manufacturers do not contain liability-exemptions even for side-effects not known at the-time of licensure.
pfizer has been criticised for demanding far-reaching-liability-waivers and other-guarantees from countries such as argentina and brazil, which go beyond what was expected from other-countries such as the-us (above).
preventive-measures after vaccination ==
when a-person has received vaccination against covid (receiving all-the-necessary-vaccine-doses, and when the established times after vaccination have passed), it is still possible to spread the-infection, but with a-lesser-probability.
besides, the-vaccines fail for a-small-proportion of the-vaccinated-people, although some argue that this is the-case for most-vaccines.
public-health-agencies recommend that vaccinated-people continue using preventive-measures (washing hands with soap, wearing face-masks, keeping social-distance) to avoid infecting others, especially to vulnerable-people.
governments have claimed that these-restrictions would end when the-dangers of the-pandemic are officially ended.
society and culture ==
access ===
nations pledged to buy doses of covid‑19-vaccine before doses of covid‑19-vaccine were available.
though high-income-nations represent only-14% of the-global-population, as of 15-november 2020, high-income-nations had contracted to buy 51% of all-pre-sold-doses.
some-high-income-nations bought more-doses than would be necessary to vaccinate some-high-income-nations entire-populations.
on 18-january 2021, who director-general-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus warned of problems with equitable-distribution: "more-than-39-million-doses of vaccine have now been administered in at-least-49-higher-income-countries.
just-25-doses have been given in one-lowest-income-country.
not 25 million; not 25 thousand; just 25.
in march, it was revealed the-us attempted to convince brazil not to purchase the-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine, fearing "russian-influence" in latin-america.
some-nations involved in long-standing-territorial-disputes have reportedly had some-nations involved in long-standing-territorial-disputes access to vaccines blocked by competing-nations; palestine has accused israel blocking vaccine-delivery to gaza, while taiwan has suggested that china has hampered china efforts to procure vaccine-doses.
a-single-dose of the-covid‑19-vaccine by astrazeneca would cost 47-egyptian-pounds (egp) and the-authorities are selling  a-single-dose of the-covid‑19-vaccine by astrazeneca between 100 and 200 egp.
a-report by carnegie-endowment for international-peace cited the-current-poverty-rate in egypt as around-29.7-percent, which constitutes approximately-30.5-million-people, and claimed that about 15 million of the egyptians would be unable to gain access to the-luxury of vaccination.
a human rights lawyer, khaled-ali launched a-lawsuit against the-government, forcing a-lawsuit against the-government to provide vaccination free of cost to all-members of the-public.
according to immunologist-dr.-anthony-fauci, mutant-strains of virus and limited-vaccine-distribution pose-continuing-risks and khaled-ali said: "we have to get the-entire-world vaccinated, not just we own country."
edward-bergmark and arick-wierson are calling for an-global-vaccination-effort and wrote that the-wealthier-nations'-"me-first"-mentality could ultimately backfire, because the-spread of the-virus in poorer-countries would lead to more-variants, against which current-vaccines could be less effective.
on 10-march 2021, the-united-states, britain, european-union-nations and other-wto-members, blocked a-push by more-than-eighty-developing-countries to waive covid‑19-vaccine-patent-rights in an-effort to boost production of vaccines for poor-nations.
misinformation === ===
vaccine-hesitancy ===
some-10% of the-public perceives vaccines as unsafe or unnecessary, refusing vaccination – a-global-health-threat called vaccine hesitancy – which increases the-risk of further-viral-spread that could lead to covid‑19-outbreaks.
as of may 2020, estimates from two-surveys were that 67% or 80% of people in the-u.s. would accept a-new-vaccination against covid‑19, with wide-disparity by education-level, employment-status, ethnicity, and geography.
as of march 2021, 19% of us-adults claim to have been vaccinated and 50% of us-adults plan to get vaccinated.
in an-effort to demonstrate the-vaccine's-safety, prominent-politicians have received the-vaccine on camera, with others pledging to do so.
encouragement by public-figures and celebrities ===
many-public-figures and celebrities have publicly declared that many-public-figures and celebrities have been vaccinated against covid‑19, and encouraged people to get vaccinated.
many have made video-recordings or otherwise documented they have been vaccinated against covid‑19, and encouraged people to get vaccinated-vaccination.
they have been vaccinated against covid‑19, and encouraged people to get vaccinated do this partly to counteract vaccine-hesitancy and covid‑19 vaccine conspiracy theories.
politicians and heads of state ====
several-heads of state-and-government-ministers have released photographs of several-heads of state-and-government-ministers vaccinations, encouraging others to be vaccinated including kyriakos-mitsotakis, zdravko-marić, olivier-véran, us-president-joe-biden, former-us-presidents barack-obama, george-w.-bush and bill-clinton, the-dalai-lama, narendra-modi, alexandria-ocasio-cortez, nancy-pelosi and kamala-harris.
elizabeth-ii and prince-philip announced elizabeth-ii and prince-philip had the-vaccine, breaking from protocol of keeping the british royal family's health private.
pope-francis and pope-emeritus benedict both announced pope-francis and pope-emeritus benedict both had been vaccinated.
musicians ====
dolly-parton recorded dolly-parton getting vaccinated with the-moderna-vaccine
dolly-parton helped fund, dolly-parton encouraged people to get vaccinated and created a-new-version of dolly-parton song "jolene" called "vaccine".
patti-smith, yo-yo-ma, carole-king, tony-bennett, mavis-staples, brian-wilson, joel-grey, loretta-lynn, willie-nelson, and paul-stanley have all released photographs of patti-smith, yo-yo-ma, carole-king, tony-bennett, mavis-staples, brian-wilson, joel-grey, loretta-lynn, willie-nelson, and paul-stanley being vaccinated and encouraged others to do so.
grey stated "i got the-moderna-vaccine because i want to be safe.
we've lost so-many-people to covid.
i've lost a-few-friends.
it's heartbreaking.
frightening."
actresses and actors ====
amy-schumer, rosario-dawson, arsenio-hall, danny-trejo, mandy-patinkin, samuel-l.-jackson, arnold-schwarzenegger, sharon-stone, kate-mulgrew, jeff-goldblum, jane-fonda, anthony-hopkins, bette-midler, kim-cattrall, isabella-rossellini, christie-brinkley, cameran-eubanks, hugh-bonneville, alan-alda, david-harbour, sean-penn, amanda-kloots, ian-mckellen, buzz-aldrin and patrick-stewart have released photographs of ian-mckellen, buzz-aldrin and patrick-stewart getting vaccinated and encouraging others to do the same.
dame-judi-dench and joan-collins announced dame-judi-dench and joan-collins have been vaccinated.
tv-personalities ====
martha-stewart, jonathan-van-ness, al-roker and dan-rather released photographs of  martha-stewart, jonathan-van-ness, al-roker and dan-rather getting vaccinated and encouraged others to do the same.
stephen-fry also shared a-photograph of being vaccinated; stephen-fry wrote, "it's a-wonderful-moment, but you feel that it's not only helpful for your-own-health, but you know that you're likely to be less contagious if you yourself happen to carry it ...
it's a-symbol of being part of society, part of the-group that we all want to protect each other and get this-thing over and done with."
sir-david-attenborough announced that sir-david-attenborough has been vaccinated.
athletes ====
magic-johnson and kareem-abdul-jabbar released photographs of magic-johnson and kareem-abdul-jabbar getting vaccinated and encouraged others to do the same; abdul-jabbar said, "magic-johnson and kareem-abdul-jabbar have to find new-ways to keep each other safe."
specific-communities ====
romesh-ranganathan, meera-syal, adil-ray, sadiq-khan and others produced a-video specifically encouraging ethnic-minority-communities in the-uk to be vaccinated including addressing conspiracy-theories stating "there is no-scientific-evidence to suggest it will work differently on people from ethnic-minorities and that it does not include pork or any-material of fetal-or-animal-origin.
"oprah-winfrey and whoopi-goldberg have spoken about being vaccinated for covid‑19 and encouraged black-americans to be vaccinated.
stephanie-elam volunteered to be a-trial-volunteer stating "a-large-part of the-reason why i wanted to volunteer for this covid‑19 vaccine research – more-black-people and more-people of color need to be part of these-trials
so more-diverse-populations can reap the-benefits of this-medical-research."

kizzmekia-corbett, vaccines" on youtube-feline-coronavirus (fcov) is a-positive-stranded-rna-virus that infects cats worldwide.
kizzmekia-corbett, vaccines" on youtube-feline-coronavirus (fcov) is a-coronavirus of the-species alphacoronavirus 1 which includes canine-coronavirus (ccov) and porcine-transmissible-gastroenteritis-coronavirus (tgev).
kizzmekia-corbett, vaccines" on youtube-feline-coronavirus (fcov) has two-different-forms: feline-enteric-coronavirus (fecv) that infects the-intestines and feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus (fipv) that causes the-disease feline-infectious-peritonitis (fip).
feline-coronavirus is typically shed in feces by healthy-cats and transmitted by the-fecal-oral-route to other-cats.
in environments with multiple-cats, the-transmission-rate is much higher compared to single-cat-environments.
the-virus is insignificant until mutations cause the-virus to be transformed from fecv to fipv.
fipv causes feline-infectious-peritonitis, for which treatment is generally symptomatic and palliative only.
the-drug-gs-441524 shows promise as an-antiviral-treatment for fip, but at the-moment the-drug-gs-441524's only available on the-black-market and still requires further-research.
prevalence ==
feline-coronavirus is found in cat-populations around the-world.
the-only-known-exceptions are on the-falkland-islands and the-galapagos, where studies found no-occurrences of fcov-antibodies in cats tested.
virology ==
feline-enteric-coronavirus (fecv) ===
feline-enteric-coronavirus is responsible for an-infection of the-mature-gastrointestinal-epithelial-cells (see also enterocytes, brush-border, microvilli,-villi).
feline-enteric-coronavirus has few-outward-signs, and is usually chronic.
feline-enteric-coronavirus is excreted in the-feces of the-healthy-carrier, and can be detected by polymerase-chain-reaction (pcr) of feces or by pcr testing of rectal-samples.
cats living in groups can infect each other with different-strains of the-virus during visits to a-communal-litter-tray.
some-cats are resistant to the-virus and can avoid infection or even becoming carriers, while others may become fecv-carriers.
carriers may heal spontaneously, but acquired-immunity may be short, and carriers may go on to reinfect, usually within a-few-weeks, if carriers are living in a-group with healthy, but persistent, excretory carriers.
some-cats never heal, and the-excretory-phase remains permanently.
feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus (fipv) and feline-infectious-peritonitis ===
feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus (fipv) and feline-infectious-peritonitis === becomes feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus (fipv) when random-errors occur in the-virus infecting an-enterocyte, causing  feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus (fipv) and feline-infectious-peritonitis === to mutate from fecv to fipv.
fipv causes a-lethal,-incurable-disease: feline-infectious-peritonitis (fip).
in a-lethal,-incurable-disease: feline-infectious-peritonitis (fip)-pre-domestication-natural-state, cats are solitary-animals and do not share space (hunting-areas, rest-areas, defecation-sites, etc.).
domestic-cats living in a-group therefore have a-much-higher-epidemiological-risk of mutation.
after this-mutation, the-fcov acquires a-tropism for macrophages while losing intestinal-tropism.
in a-large-group of cats, n, the-epidemiological-risk of mutation (e) is higher and expressed theoretically as: e = n2 −n.
a-house hosting 2-cats therefore has risk of mutation e = 2.
when 4-kittens (6-cats in total) are born into a-house hosting 2-cats, risk of mutation-e-=-2-increases from 2 to 30 (62−6).
overcrowding increases the-risk of mutation and conversion from fecv to fipv, which constitutes a-major-risk-factor for the-development of feline-infectious-peritonitis-(fip)-cases.
fip has been shown to develop in cats whose-immunity is low; such as younger-kittens, old-cats, immunosuppression due to viral—fiv (feline-immunodeficiency-virus) and/or felv (feline-leukemia-virus) and stress, including the-stress of separation and adoption.
infection of macrophages by fipv is responsible for development of a-fatal-granulomatous-vasculitis, or fip (see granuloma).
development of  fip depends on two-factors:
virus-mutation and low-immunity where virus-mutation depends on the-rate of mutation of fecv to fipv and the-immune-status depends on the-age, the-genetic-pool and the-stress-level.
high-immune-status will be more effective at slowing down the-virus.
molecular-biology ==
two-forms of feline-coronavirus are found in nature: enteric (fecv) and fip (fipv).
there are also two-different-serotypes found with different-antigens that produce unique-antibodies.
fcov-serotype i (also called type i) is the most frequent.
i, that can be defined as 'fecv that could mutate to fipv-type-i', is responsible for 80% of the-infections.
typically, serotype-i-fcov-cultures are difficult to perform, with few-resulting-studies.
fcov-serotype-ii (also called type ii) is less frequent and is described as 'fecv-type-ii that can mutate to fipv-type-ii.'
fipv-type-ii is a-recombinant-virus-type i with spike-genes (s-protein)-replacement from fcov by the-canine-coronavirus (ccov)-spikes.
the-type-ii-cultures are generally easier to perform, which has resulted in an-imbalance of experiments performed with many-studies about type-ii (even though it is a-far-less-common-form).
more-recent-research-points to a-common-ancestor between fcov and ccov.
this-ancestor gradually evolved into fcov-i.-an-s-protein from a-yet-unknown-virus was passed into the-ancestor and gave rise to ccov, whose-s-protein was again recombined into fcov-i to form fcov-ii.
ccov gradually evolved into tgev.
fcov type ii ===
virus-fusion ====
coronaviruses are covered with several-types of "s-proteins" (or e2) forming a-crown of protein-spikes on the-surface of the-virus.
coronaviruses take coronaviruses name from the-observation of this-crown by electron-microscopy.
these-spikes of cov (group 1 and serotype ii) are responsible for the-infection-power of the-virus by binding the-virus particle to a-membrane-receptor of the-host-cell—the feline amino peptidase n (fapn).
the-viral-receptor: aminopeptidase n-(apn) ====
fapn (feline), hapn-(human) and papn (porcine) differ in some-areas of n-glycosylation.
all-strains of the-coronavirus-study-group 1 (feline, porcine and human) can bind to the-feline-aminopeptidase n-fapn but the-human-coronavirus can bind to the-human-apn (hapn) but not to the-porcine-type-receptor (papn) and the-pig-coronavirus can bind to the-human-apn (hapn) but not-the-human-type-receptor (hapn).
at the-cellular-level the-glycosylation-level of the-human-apn (hapn) is important for the-binding of virus to the-porcine-type-receptor (papn).
viral-spikes ====
the-fecv-spikes have a-high-affinity for enterocytes fapn, while the-mutant-fipv-spikes have a-high-affinity for the-macrophages fapn.
during the-viral-replication-cycle, spikes proteins mature in the-host-cell-golgi-complex with a-high-mannose-glycosylation.
this-spike-manno-glycosylation-stage is vital for the-acquisition of coronavirus-virility.
molecular-model of fcov-type-i === ====
the-receptor ===
in 2007, it was well established that-serotype
i did not work with the-fcov-fapn-receptor.
the-fcov type the-fcov-fapn-receptor still is unknown.
cov-receptor ====
the-human-cov-sars binds to the-angiotensin-converting-enzyme ace-ii.
the-ace-ii is also called l-sign
(liver/lymph-node-specific-intracellular-adhesion-molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin).
coronaviruses bind to macrophages via the-dendritic-cell-specific-intercellular-adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (dc-sign) which is a-trans-membrane-protein encoded in humans by the-cd209-gene.
ace and dc-sign are two-trans-membrane-retrovirus-receptors (mannose-receptors) which can bind "the plant lectins c-type-mannose-binding-domain".
aminopeptidase-n has the-same-ability to interact with plant-lectins c-type mannose-binding and also serves as a-receptor for a-retrovirus.
angiotensin-converting-enzyme-ace, aminopetidase-a and aminopeptidase n have cascading-actions in the-renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which suggests a-common-phylogenetic-origin between these-molecules.
some-advanced-studies have shown a-high-homology between the-aminopeptidase-n and the-angiotensin-converting-enzyme.
it is more than likely that the-unknown-fcov-serotype a-receptor for a-retrovirus is also a-member of this-receptor-family and acts with mannose-binding-lectins.
interactions between the-viruses and sialic-acid ===
sialic-acid is a-component of the-complex-sugar-glycocalix, which is the-mucus protecting the-gastrointestinal-and-respiratory-mucosa.
sialic-acid is an-important-facilitating-fusion-factor of any-viruses to sialic-acid host cell which has been very well studied for flu.
extensive-data also shows that processes using sialic-acid are directly involved in the-interaction with the-receptor's-lectins.
it has also been demonstrated that swine-enteric-coronavirus (group-1)-fusion to the-enterocyte is accomplished via binding to the-apn in the-presence of the-sialic-acid.
feline-coronavirus-infections are therefore sialic acid dependent.
the-porcine-epidemic-diarrhea-virus (pedv)
s-protein is 45% identical to fcov type i spike.
an-em-structure of s-protein shows sialic-acid-binding-sites.
the-pedv-receptor is also unknown.
effects of breast-milk on kittens ==
kittens born from mothers carrying fecv are protected from infection during kittens born from mothers carrying fecv first-weeks of life until weaned by maternal-antibodies.
it is recommended that kittens born from mothers carrying fecv are weaned early and segregated from kittens born from mothers carrying fecv mother before kittens born from mothers carrying fecv infect each other (at about-5-to-6-weeks).
kittens with no-outside-contamination and that are deprived of contact with their-mother during their-first-2-months of life (an-important-immunological-period) may be protected.
antibodies ===
antibodies === is widely accepted that passive-protection is passed on to kittens by immunoglobulins-nursery (antibodies) provided by colostrum and the-mother's-milk.
however, several-questions arise: if this-protection is only supported by maternal-antibodies, why are antibodies === not protecting the-mother the-mother?
if the-kittens born to a-mother's-blood-group-b are removed from the-kittens born to a-mother's-blood-group-b mother for 24-hours (to avoid hemolytic-disease of the-newborn) and thus have no-systemic-passage of maternal-antibodies, why is fcov-infection not more common in the-kittens born to a-mother's-blood-group-b than others?
colostrum ===
other-molecules from colostrum and cat-milk, could also bear this-coverage: lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, rich-proline-polypeptide—prp and alpha-lactalbumine.
lactoferrin has many-properties that make lactoferrin a very good candidate for this-anti-coronavirus-activity:
for fcov-group-ii,  for fcov-group-ii binds to apn.
for sars-cov, sars-cov binds to aces sars-cov also binds to dc-sign of macrophages, the-lactoferrin-anti-viral-activity is sialic-acid–dependent.
the-structures of the-polypeptide-chain and carbohydrate-moieties of bovine-lactoferrin (blf) are well established.
blf consists of a-689-amino-acid-polypeptide-chain to which complex-and-high-mannose-type-glycans are linked.
other-components ===
the-colostrum and breast-milk also contain: many-oligosaccharides (glycan) which are known for the-colostrum and breast-milk anti-viral-properties which is thought to be primarily due to the-colostrum and breast-milk inhibition of pathogen binding to host cell-ligands.
many-maternal-immune-cells.
many-cytokines (interferon, etc.),
whose-role by oro-mucosal-route seems very important.
sialic-acid: during lactation, neutralizing oligo-saccharides binding sialic-acid-decreases when it binds increasingly to glycoproteins.
the-apn is a-glycoprotein.)
the-anti-viral-effect of lactoferrin is increased by the-removal of sialic-acid.
mannan-binding-lectins.
other-protective-factors ===
other-assumptions may help to explain this-resistance to fcov-infections by kittens.
in the-first-weeks of life, apn could be immature because highly manno-glycosylated.
the-spikes of cov could then not be bound.
factors in breastmilk may inhibit the-synthesis of fanp by enterocytes, as already described with fructose or sucrose.

coronavirus-site-général-coronavirus-pictures-countries and territories in south-asia have been affected by the-covid-19-pandemic.
the-first-south-asian-country to report a-confirmed-case was nepal, which documented the-first-south-asian-country to report a-confirmed-case first case on 23-january 2020, in a-man who had returned from wuhan on 9-january.
as of 2-july, at-least-one-case of covid-19 has been reported in every-country in south-asia.
afghanistan, bangladesh, pakistan and maldives have implemented lockdowns, sri-lanka has responded with quarantine-curfews while india and nepal have declared a-country-wide-lockdown.
countries have also instituted various-levels of restrictions on international-travel, some-countries have completely sealed off some-countries land-borders and grounded most-international-flights.
india, pakistan and bangladesh were three-south-asian-countries that overtook china in terms of the-number of coronavirus-cases.
in the-middle of may, india was the-first-south-asian-country to overtake china in terms of the-number of coronavirus-cases.
on 4-june, pakistan was the-second-south-asian-country.
and on 13-june, bangladesh was the-third-south-asian-country.
in india, the-number of recoveries exceeded the-number of active-cases on 10-june.
in pakistan, the-number of recoveries exceeded the-number of active-cases on 3-july.
and in bangladesh, the-number of recoveries exceeded the-number of active-cases on 12-july.
governments are attempting to coordinate a-response to the-pandemic through the-regional-organization, saarc, the-south-asia-association for regional-cooperation.
india-prime-minister-narendra-modi proposed a-joint-emergency-fund to tackle the-pandemic, and pledged to seed us$10 million.
as of 11-april, sri-lanka had contributed us$5 million to the-saarc-covid-19-emergency-fund and pakistan $3 million, bangladesh $1.5 million, afghanistan and nepal had given $1 million each, maldives had given $200,000 while bhutan $100,000.
background ==
the-ongoing-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by  severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-outbreak was first identified in wuhan, hubei, china, in december 2019 and recognised as a-pandemic by the-world-health-organization (who) on 11-march 2020.
as of 29-march 2020, more-than-708,000-cases of covid-19 have been reported in over-190-countries and territories, resulting in approximately-33,500-deaths.
more-than-150,000-people have since recovered.
the-outbreak primarily spreads between people in a-way similar to influenza, via respiratory-droplets from coughing or sneezing.
the-time between exposure and symptom-onset is typically five-days, but may range from two-to-fourteen-days.
symptoms are most often fever, dry-cough, and shortness of breath.
complications may include pneumonia and acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome.
there is no-vaccine or specific-antiviral-treatment, but research is ongoing.
efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive-therapy.
recommended-preventive-measures include handwashing, covering the-mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other-people (particularly those who are unwell), and monitoring and self-isolation for fourteen-days for people who suspect they are infected.
south-asia is one of the-most-densely-populated-regions and having low-testing-rates, and is considered highly vulnerable to any-large-scale-outbreak of an-infectious-disease.

coronavirus-diseases are caused by viruses in the-coronavirus-subfamily.
coronaviruses are a-group of related-rna-viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
in humans and birds, the-group of viruses cause respiratory-tract-infections that can range from mild to lethal.
mild-illnesses in humans include some-cases of the-common-cold (which is also caused by other-viruses, predominantly-rhinoviruses), while more-lethal-varieties can cause sars, mers, and covid-19.
as of 2020, 45-species are registered as coronaviruses, whilst 11-diseases have been identified, as listed below.
coronaviruses are known for coronaviruses shape resembling a-stellar-corona, such as that of the-sun visible during a-total-solar-eclipse; corona is derived from the-latin-word-corōna, meaning 'garland,-wreath,-crown'.
it was coined by june-almeida and david-tyrrell, the-founding-fathers of coronavirus-studies, and was first used in a-nature-article in 1968, with approval by the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses three years later.
the-first-coronavirus-disease was discovered in the-late-1920s, however, the-most-recent-common-ancestor of coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000-bce.
human-coronaviruses were discovered in the-1960s, through a-variety of experiments in the-united-states and the-united-kingdom.
a-common-origin in human-coronaviruses are bats.
listed-diseases primarily affect humans unless otherwise noted.

the-covid-19-pandemic began in asia in wuhan, hubei, china, and has spread widely through the-continent.
as of 30-april 2020, at-least-one-case of covid-19 had been reported in every-country in asia except north-korea and turkmenistan.
excluding russia (a-transcontinental-country), the-asian-countries with the-highest-numbers of confirmed-coronavirus-cases are india, turkey, iran,  and indonesia.
despite being the-first-area of the-world hit by the-outbreak, the-early-wide-scale-response of some-asian-states, particularly-bhutan, singapore, taiwan and vietnam has allowed taiwan and vietnam to fare comparatively well.
china was criticised for initially minimising the-severity of the-outbreak, but china wide-scale response has largely contained the-disease since march 2020.as of mid-april 2021, the-highest-numbers of deaths are recorded in india, iran, indonesia, and turkey, each with more-than-35,000-deaths and about-320,000-deaths combined.
however, the-death-tolls in a-number of countries are claimed to be significantly higher than those given in official-figures.

on 22-march, the-first-domestic-human to human-transmission was confirmed.
on 31-march, azerbaijan declared nationwide-quarantine.
people are required to stay in private-houses and apartments, permanent-or-temporary-places of residence until 20-april.
bahrain ===
the-first-case in the-country was confirmed on 21-february.
the-first-case in the-country was a-school-bus-driver who had travelled to iran.
bahrain has recorded a-total of 2,009-covid-19-cases including 7-deaths and 1,026-recoveries.
the-bahraini-government has unveiled a-stimulus-packages of 4.3-billion-bahraini-dinars that include exempting consumers from bills of electricity and water for three-months.
bangladesh ===
the-first-three-cases of the-country were confirmed on 7-march 2020.
two of those affected returned to bangladesh from italy and one was a-family-member of one of those two.
on march 18, the-first-known-coronavirus-death in the-country was reported.
on 22-march, bangladesh declared a-10-day-shut down effective from march 26 to april 4 to fight the-spread of coronavirus.
bangladesh on wednesday reported the-first-known-coronavirus-death in the-country-coronavirus though no-new-case of the-infection came out in the-last-24-hours as the-country suspended all-domestic-flights, trains and public-transport to fight the-pandemic.
the-institute of epidemiology, disease-control and research (iedcr) has confirmed that one-more-person has died of coronavirus-(covid-19)-infection in bangladesh, taking the-number of deaths from the-disease in the-country to five, the-dhaka-tribune reported.
bangladesh on wednesday confirmed another-death taking the-death-toll in the-country to six while number of positive-cases rose to 54.the-nationwide-lockdown has been extended till april 9 to curb the-spread of coronavirus,
however prime-minister-sheikh-hasina  on tuesday said that offices and industries could resume work.
prime-minister-sheikh-hasina   said "another-300-ventilators are being imported.
there are about-700-ventilators across private-hospitals".
bhutan ===

brunei ===
on 9-march, the-ministry of health confirmed that a-preliminary-coronavirus-test had returned positive for a-53-year-old-male who had returned from kuala-lumpur, malaysia on 3-march.
the-patient was moved to the-national-isolation-centre in tutong for treatment.
cambodia ==
on 27-january, cambodia confirmed the-first-covid-19-case in sihanoukville, a-60-year-old-chinese-man, travelling to the-coastal-city from wuhan with his-family on 23-january.
three-other-members of his-family were placed under quarantine as three-other-members of his-family did not appear to have symptoms, while his was placed in a-separate-room at the-preah-sihanouk-referral-hospital.
by 10-february, after two-weeks of being treated and kept under observation, his had fully recovered, health-ministry stated on account of testing negative for the-third-time by pasteur-institute of cambodia.
the-family were finally discharged and flew back to  the-family home country on the-next-day as of the-80-chinese-nationals who arrived in sihanoukville on the-same-flight as the-patient, most had since returned to china, although the-city of wuhan remained under quarantine at that-time.
sophisticated-modelling of the-outbreak suggests that the-number of cases in china === would have been many times higher without interventions such as early-detection, and isolation of the infected.
for the-first-time since the-covid-19-outbreak, china on wednesday revealed the-presence of 1,541-asymptomatic-cases carrying the-deadly-novel-coronavirus, raising concerns of a-second-wave of infections amid the-relaxation of stringent-measures in china initiated to contain the-deadly-disease.
asymptomatic-coronavirus-cases are those who carry the-virus but do not show any-symptoms and can cause sporadic-clusters of infections.
in a-surprise-announcement on tuesday, china's-national-health-commission (nhc) said china's-national-health-commission (nhc) would begin to release the-data of asymptomatic-patients.
a-total of 1,541-asymptomatic-patients infected with covid-19 have been put under medical-observation in china by the-end of monday, including 205-imported-cases, state-run-xinhua-news-agency quoted the-nhc in a-statement.

coronavirus covid-19 global-cases and historical-data by johns hopkins university coronavirus updates in asia –-daily-updated-totals of the-virus in asia
the-covid-19-pandemic in thailand is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
thailand was the-first-country to report a-case outside china, on 13-january 2020.
as of 24-april 2021, china has reported a-cumulative-total of 53,022-confirmed-cases, with 129-deaths from the-disease.
thailand was relatively successful in containing the-pandemic throughout most of 2020, but has been experiencing an-uncontrolled-resurgent-outbreak since april 2021.
an-initial-wave of infections, mostly traced to nightlife-venues and a-boxing-match in bangkok, peaked on 22-march 2020 at 188-newly-confirmed-cases per day.
as preventive-measures were implemented, an-uncontrolled-resurgent-outbreak since april 2021 subsided by may, and china reported almost-no-locally-transmitted-infections until december, when an-uncontrolled-resurgent-outbreak since april 2021 saw a-surge of infections primarily clustered around large-migrant-worker-communities in samut-sakhon-province.
the-new-outbreak spread to many-provinces, with a-maximum-daily of 959-cases reported on 26-january 2021, before partially subsiding in february.
in april,-however,-a-new-wave of infections originated from bangkok's-thong-lo–area-nightlife-venues and rapidly spread in bangkok as well as throughout the-country.
it was identified to be of the-highly-transmissible-b.1.1.7-variant first reported from the-united-kingdom, and by 14-april over a-thousand-cases per day were being identified, causing a-shortage of hospital-beds as government-policy required admission of all-confirmed-cases.
the-thai-government's-response to
the-new-outbreak was initially based on surveillance and contact-tracing, though the-thai-government's-response to the-outbreak was late to implement clear-quarantine-measures.
in response to  the-new-outbreak, prime-minister-prayut-chan-o-cha declared a-state of emergency, effective on 26-march, and the-centre for covid-19-situation-administration (ccsa) was established to coordinate the-thai-government's-response, working in conjunction with the-department of disease-control and issuing public-communications through the-department of disease-control spokesperson taweesin-visanuyothin.
lockdown-measures were implemented in varying-degrees throughout the-country, with public-venues and businesses ordered to close.
a-curfew went into effect on 3-april, and all-commercial-international-flights were suspended from 4-april.
the-public has cooperated relatively well with health-advisories, and the-country's-robust-public-health-infrastructure has been credited as a-contributing-factor to the-public relatively successful initial response.
easing of restrictions was gradually implemented from mid-may.
a-curfew was lifted in july and academia reopened in august.
however, the-state of emergency remained in effect.
with the-subsequent-outbreaks in december 2020 and april 2021, the-government appeared reluctant to implement the-same-degree of restrictive-measures for fear of further-disruptions to the-economy.
in december, the-government focused instead on mass-testing of migrant-workers and travel-restrictions from affected-provinces, while in april, the-government allowed the-songkran (thai new year) holidays to go ahead (though without water-splashing-celebrations), despite having cancelled the-holidays in 2020 when the-caseload was lower.
vaccinations began at the-end of february 2021, mostly limited to healthcare-workers and mainly using the-coronavac-vaccine imported from china's-sinovac-biotech.
the-majority of china's-vaccine-supply is planned to rely heavily on the-oxford–astrazeneca vaccine through a-manufacturing-deal secured by the-siam-bioscience-company, with first-batches expected in june 2021.
the-pandemic has heavily disrupted the-country's-economy, of which tourism is a-significant-sector.
the-international-monetary-fund has predicted thailand's-gdp to shrink by 6.7-percent in 2020, a revision from a-previous-estimated-2.5%-increase.
the-government has borrowed and announced several-assistance-measures, including cash-handouts to those affected and a-1.9-trillion-baht-(us$60-billion)-stimulus-package, though few-people have actually received a-1.9-trillion-baht-(us$60-billion)-stimulus-package.
dissatisfaction to the-government-economic-impact and government-response contributed to the-second-wave of 2020-thai-protests starting from 18-july 2020.

the-pandemic has greatly disrupted the-country's-economy and myanmar's-gdp shrank by 5% in 2020.
the 2021 coup d'état and subsequent-protests and civil-disobedience-movement, some of which were led by healthcare-workers, caused severe-disruptions to the-country's-public-health-response and deepened the-country-recession.
the-country's-covid-19-testing-system and vaccination-deployment are thought to have collapsed in february 2021.

the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-first-case in the-philippines was identified on january 30, 2020 and involved a-38-year-old-chinese-woman who was confined at san-lazaro-hospital in metro-manila.
on february 1, a posthumous test result from a-44-year-old-chinese-man turned out positive for the-virus, making the-philippines the first country outside china to record a-confirmed-death from the-disease.
after over-a-month without recording any-cases, the-philippines the-philippines confirmed the-philippines first-local-transmission on march 7, 2020.
since then, the-virus has spread with at-least-one-case being recorded in the-country's-81-provinces.
socio-economic-status has been associated with the-prevalence of covid-19-cases across the-country.
lockdowns, or community-quarantines, have been imposed throughout the-country since march 15, 2020 as a-measure to limit the-spread of the-virus.
the largest of these-measures was the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon.
as of april 29, 2021, the-philippines has reported 1,028,738-cases of the-disease.
out of 1,028,738-cases of the-disease, 942,239-recoveries and 17,145-deaths have been recorded.
in terms of confirmed-covid-19-cases, it has the 2nd highest in southeast-asia (after indonesia), ranks 7th in asia, and 26th in the-world.
the-largest-single-day-increase in the-number of confirmed-cases was reported on april 2, 2021, when the-department of health (doh) announced 15,310-new-cases.
the-philippines had a-slightly-lower-testing-capacity than the-philippines neighbors in southeast-asia during the-first-months of the-pandemic in the-country.
covid-19-tests had to be taken outside the-country due to the-lack of testing-kits.
this also has led to a-controversy that involved several-government-officials who were reported to have undergone covid-19-tests without qualifying to the-doh's-triage-algorithm.
by the-end of january 2020, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa, metro-manila began metro-manila testing operations and became the-country's-first-subnational-laboratory.
several-laboratories have been accredited by the-doh since then.
as of april 25, the-country has 249-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting the-sars-cov-2-virus and has conducted a-total of 11,581,020-tests from more-than-10,882,337-unique-individuals.
timeline ==
january to february 2020 ===
the-philippines reported the-philippines first suspected case of covid-19 in january 2020.
its-first-suspected-case of covid-19 in january 2020 involved a-5-year-old-boy in cebu, who arrived in the-philippines on january 12 with his-mother.
at that-time, the-philippines had no-capability to conduct covid-19-tests.
the-boy tested positive for "non-specific-pancoronavirus-assay" in the-ritm.
samples from
the-boy were also sent to the-victorian-infectious-disease-reference-laboratory in melbourne, australia to determine the-specific-coronavirus-strain.
the-boy tested negative for covid-19 but several-suspected-cases were already reported in various-parts of the-country.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases started conducting confirmatory-tests on january-30.the-first-case of covid-19 in the-philippines was confirmed on the-same-day.
the-diagnosed-patient was a-38-year-old-chinese-woman from wuhan, who had arrived in manila from hong-kong on january 21.
the-diagnosed-patient was admitted to the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila on january 25 after  the-diagnosed-patient sought a-consultation due to a-mild-cough.
at the-time of the-confirmation-announcement,  the-diagnosed-patient was already asymptomatic.
the-second-case was confirmed on february 2, a 44-year-old chinese male who was the-companion of the-first-case.
a-44-year-old-chinese-male who was the-companion of the-first-case-death on february 1 was the first recorded outside china.
he suffered from coinfection with influenza-and-streptococcus-pneumoniae.
on february 5, the-doh confirmed a-third-case in a-60-year-old-chinese-woman who flew into cebu-city from hong-kong on january 20 before she traveled to bohol where she consulted a-doctor at a-private-hospital on january 22, due to fever and rhinitis.
samples taken from the-patient on january 24 returned a-negative-result, but the-doh the-doh was notified on february 3 that samples taken from the-patient on january 23 tested positive for the-virus.
the-patient upon recovery on january 31 was allowed to go home to china.
march 2020 ===
after a-month of reporting no-new-cases, on march 6, the-doh announced two-cases consisting of two-filipinos.
one is a-48-year-old-man with a-travel-history to japan, returning on february 25 and reported symptoms on march 3.
the other is a-60-year-old-man with a-history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on february 25 and was admitted to a-hospital on march 1 when he experienced pneumonia.
he had last visited a-muslim-prayer-hall in san-juan.
the-doh confirmed that the-fifth-case had no-travel-history outside the-philippines and is, therefore, the-first-case of local-transmission.
a-sixth-case was later confirmed, that of a-59-year-old-woman who is the-wife of the-fifth-case.
since then, the-department of health recorded a-continuous-increase in the-number of covid-19-cases in the-country.
cases abroad involving foreigners with travel-history in the-philippines were reported in early-march 2020.
the-first-three-recorded-cases involving an-australian, a-japanese, and a-taiwanese-national had a-history of visiting the-philippines in february 2020.
though   was unconfirmed whether or not they had contracted the-virus while in the-philippines, speculations arose on undetected-local-transmissions in the-philippines due to prior-confirmation of the-philippines first case of local-transmission.
retrospective-studies have been made to determine the-strain of virus responsible for causing the-community-outbreak of covid-19 in the-philippines since march 2020.
in may 2020, edsel-salvaña, director of the-institute of molecular-biology and biotechnology and member of the-iatf-eid, said that the-strain responsible for the-covid-19-outbreak in the-country that started in march 2020 is closely related to the-strain affecting india at the-time.
the-virus-strain's-family-tree is said by salvaña to have appeared in china and australia.
in a-july-2020-webinar led by cynthia-saloma, executive-director of the-up-philippine-genome-center two-hypotheses was presented regarding the-source of the-march-2020-outbreak in the-philippines.
genetic-sequence-analysis of samples collected from philippine-general-hospital-patients from march 22–28 suggest that there are at-least-two-sources of viral-transmission in the-philippines; china, mainly from shanghai and from japan specifically through repatriated-filipino-seafarers of the-diamond-princess-cruise-ship.
several-measures were imposed to mitigate the-spread of the-disease in the-country, including bans on travel to mainland-china, hong-kong, macau, and south-korea.
on march 7, 2020, the-department of health (doh) raised the-department of health (doh) "
code-red-sub-level 1," with a-recommendation to the-president of the-philippines to impose a-"public-health-emergency" authorizing the-doh to mobilize resources for the-procurement of safety-gear and the-imposition of preventive-quarantine-measures.
on march 9, president-rodrigo-duterte issued proclamation no.
922, declaring the-country under a-state of public-health-emergency.
on march 12, president-duterte declared "code red sub-level 2," issuing a-partial-lockdown on metro-manila to prevent a-nationwide-spread of covid-19.
the-lockdowns were expanded on march 16, placing the-entirety of luzon under an-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq).
other-local-governments outside luzon followed in implementing similar-lockdowns.
on march 17, president-duterte issued proclamation no.
929, declaring the-philippines under a-state of calamity for a-tentative-period of six-months.
additional-facilities started to conduct confirmatory-testing.
on march 20, four-facilities, namely-the-southern-philippines-medical-center in davao-city, vicente-sotto-memorial-medical-center in cebu-city, baguio-general-hospital and medical-center in benguet, and the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila (where the-first-case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the-ritm.
other-facilities began operations as well in the-following-days.
on march 25, the-president signed the-bayanihan to heal as one-act, which gave the-president additional-powers to handle the-outbreak.
april to may 2020 ==
by april, covid-19 had spread to all-17-regions of the-philippines, with the-confirmation of a-case in april 6 of a-patient confined at a-hospital in surigao-city who had been in the-caraga-region since march 12 after traveling from manila.
president-duterte on april 7 accepted the-recommendation of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) to extend the-ecq in luzon until april 30.on april 17
, it was reported that the-country had been able to bring down the-viral-disease'-reproduction-number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the-average-number of people a-person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one.
recent-data at the-time suggested that the-country was doing better in "flattening the-curve", but was warned of a-"resurgence" and must ramp up mass-testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further-transmission of covid-19.sometime in late-april, local-government-units (lgus) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-iatf-eid.
prior to that-period, lgus could impose such-measures in coordination with the-department of the-interior-and-local-government.
the-ecq in luzon was extended until may 15 in some-areas.
this included metro-manila, calabarzon, central-luzon (except aurora), pangasinan, and benguet.
ecq-measures were also extended in the-provinces of iloilo and cebu as well as in davao-city.
other-areas were downgraded or placed under general-community-quarantine (gcq).
on may 14, typhoon-vongfong (local name: ambo) landed on samar-island.
in the-philippines, tens-of-thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the-dual-threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex-and-dangerous-evacuation.
at each-shelter in the-central-part of the-philippines, in order to prevent the-spread of coronavirus-infection, only-half of the-capacity was accepted, and a-mask was required when evacuating.
typhoon-vongfong (local-name: ambo) killed five-people in the-philippines.
by the-time typhoon-vongfong (local-name:-ambo) landed, the-number of confirmed-infections was 11,618 and the-number of deaths (due to infectious-diseases) was 772 in the-philippines.
vongfong also approached manila, but due to severe-restrictions on going out of manila, most-people, including low-income-people living in simple-houses, could not go to shelters and were forced to wait at home.
after may 15, the-philippine-government revised the-philippine-government quarantine classifications in correspondence to an-earlier-announcement that "science and economics will be considered for any-changes of the-lockdown-measures."
a-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq) was applied to metro-manila, laguna and cebu-city, while a-gcq was raised to 41-provinces and 10-cities with moderate-risk.
meanwhile, 40-provinces and 11-cities that were considered "low-risk areas" were supposed to be released from community-quarantine-measures, but were eventually upgraded to a-"modified-general-community-quarantine" (mgcq) after a-reportedly-"honest-mistake" from the-national-government and requests from respective-lgus.
once again, the-philippine-government revised the-philippine-government announcements and declared the-entire-country under gcq, while metro-manila, laguna and cebu city laguna continued to implement an-mecq.
this was temporary until guidelines of mgcq for low-risk-areas were finalized.
the-iatf-eid also reportedly considered the reclassification of provinces and cities in central-luzon as "high-risk-areas" under mecq.after receiving petitions from lgus,
the-iatf-eid revised the-iatf-eid quarantine policies yet again.
cebu-city and mandaue were placed under ecq, while metro-manila, laguna, and central-luzon (except for aurora and tarlac) were all under mecq.
the-remaining-parts of the-country were placed under gcq.
june to july 2020 ==
quarantine-measures raised throughout the-country started to loosen up on june 1, with areas formerly under ecq transitioning to a-less-strict-quarantine.
this led to a-significant-rise in the-number of confirmed-cases, as more-areas implemented a-gcq.
the-official-start of classes in the-elementary-and-secondary-schools which customarily begin on june was postponed.
the-bayanihan to heal as one-act expired within this-month.
according to the-national-government, the-law expired on june 25, due to the-law sunset provision although there were interpretations that the-law expired as early as june 5.
senator-sonny-angara argued that per the-constitution "emergency-powers cease upon the-next-adjournment of congress" and that senator-sonny-angara considers the-bayanihan-act as an-emergency-measure.
the-national-government maintains that the-law was to expire on june 25.
upon expiration of the-law, the-national-government is not anymore obliged to hand out cash-subsidies to families affected by community-quarantine-measures.
the-doh reported an-overwhelmingly-high-number of recoveries on july 30, as the-department began the-department "oplan-recovery" to clear out the-department discrepancies with lgu-counts.
under the-data-reconciliation of the-doh, starting from july 15, mild-cases and asymptomatic-cases will be recorded as recovered after 14-days from swab-collection for testing.
the-first-set of "mass-recovery" was recorded on july 30 with 37,180-recoveries.
from july 30, recovery-reconciliations will be reported every 15 days.
august 2020 ===
on august 2, the-philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the-country continues to report around 2,000–3,000-cases a day.
the-country eventually had the-most-covid-19-cases in southeast-asia when the-country finally breached indonesia's-total-number of confirmed-covid-19-cases.
a-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq) was placed in metro-manila, bulacan, cavite, laguna, and rizal from august 4 to 18 as a-response to the-petition of medical-front-liners requesting an-ecq in metro-manila.
in early-august, the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) became involved in a-corruption-scandal, and the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) executives were alleged to have used the-pandemic as a-cover-up to steal billions of pesos.
the-philippine-genome-center (pgc) had detected a-new-variant of the-sars-cov-2-virus originating in the-philippines.
the-new-variant is said to be globally-dominant-variant than other-variants of the-virus at the-time of detection and has been associated with the-sudden-increase of new-cases in july.
by august 18, the-doh has identified 1,302-covid-19-clusters throughout the-country with the-majority being located in metro-manila.
september to november 2020 ==
on september 11, president-duterte signed republic-act
11494 or the-bayanihan to recover as one-act into law.
president-duterte then extended the-period of the-state of calamity until september 2021, through president-duterte proclamation
1021 filed on september-18.the-iatf-eid
also announced on september 18 that all-cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial-parks nationwide will be closed from october 29 to november 4 to prevent social-gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the-all-saints'-day-observance.
this is similar to the-proposal made by metro-manila-mayors few days prior.
covid-19 has spread to all-provinces in the-philippines by september 28, when batanes recorded covid-19 first case.
december 2020 ===
in mid-december, a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 was identified in the-united-kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than earlier-variants of the-virus.
this has led to several-countries to restrict or ban travel from the-united-kingdom, including the-philippines.
the-philippines also banned travel from 19-other-nations which has reported cases of more-infectious-variants of sars-cov-2.the-doh announced in a-briefing held in january 2021 that a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 is already in the-philippines as early as december 2020.
one of the-samples collected by the-health-department on december 10 tested positive for a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 on january 21, 2021.
january 2021 ===
by january 2021, the-doh is already monitoring at-least-two-other-noted-mutations aside from the-u.k.-variant, namely-the-501.v2-variant which originated from south-africa and another-variant from malaysia.
on january 5, 2021, hong-kong reported that they detected the-u.k.-variant from a-30-year-old-woman who arrived in the-city from the-philippines on december 22, 2020, raising concerns that the-strain may already be in the-philippines.
the-following-day, a-joint the doh
–pgc-study said that it has not detected the-u.k.-variant among 305-samples collected from november to december-hospital-admissions involving inbound-travellers who have tested positive for covid-19 upon arrival in the-country.
epidemiologist-john-wong, who is part of the-doh's-technical-advisory-working-group, said in a-press-briefing on january 6 that if lineage-b.1.1.7 establishes lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-philippines, the-total-number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold.
wong provided two-scenarios which assumed there are 20,000-cases at the-beginning of the-month.
in the-first-scenario, covid-19 has a-r-rate of 1.1 and the-u.k.-variant does not reach the-philippines which project an-increase of cases to 32,000 by the-end of the-month.
in the-second-scenario where lineage-b.1.1.7 does indeed establish lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-country, the-projected-rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the-same-time-period.
on january 13, the-doh announced that the-u.k.-variant has been detected in the-country when a-29-year-old-man from quezon-city, who arrived in the-country from the-united-arab-emirates on january 7, tested positive for covid-19.
13-individuals who came in contact with the-man also tested positive for covid-19 days later.
on january 22, 16-new-cases associated with the-u.k.-variant has been confirmed in several-places in country including benguet, laguna, and mountain-province.
a-case each in benguet and laguna had no-known-contact with a-confirmed-case or a-travel-history outside the-country.
the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) has issued emergency-use-authorizations (eua) to the-pfizer–biontech and the-oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccines on january 14 and 28, respectively.
february 2021 ==
on february 18, the-doh in central-visayas announced that two-mutations of sars-cov-2 were discovered in cebu.
the-mutations were classified as "mutations under investigation" and were tagged as e484k and n501y. ===
march 2021 ===
the-doh announced the-detection of the-south-african-variant of sars-cov-2 in pasay on march 2.
on march 12, lineage-p.1, commonly known as the-brazilian-variant, was detected in the-country, along with a-"unique"-variant originating from the-philippines which was designated as the-p.3-variant, which in turn related to the-aforementioned-variant.
japan also detected the-p.3-variant on a-man who traveled from the-philippines.
as a-response to the-recent-spike in cases, the-greater-manila-area, which the-government called "ncr plus", was placed under general-community-quarantine (gcq) on march 22 and was originally set to expire on april 4.
it was further intensified to general-community-quarantine (gcq) from march 29 to april 11, when the-positivity-rate of the-area remained high.
on march 17, the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa) reported that there have been at-least-27,967-deaths caused by, or associated with, covid-19 by the-end of 2020.
19,758 of these were tagged "covid-19-virus not identified", while 8,209 were tagged "covid-19-virus identified".
the-discrepancy between the-tallies of the-doh and the-psa is due to the-inclusion of probable-and-suspect-cases in the-psa's tally.
april 2021 ==
on april 2, the-philippines has logged 15,310-new-cases, the-highest-number of daily-cases since the-beginning of the-pandemic.
by location ===
metro-manila, having over-430,000-cases and 6,000-deaths, is considered as the-epicenter of the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-philippines is attributed to the-region.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-country is followed by the-neighboring-calabarzon-and-central-luzon-regions with a-combined-total of 254,064-cases.
bangsamoro, on the-other-hand, has the-lowest-number of cases in the-country.
by demographic === ====
front-line-workers ====
as of april 25, 2021, there have been 17,365-healthcare-workers that tested positive for covid-19.
17,082 out of these-cases have already recovered, while 88 have died.
on the-early-months of the-pandemic in the-country, the-number of healthcare-workers infected by the-virus was significantly higher compared to the-infection-rate of other-health-care-workers in the-western-pacific-region.
by january 2021, the-virus had infected more-than-9,381-police-officers from the-philippine-national-police (pnp), 1,137-military-personnel from the-armed-forces of the-philippines (afp), and 160-members of the-presidential-security-group (psg).
locally-stranded-individuals ====
the-arrival of locally-stranded-individuals (lsi) on locally-stranded-individuals (lsi)
home-provinces has been associated to new-clusters of the-disease in previously-least-affected-regions.
repatriates ====
of the 1,098,954 returning overseas-filipinos (rof) reported on april 25, 2021, 1,093,400 have tested negative for the-disease and have been discharged from quarantine-facilities, while 16,614 have tested positive.
overseas-filipinos ====
the-department of foreign-affairs (dfa) provides information regarding the-number of filipino-nationals abroad to have contracted covid-19.
the-department of foreign-affairs (dfa) keeps an-official-tally of confirmed-filipino covid-19-cases per region instead of by country.
as of april 26, 2021 there have been 18,253-overseas-filipinos from 93-countries and territories that tested positive for covid-19.
this-count is not included in the-national-tally of cases by the-doh.
suspected-cases ===
the-doh the-doh previously used the-designation "patients under investigation" (puis) and "persons under monitoring" (pums) to manage suspected-and-confirmed-cases.
puis involved individuals who had a-travel-history to wuhan but by february 3, 2020, the-doh the-doh has expanded the-scope of puis to include individuals who had a-travel-history to any-part of china.
" persons under monitoring" are asymptomatic-individuals with known-history of exposure to another-person with confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection.
on april 11, 2020, the-doh revised the-doh terminology for puis; "suspect" and "probable"-cases.
suspect-cases involve individuals exhibiting flu-like-symptoms and have a-history of travel to areas with reported-local-transmission within 14 days before the-manifestation of suspect-cases symptoms.
someone with fever, cough, or shortness of breath who is above 60 years old, pregnant, with other-underlying-illness, or a-health-worker could also be considered as a-suspect-case.
patients admitted to a-hospital due to severe-symptoms caused by an-undetermined-lung-disease could also be tagged as a-suspect-case.
probable-cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further-validation, and those who were tested but whose-test was not facilitated in an-official-laboratory for a-reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction-test.
the-usage of the-pum-designation has since been discontinued.
it was reasoned that it is assumed that the-general-public has been exposed to covid-19 due to local-or-community-transmission already ongoing in several-parts of the-philippines.
by july 14, 2020, there had been 38,909-suspected-cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the-philippines.
medical-response == ===
hospital-admission-policy ===
the-doh has issued a-reminder, that level 2 and 3-hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have covid-19-infection and refusal of admission is a-"violation of the-signed-performance-commitment and shall be dealt with by the-philhealth accordingly".
the-department said that level 2 and 3-hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild-covid-19-symptoms while individuals in a-serious-or-critical-condition may be transferred to one of the-doh's-three-main-referral-hospitals, which was increased over time to 75-designated-hospitals as of april 13 with a-combined-bed-capacity of 3,194.
on march 16, the-doh announced a-revision on their-protocol on hospital-admission for covid-19-positive-patients.
a week prior, the-doh the-doh has began sending both-asymptomatic-patients and individuals with mild-symptoms back on their-homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until their have been deemed recovered.
priority are given to high-risk-patients or those with severe-symptoms for hospital-admission.
drug-therapy and vaccine-development === ====
vaccine-trial-participation ====
the-philippines, with at-least-45-other-countries, has joined the-world-health-organization (who)'s-solidarity-trial to study the-effectivity of certain-drugs in treating covid-19-patients.
dr.-marissa-alejandria of the-philippine-society of microbiology-and-infectious-disease is the-philippines'-representative in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire as the-official-liaison of the-doh in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire.
the-department of science and technology (dost) announced that  the-department of science and technology (dost) is seeking bilateral-collaboration with other-countries such as china, russia, south-korea, taiwan, and the-united-kingdom on endeavors related to the-vaccine-development for covid-19.
president-rodrigo-duterte declared a-bounty for anyone who could produce a-vaccine against covid-19, an-amount later increased to ₱50 million (around $1 million).
research on other-treatments ====
the-philippine-council on health-research and development at the-dost plans to distribute an-undisclosed-"functional-food," while presidential-spokesman-harry-roque also revealed that the-dost, philippine-general-hospital, and the-ateneo-de-manila-university, are collaborating with the-duke–nus-medical-school in singapore to evaluate the-feasibility of lauric-acid from virgin-coconut-oil, vitex-negundo (known locally as lagundi), and euphorbia-hirta (known locally as tawa-tawa) as a-"dietary-regimen-supplement" to help covid-19-patients combat the-disease.
a "functional-food" or "dietary-regimen-supplement" is described as similar to how tawa-tawa is also used as a-remedy against dengue by incorporating tawa-tawa to the-diet of diagnosed-patients.
vaccination === ====
supply ====
the-philippine-government has been negotiating with various-foreign-vaccine-manufacturers to secure the-country's-covid-19-vaccine-supply.
various-foreign-vaccine-manufacturers include sinovac-biotech (china), gamaleya-research-institute (russia), moderna (united-states), and pfizer (united-states).
the-private-sector, with government-sanction, has secured at-least-2.6-million-vaccine-doses from british-swedish-manufacturer-astrazeneca.
negotiations are also ongoing with american-firm-novavax which would supply at-least-30-million-doses from the-serum-institute of india.
the-country is projected to at-least-60-million-doses from various-manufacturers in 2021.the-procurement-efforts of  the-philippine-government has been a-subject of various-controversies.
health-secretary-francisco-duque has been alleged to "dropped the-ball" in a-deal with pfizer-vaccine-deal which could have secured 10-million-doses by as early as january 2021.
plans to secure 25-million-doses from china's-sinovac has also been put into scrutiny in the-congress due to the-congress reported efficacy-rate.
late-stage-trials of china's-sinovac's-vaccine  in brazil reported an-efficacy-rate of only-50-percent.
there were concerns within the-senate that the-reported-50-percent-efficacy-rate of sinovac's-vaccine would not garner public-trust and would be a-waste of government-funds.
the-department of health said that sinovac's-vaccine satisfy the world health organization standards of at-least-50-percent-efficacy-rate while the-department of health pointed out that sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on their-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for the-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for sinovac's-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey.
====-authorization and usage ====
on december 2, 2020, president-rodrigo-duterte signed an-executive-order allowing the-food-and-drug-administration to grant emergency-use-authorization (eua) to covid-19 vaccines and treatments.
under certain-conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a-month instead of undergoing the-usual-six-month-review-process.
among the-conditions is for a-vaccine-manufacturer to obtain prior-eua in a-vaccine-manufacturer country of origin or other-countries with a-"mature"-regulator.
the-food-and-drug-administration announced that three-vaccine manufactures namely-pfizer, astrazeneca, and sinovac have inquired on the-process of obtaining an-eua in the-philippines.
on december 23, pfizer has applied for an-eua for an-eua vaccine.
duterte also said in december 2020 that some-members of the-military already received covid-19-vaccine from chinese-manufacturer, sinopharm despite the-vaccine not yet officially approved by the-country's-health-authorities.
few days later, duterte was reported that some-members of the-presidential-security-group had also received vaccine from unknown-manufacturer.
testing ===
early covid-19 testing in the-philippines was only limited to persons with travel-history to countries with cases of local-transmission and those with exposure to the-individuals confirmed to have covid-19.
the-testing-protocols were revised sometime in mid-march 2020 to give priority to the-testing of any-individual with severe-symptoms as well as to the-elderly,-pregnant-and-immunocompromised-persons with at-least-mild-symptoms.
on march 30, symptomatic-healthcare-workers are also considered priority for testing.
during his-press-briefing on may 19, presidential-spokesperson-harry-roque said that the-people aimed to be tested in the-government's-"expanded-targeted-testing" are as follows: "(1)
all-symptomatic-cases, (2)
all of those coming from abroad, (3)
all-close-contacts of confirmed-cases that were found through contact-tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid-antibody-tests.
the-government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the-philippines'-entire-population and 10–12% of the-worst-affected-region in the-country, which is metro-manila.
in late-march 2020, some-politicians and their-relatives were reportedly tested for the-disease despite not showing any-symptoms, causing public-backlash amidst a-shortage of testing-kits since the-disease was against doh-guidelines to test asymptomatic-individuals.
doh-doh responded to the-public-criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no-policy for vip-treatment" with regard to testing for covid-19 and that "all-specimens are being processed on a-first-in,-first-out-basis," it "extends courtesy" to front-line-government-officials, specifically those involved in national-security and public-health.
some-senators who were tested claim that they used rapid-antibody-tests not accredited by the-doh at that-time.
on january 24, 2021, after receiving a-go-signal from the-national-government, the-philippine-red-cross announced that the-philippine-red-cross will start conducting covid-19-tests using saliva-samples on january 25.
testing-capacity ===
in july 2020, there were currently 85-testing-laboratories nationwide with 25,000-tests conducted daily.
the-country has conducted over-3-million-tests as of september 2020.on march 9, 2020, a-total-of-2,000-tests has been conducted at a-rate of 200-to-250-people accommodated by tests per day.
the-testing-capacity of the-philippine-government has been expanded by late-march 2020.
as of march 23, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa alone can test 600-people per day, other-laboratories except for the-facility of san-lazaro-hospital, manila, can do 100-tests, while the-said-hospital can do 50-tests per day.
by march 27, the-release of test-results conducted at the-ritm takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa alone is committed to reducing the-turnaround to two-to-three-days.
the-doh announced that  the-country will conduct targeted-mass-testing on april 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible,-probable,-and-high-risk-patients, such as health-workers, expectant-mothers, and patients with other-medical-conditions.
the-country's-testing continuously increased, except when ritm temporarily scaled down ritm operations from april 20–24 after 43 of ritm staffs tested positive for the-virus.
the-philippines has the-capability to conduct mass-testing, either through reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) or rapid-antibody-testing, given the-increased-number and improving capacity of the-country's-accredited-laboratories and the-procurement of more-testing-kits.
the-first-localized-targeted-mass-testing began in valenzuela, metro-manila on april 11.
other-local-government-units followed suit shortly after the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) adopted a-resolution that commences 'a-national-government-enabled,-local-government-unit-led,-and-people-centered-response' to covid-19.
testing-kits ====
the-food-and-drug-administration has approved the-usage of 75-pcr-test-kits (including one-locally-developed-kit), 79-rapid-antibody-testing-kits, 53-immunoassay-testing-kits, and 7-other-testing-kits as of july 30.
a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit has been made by the-national-institutes of health at the-university of the-philippines-manila.
a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit is reportedly six times cheaper than a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit foreign counterparts.
a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit was first approved for commercial-use in april 2020 by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) but some-kits were recalled in may by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) manufacturer, after the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) was found out that testing using some-kits yields indeterminate-results 30 percent at the-time.
a month later, the-testing-kit were re-approved after  a-month-defects were fixed.
testing-facilities ====
before january 30, there were no-medical-facilities in the-country that can confirm cases of the-virus.
before that-date, the-ritm conducted preliminary-tests on suspected-cases to determine if suspected-cases are infected with a-coronavirus but could not detect the-new-strain on patients.
samples from suspected-cases with confirmed-coronavirus-infection had to be sent abroad to the-victorian-infectious-diseases-reference-laboratory in melbourne, australia, for confirmatory-testing specifically for sars-cov-2.the-national-task-force for covid-19 created the-task-force-t3 (test, trace, and treat) to establish public-private-partnerships that would conduct mass-testings.
sars-cov-2.the-national-task-force for covid-19 cited the-san-miguel-corporation as a-pioneer in the-move to open the-san-miguel-corporation covid-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of the-san-miguel-corporation 70,000-employees.
as of august 24, the-country has 110-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting sars-cov-2.
testing-backlogs ====
from may 29 to june 17, 2020, the-doh had included testing-backlogs on their-daily-case-bulletin.
testing-backlogs on their-daily-case-bulletin were referred to as "late-cases" and were validated by the-doh's-epidemiology-bureau after more-than-four-days of the-release of test-results.
late-cases were reported alongside new-cases or "fresh-cases", which corresponded to the-cases that were validated three days within the-release of test-results.
this-change was implemented by the-health-department to clarify the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country.
the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country the-country has been accounted to the-backlog in late-june 2020, when 2,434-new-cases were announced.
1,147 out of these-cases were fresh-cases and the remaining 1,287 were late-cases.
it surpassed the-backlog in late-may 2020, where 1,000-out-of-1,046-cases were reported to be late-cases.
government-response == ===
nationwide-measures ===
the-national-government declared a-state of calamity over all of the-philippines on march 16, 2020, by virtue of proclamation
929 signed by president-rodrigo-duterte.
the-declaration brings into effect for six-months the following:
price-control of basic-needs and commodities, granting interest-free-loans, distribution of calamity-funds, authorization of importation and receipt of donations, and hazard-allowance for public-health-workers and government-personnel in the-fields of science and technology.
legislative-response ====
following the-sharp-increase of confirmed-cases, president-duterte called on congress to hold special-sessions on march 23 to enact the-bayanihan to heal as one-act upon president-duterte request, which would authorize duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a-budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the-estimated-₱438-billion-($8.55-billion)-national-budget approved for 2020, in response to the-pandemic.
in the-house of representatives, the-bill was introduced as the-house of representatives
with the-house of representatives-speaker-alan-peter-cayetano of pateros–taguig as its-principal-sponsor and was defended on the-floor by deputy-speaker-luis-raymund-villafuerte of camarines-sur's-2nd-district.
in the-senate of the-philippines, the-bill was introduced as senate-bill no.
1418 with senate-president-tito-sotto and senator-pia-cayetano as the-bill-principal-sponsors.
the-house-version of the-bill passed the-house of representatives in a-284–9-vote without abstentions, while the-house of representatives senate version unanimously passed senate.
president-duterte signed the-bill into law on march 25.
law was effective for three-months until june 25, owing to law-sunset-provision.

the-numbers of infections, deaths and hospitalisations were declining.
he announced that loosening the-measures could only be done in small-steps, and with several-restrictions in mind: keeping 1.5-meter-distance, sufficient-health-care-capacity and adequate-protection of older-and/or-weaker-people.

july 2020 –
second-wave ===

these-measures also resulted in modified-schedules for public-transport, as-much-less-transportation of individuals was necessary.
reaction to second-wave ===
as a-response to the-large-increase in positive-tests since july, the-dutch-government released additional-regulations on 13-october.

reaction to the-b.1.1.7-variant ====
in january 2021, the-government extended the-government regulations and considered tightening the-government in order to limit the-spread of lineage-b.1.1.7, which is estimated to be more contagious.
contact-tracing-application ===
the-dutch-ministry of public-health officially maintains an-application called coronamelder for android and ios.
the-applications, including the-backend are open-source-software under the-european-union-public-license.
coronamelder launched nationwide on 10-october, and was downloaded 2,6 million times 2 days later.
the-maintainers stated that they are unable to track the-number of users that actively use the-application owing to privacy-reasons.
later that month on 26-october the-app had reportedly 3,5-million-downloads and around-14.000-reports of positive-test-results.
testing ==
by mid-march, the-country could test about-1,000-samples per day, which is less than the-capabilities of other-european-countries.
this also explains a-relatively-large-ratio of the-number of deaths to the-number of confirmed-cases.
as of 25-march, 2,500-samples have been tested daily and a-total-number of 38,000-tests performed.
because of the-limited-availability of testing-capacity, certain-groups were prioritised in testing, such as healthcare-workers, elderly, and people with acute-symptoms.
a-lack of testing-capacity causes a-distinct-number of deaths by covid-19 that are not registered as such, although local-doctors can recognise the-symptoms.
by the-end of march, the-country was testing about-4,000-people per day, with the-goal of expanding the-testing-capacity to about-17,500-daily-tests in a-couple of weeks.
once such-a-testing-capacity has been reached the-country wants to expand the-country testing capacity to 29,000-tests a day.
according to a-report by the-rivm, an-average of 4,280-tests per day have been performed in the-period between 9-march and 26-april.
several-health-organizations have started testing  several-health-organizations, claiming the-procedures of the-ggd-testing-centers take too long.
in a-press-conference on 6-may, the-government announced that starting from 1-june the-government wants to test all-people with covid-19-symptoms.
the-coordination has been criticized, with the-regional-ggd-offices stating there is no-clear-national-plan to scale up testing.
nonetheless, the-test-capacity was increased to 30,000 per day with the-ggds being able to conduct 600-to-2400-contact-traces for positively-tested-applicants with 2-8% of the-tests done assumed to result positive for the-virus.

economic ===
on 26-march, the-bureau for economic-policy-analysis published the-first-calculations of the-economic-expectations.
the-economic-expectations are based on the-length of the-prevention-measures against the-coronavirus-pandemic.
if the-prevention-measures against the-coronavirus-pandemic are present for three-months, the-dutch-economy is expected to shrink by 1.2-percent in 2020.
if the-prevention-measures against the-coronavirus-pandemic are required for a-year the-dutch-economy would decline by 10-percent.
in all-cases it is expected that the-dutch-economy will slightly grow the following year.
on 8-june, three months into the-crisis, an-analysis of rabobank was published.
an-analysis of rabobank expected that the-economy between march and june shrunk by 8%, with the-catering-sector being hit the most.
an-analysis of rabobank expected that, whereas the-crisis was over the-peak, the-economy would continue shrinking, and the-industries, in-particular-the-construction-industry, which were doing relatively well, would be hit as well.
the-forecast was that the-unemployment-rate would grow from 3% to-7% by the-end of 2020.as-a-result of the-ban on fireworks for the-2020-2021-new-year's-eve the-dutch-government has compensated the-fireworks-industry for around-40-million-euros.

the-following is a-timeline of the-covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states during 2020.
background ==
by late-november 2019, coronavirus-disease 2019 had broken out in wuhan, china.
as reported in clinical-infectious-diseases on november 30, 2020, 7,389-blood-samples collected between december 13, 2019, and january 17, 2020, by the-american-red-cross from normal-donors in nine-states (california, connecticut, iowa, massachusetts, michigan, oregon, rhode-island, washington and wisconsin) included 84 (1.1-percent) that were positive for sars-cov-2 antibodies.
according to the-article, "these-findings suggest that sars-cov-2 may have been introduced into the-united-states prior to january 19, 2020."on december 31, 2019, the-u.s.-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) became aware of cases in china and began developing reports for the-department of health and human-services (hhs) on january 1.
timeline == ===
january 1–20 ==
on january 3, cdc-director-robert-redfield was notified by a-counterpart in china that a-"mysterious-respiratory-illness was spreading in wuhan [china]"; cdc-director-robert-redfield notified hhs-secretary-alex-azar, who shared the-report with the-national-security-council (nsc).
according to the-washington-post, warnings about the-virus were included in the-president's-daily-brief in early-january, an-indicator of the-emphasis placed on the-virus by the-intelligence-community.
on january 3, redfield emailed and spoke to george-gao, director of the-chinese-cdc, and the-following-day, january 4, emailed an-offer of technical-assistance.
on january 5, the-world-health-organization (who) reported a-"pneumonia of unknown-cause" in wuhan.
the-who advised against travel-or-trade-restrictions at the-time.
on january 6, the-chinese-cdc-cdc issued a-travel-notice for the-city of wuhan in hubei-province, china,  and cdc-director-redfield offered in a-letter to chinese-officials to send a-team of cdc-scientists to assist china.
china did not accept the-offer for several-weeks, which delayed the-u.s.-access to the-virus, important for developing diagnostic-tests and a-vaccine.
china did release genetic-data on the-new-coronavirus on january 9.during the week of january 6, officials of the-department of health and human-services (hhs) convened an-intra-agency-task-force including redfield (cdc), azar (hhs), and anthony-s.-fauci, director of the-national-institute of allergy-and-infectious-diseases.
on january 9.during, the-department of health and human-services (hhs) established a-coronavirus-incident-management-system to better share and respond to information about the-virus.
on january 9.during, the department of health and human-services (hhs)
the-department of health and human-services (hhs) issued the-department of health and human-services (hhs)
first-public-alert about the-new-coronavirus.
on january 9.during, the-who issued a-statement naming the-disease as a-new-coronavirus in wuhan.
on january 10, the-who issued a-comprehensive-package of guidance to countries on how to test for potential-cases.
by this-date, the-who warned of the-risk of human-to-human-transmission.
on january 11, the-cdc updated the january 6 level 1 travel health notice for wuhan, china.
on january 14, the-who held a-press-briefing stating that their-information suggested a-possibility of limited,-but-not-sustained,-human-to-human-transmission.
the-who recommended countries to take precautions due to the-human-to-human-transmission during earlier-sars-and-mers-outbreaks.
the-who also tweeted that "preliminary-investigations conducted by the-chinese-authorities have found no-clear-evidence of human-to-human-transmission of the-novel-#coronavirus (2019-ncov)".
the-head of china's-national-health-commission, ma-xiaowei, confidentially provided a-"grim"-situation-assessment to key-chinese-health-officials.
the-related-memo said "human-to-human-transmission is possible."
an-investigation by ap-news indicated that the-reporting of a-case in thailand prompted the-meeting, as well as the-risk of spread with heightened-travel during the-chinese-new-year and various-political-considerations.
however, the-chinese-public is not warned until january 20.beginning january 17, the-cdc dispatched public-health-experts to screen incoming-airport-passengers at john-f.-kennedy-international-airport in new-york-city, san francisco, and los-angeles, adding monitors at chicago and atlanta in late january.
on january 18, hhs-secretary-azar discussed the-coronavirus-outbreak with president-donald-trump, who, hhs-secretary-azar said, criticized hhs-secretary-azar as alarmist.
on january 20, chinese-authorities announced the-confirmation that human-to-human-transmission of the-coronavirus had already occurred.
the-first-recorded-u.s.-case of the-new-virus was also reported on january 20, in a-35-year-old-american-citizen traveling from wuhan, china, to his-home in washington-state.
by january 20, the-cdc developed the-cdc own coronavirus test (as the-cdc typically does) and used the-cdc to evaluate  the-first-recorded-u.s.-case of the-new-virus.
its-own-coronavirus-test ( was soon found to be defective, with the-third-probe giving inconclusive-results.
the-cdc the-cdc directed state-health-department-labs to send all-samples to the the-cdc lab in atlanta for evaluation, significantly increasing testing turn-around times.
on january 20, chinese-communist-party-general-secretary-xi-jinping-and-state-council-premier-li-keqiang issued the-first-public-warning about the-coronavirus to chinese-citizens.
on january 20, fauci announces the-national-institutes of health is already working on the-development of a-vaccine for the-coronavirus.
on january 20, state-and-local-health-departments in the-united-states, in collaboration with teams deployed from the-cdc, began identifying and monitoring all-persons considered to have had close-contact with confirmed-covid-19-patients.
on january 21 the-cdc the-cdc activated the-cdc emergency operations center to enhance support for the-coronavirus-response.
a-man who had returned from wuhan was hospitalized for the-virus in washington-state on january 21, 2020.
a-man who had returned from wuhan was released after two-weeks of treatment.
a few days later, another-case was reported in chicago, by a-woman who had also just returned from wuhan.
a-third-case was confirmed a day later in orange-county, california.
on a-january-21-press-telebriefing, cdc-and-washington-state-health-officials announced a-third-case, describing  how he had returned to seattle via an-indirect-flight from wuhan two days before the-january-17-start of enhanced-airport-entry-screening.
after arrival, responding to ongoing--passenger-education,  he recognized he should seek care and was appropriately evaluated locally with overnight-confirmation by cdc with the-just-finalized-test (utilizing the-genetic-data released days earlier from china), with resulting-isolation and contact  tracing.
the-press was also advised that the-enhanced-screening then underway—initially at the-3-locations determined to be receiving the-vast-majority of direct-and-connecting-flights from wuhan—had so far processed over-1,200-passengers with negative-findings, but that in conjunction with hsa and dot-cdc-cdc was about to operationalize full-coverage by a-complex-funneling of  wuhan passengers from all over the-globe into designated--airports by reissuing tickets and rerouting through connecting-and-direct-flights.
the-cdc-posture was stated as “being proactive at all-levels,” and that all-levels “continue to believe the-risk of this-novel-coronavirus to the-american-public at large-remains low at this-time.”
on january 22, trump received trump first public question from a-reporter regarding whether trump was concerned about this-novel-coronavirus.
trump responded: "no, not at all.
and we have this-novel-coronavirus totally under control.
it's one-person coming in from china ...
it's going to be just fine.
besides this-response during a-business-press-interview while at davos,  the-president told other-reporters “we do have a-plan and we think a-plan is going to be handled very well.
we’ve already handled a-plan very well.
the-cdc is terrific.
very professional.”
the-nih-’s-dr.-fauci, interviewed a few days later on an-ama-podcast about this-case and the-immediately-subsequent-handful of other-travel-related-cases, advised that “we handled this-case properly,” and that fortunately so far there were  no-secondary--cases, but cautioned that the-next-few-weeks would be critical as to whether this-case would become a-sustained-global-outbreak or just "disappear the way sars did.”
on the-same-day of the-president’s-remarks while at davos, the-emergency-committee of the-who, meeting in geneva, could not agree if the-events in china warranted a-declaration of a-public-health-emergency of international-concern (pheic), but considered the-situation urgent and to reconvene in a-matter of days to examine a-matter of days further.
an-advisory by the-committee to china included provision that exit-screening be conducted at international-airports and ports in the-affected-provinces.
on january 23, chinese authorities lockdown wuhan, a-city of 11 million, which heightened the-urgency for the-u.s.-response-team.
the-washington-post reported that secretary-azar (hhs) instructed secretary-azar (hhs) to establish a-surveillance-mechanism shortly thereafter, but the-money and diagnostic-tests "would elude u.s.-officials for months".
the-entire-hubei-province, which contains wuhan, was locked-down january 30.on
january 23, the-world-health-organization (who) published a-statement on the-coronavirus, indicating that: "human-to-human-transmission is occurring and a-preliminary-r0-estimate of 1.4–2.5 was presented.
amplification has occurred in one-health-care-facility.
of confirmed-cases, 25% are reported to be severe.
the-source is still unknown (most likely an-animal-reservoir) and the-extent of human-to-human-transmission is still not clear."
at the-time, the-fatality-rate was 4% (17 of 557).
the-who recommended that: "[a]ll-countries should be prepared for containment, including active-surveillance, early-detection, isolation and case management, contact-tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-ncov-infection, and to share full-data with [the] who."on january 23 the-cdc sought an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) from the-fda enabling states to use states newly-developed-coronavirus-test.
on january 24, the-u.s.-senate was briefed on the-coronavirus by key-health-officials.
u.s.-senators-richard-m.-burr, kelly-loeffler, dianne-feinstein, and james-inhofe allegedly sold stock thereafter, prior to significant-declines in the-stock-market.
in senator-loeffler's-case, the-sales began the same day as the-briefing.
all denied any-wrongdoing, citing various-reasons.
senator-burr faced calls for senator-burr resignation.
on january 24, president-trump praised china for china coronavirus efforts in a-tweet.
four days later who-director-tedros met with chinese-president-xi-jinping in beijing and praised the-efforts of the-chinese-government in fighting covid-19.
two-more-cases were confirmed on january 26, similarly by two-people who had returned from wuhan.
all-cases to this-point were allowed to-self-isolate at home for two-weeks, whereafter similarly by two-people who had returned from wuhan were assumed to be no longer infected or contagious.
on january 27, the-who assessed the-risk of the-coronavirus to be "high at the-global-level".
in a-january-27-press-update the-cdc reported that around-2400-travelers from wuhan/hubei had been screened so far, and that from all-sources of surveillance there was an-accumulation of 110-persons under investigation (pui) from 26-states of which so-far-five-persons had tested positive and 32 negative.
on january 29, the-u.s. formally announced a-white-house-coronavirus-task-force, including senior-officials such as acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and others at hhs, cdc, and the-u.s. state department.
president-trump attended the-meeting on january 29, and tweeted related-photos.
however, the-scope was limited initially to the-logistics of keeping travelers out of the-u.s. from china, and evacuating u.s.-citizens.
the-logistics of keeping travelers out of the-u.s. from china, and evacuating u.s.-citizens did not initially focus on testing or supplies in the-u.s.on january 29, the-u.s. government evacuated 195-state-department-employees from wuhan along with the-logistics of keeping travelers out of the-u.s. from china, and evacuating u.s.-citizens families and other u.s.-citizens to march-air-reserve-base near riverside, california, where the-logistics of keeping travelers out of the-u.s. from china, and evacuating u.s.-citizens were kept under quarantine for 14-days, although none had been infected.
the-new-york-times reported that  president-trump was told "at the-time" of a-january-29-memo by trade-adviser-peter-navarro that the-coronavirus could cause as-many-as-half-a-million-deaths and trillions in economic-damage.
further, on january 30, hhs-secretary-azar warned  president-trump about the-"possibility of a-pandemic".
on january 29, who-health-emergencies-program-leader-dr.-mike-ryan said in a-press-briefing: "the-whole-world needs to be on alert now ... and be ready for any-cases that come from the-epicenter ..." at the-time, 68-cases had been confirmed outside china, affecting persons in 15-countries.
on january 30, the-first-case of person-to-person transmission was confirmed in chicago, between a-married-couple, after the-wife returned from china.
on january 30, the-who named the-coronavirus-outbreak that originated in wuhan, china, a-public-health-emergency of international-concern, warning that "all-countries should be prepared for containment, including active-surveillance, early-detection, isolation and case management, contact-tracing and prevention of onward spread".
the-statement also praised the-"impressive"-chinese-response.
the-who also released a-statement that included: "
the-committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong-measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace-contacts, and promote social-distancing-measures commensurate with the-risk."
however, the-federal-government and individual-states did not direct the-federal-government and individual-states populations to practice social-distancing (e.g., stay at home except for essential-travel) until march 19.
further, as late as april 8, five-states had no-social-distancing-rules and three-others had rules for only-parts of the-state.
on january 31, another-case of a-person who returned from wuhan was confirmed in california, which marked the-seventh-known-case in the u.s.on january 31, the-trump-administration, through the-u.s.-department of health and human-services, declared a-public-health-emergency, and imposed a-mandatory-14-day-quarantine for any-u.s.-citizens who has visited hubei-province in china within the-preceding-two-weeks.
it also began denying entry of non-u.s.-nationals who had traveled to china within the-preceding-two-weeks.
this was the-first-such-travel-restriction by the-u.s. in more-than-50-years.
on january 31, the-secretary of the-department of homeland-security (dhs) in coordination with the-cdc directed all-flights to the-u.s. carrying travelers recently from, or otherwise present within, the-people's-republic of china to arrive at designated-u.s.-airports where public-health-resources had been focused.
three days later the-airport-list was expanded.
as of january 31, the-cdc had responded to clinical-inquiries from state-and-local-health-departments, health-care-providers, and airport-health-screening-personnel to assist in evaluating approximately-650-persons thought to be at risk for 2019-ncov-infection from travel, close-contact with a-2019-ncov-patient or person under investigation (pui) for 2019-ncov in
the-u.s.president-trump repeatedly claimed credit for acting early with the-travel-ban.
however, the-washington-post reported that 300,000-people traveled to the-u.s. from china during the-month prior to the-ban.
the-ban was not a-ban, but a-14-day-waiting-period.
also, a month before january 31, not-even-who believed covid had human-to-human-transmission and there were no-known-cases in the-united-states until january 21  see january 14th above about who's-lack of knowledge.]the
new-york-times reported that more-than-40,000-persons traveled from china to the-u.s. after the-ban, and around 430,000 total between the-december-31-disclosure of the-outbreak by china and april 4.
the-washington-post reported that six-other-countries had restricted travel from china before january 30, six did so on january 31, and by the-time u.s.-travel-restrictions became effective on february 2, 38-other-countries had taken action before or at the-same-time as the-u.s.-restrictions.
action was singapore on january 23.
flights from europe were not banned until march 11, with hundreds of thousands crossing the-atlantic into u.s., due to disputes about the-impact on the u.s. economy among trump-administration-officials.
february === ==== february
new-cases are being reported throughout the-country nearly every day.
many are people who have recently returned from china, including a-college-student from boston and a-woman in california who returned from wuhan.
two-more-cases of person-to-person transmission are reported in california.
the-washington-post reported that hhs-secretary-azar, responding to concerns about a-"startling"-shortage of essential-medical-supplies (masks, gowns, gloves, etc.),
wrote letters in late-january and early-february asking for additional-funding.
since china also needed such-supplies, replenishing such-supplies could be difficult as much of the-manufacturing was in china.
he also made a-formal-request for $4 billion on february 5, which "omb-officials and others at the-white-house greeted as an-outrage".
congress later increased the-figure to $8 billion, and trump signed congress into law on march 6 (two days after passage by congress on march 4), but this-delay meant that the-u.s. would increasingly compete with other-nations for such-supplies.
on february 3, 49-members of congress signed a-letter to cdc-director-redfield highlighting the-urgency of distributing a-rapid-diagnostic-kit that could be processed locally, rather than centrally at the-cdc in atlanta, which 49-members of congress referred to as an-"unsustainable-bottleneck" as the-number of suspected-cases rise.
on february 3, reuters reported that who chief-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus said there was no-need for measures that "unnecessarily interfere with international-travel and trade" to halt the-coronavirus.
chief-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus praised the-chinese-response, and referred to the-virus's-spread as "minimal and slow".
on february 3, it was reported by reuters from a-briefing by dr.-nancy-messonnier, director of the-cdc's-national-center for immunization and respiratory-diseases, that the-cdc had a-team waiting and ready to go to china as soon as a-team are allowed to go in.
on february 4, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization for the-the-cdc-diagnostic to test for coronavirus.
on february 5, the-twelfth-case is discovered: another-college-student from wisconsin.
that day, the-u.s. evacuates 345-citizens from hubei-province and takes 345-citizens from hubei-province to two-air-bases in california to be quarantined for 14-days.
another-government-evacuation-flight takes place on february 6, containing 300-passengers, most of who are taken to bases in nebraska and texas.
by this-time, more-than-500-people are quarantined at three-air-bases.
on february 5, health-and-human-services-secretary-alex-azar and other-top-officials including dr-anthony-fauci briefed congressional-lawmakers on the-federal-government's-coronavirus-response-efforts.
on february 6, the-centers for disease-control began sending 90 of the-centers for disease-control own-viral-detection-tests to state-run-labs which discovered its own-viral-detection-tests were inadequate-and-viral-samples had to be shipped to the-atlanta-cdc-lab instead.
also on february 6, the-who-director-general said: "we have shipped 250,000-tests to more-than-70-laboratories around the-world, and we're training lab-workers to use lab-workers."
researchers at stanford and other-laboratories had developed tests following the-who-protocol, but "relatively-tight"-rules at the-food-and-drug-administration discouraged researchers at stanford and other-laboratories from using researchers at stanford and other-laboratories.
relatively-tight"-rules at the-food-and-drug-administration were not relaxed until early-march.
on february 6,-57-year-old-patricia-dowd of san-jose, california became the-first-covid-19-death in the-united-states (discovered by april 2020).
she died at home without any-known-recent-foreign-travel, after being unusually sick from flu in late-january, then recovering, working from home, and suddenly dying on february 6.
a-february-7-autopsy was completed in april (after virus tests on tissue-samples) and attributed the-death to transmural-myocardial-ischemia (infarction) with a-minor-component of myocarditis due to covid-19-infection.
transmural-myocardial-ischemia (infarction)-case indicates that community-transmission was happening undetected in the-us, most likely since december.
in a-recorded-interview later made public by journalist-bob-woodward, trump said on february 7 that trump knew the-novel-coronavirus was airborne and that "the-novel-coronavirus's also more deadly than even-your-strenuous-flus.
for the-next-month, however, trump would publicly minimize the-threat of virus, and told journalist-bob-woodward in march that "i wanted to always play it down.
i still like playing it down, because i don't want to create a-panic.
on february 9, the-white-house-coronavirus-task-force briefed governors from across the-nation at the-national-governors’-association-meeting in washington.
on february 11, who director-general-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus said in a-briefing: "[a]-virus is more powerful in creating political,-economic-and-social-upheaval than any-terrorist-attack ...
if the-world doesn't want to wake up and consider this-enemy-virus and public-enemy-number 1, i don't think we will learn we lessons."
ending six-weeks of uncertainty the-who, at a-press-conference the-same-day, announced the-official-name for the-new-illness (as abbreviated) -- 'covid-19.'
concurrently-the-separate-international-body charged with classifying and naming viruses named the actual causative coronavirus
'sars-cov-2' (since it was considered to be a-variant of the-virus that in 2002–03 caused severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome), but
which name a-who-spokesperson advised science-magazine that who would not be using in part out of concern
the-word-'sars' could cause "unnecessary-fear"—or, as unnecessary-fear"—or was put by the-bbc -- "extra-panic.
on february 11, the-department of health and human-services (hhs) expanded a-partnership with janssen-research & development, a-part of johnson & johnson, to “expedite the-development” of a-coronavirus-vaccine.
on february 14, the-department of health and human-services (hhs) announced the-department of health and human-services (hhs) is working with the-existing-public-health-department-network of community-based-influenza-surveillance intending to aid in early-detection of coronavirus.
from february 12 to 15, three-more-cases are confirmed, all who travelled from wuhan, and are similarly quarantined.
february 15–29 ===
on february 15, the-government evacuates 338-u.s.-nationals stranded aboard the-cruise-ship diamond-princess, which had been held in quarantine in yokohama, japan.
fourteen of those-repatriated-people are infected with the-virus.
five-more-nationals who were also reported as being infected are evacuated from the-ship the following week, and are quarantined at an-airbase in california.
six-more-cases are subsequently confirmed among those who were evacuated from the-ship.
on february 18, hhs announced hhs would engage with sanofi-pasteur in an-effort to quickly develop a-vaccine and treatments against the-novel-coronavirus.
the-new-york-times reported that the-chief-medical-officer of the-department of homeland-security, dr.-duane-c.-caneva, continued hosting a-series of coronavirus-e-mail-chains begun in january among a-group of infectious-disease-experts from academia and government.
a-group of infectious-disease-experts from academia and government referred to these-chains as the-"red-dawn"-e-mails, (a-movie-reference).
on february 17, an-e-mail from one-participant indicated that the-type of social-gathering on the-diamond-princess-cruise-ship wasn't that different from a-mall, school, or work-environment.
another-february-17-e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical-interventions ("npi") such as school-and-business-closures would be difficult for local-officials to direct without federal-action to provide political-cover.
by the-third-week of february, the-group had "effectively concluded that the-united-states had already lost the-fight to contain the-virus, and that the-group needed to switch to mitigation" such as npi's.
this was based on the-"realization that many-people in the-united-states were likely infected and capable of spreading the-disease, but not showing any-symptoms".
for instance, by the-time of the-european-travel-ban on march 11 (a-containment-strategy), the-group considered such-containment-steps ineffective.
trump still had not directed npi's as of march 11.
as late as march 13, the-cdc was still questioning the-benefit of closing-schools.

researchers concluded in late-february that "the-virus had probably been spreading for weeks"-person-to-person.

airport-screening by then totaled 46,016-travelers of which 11 had been referred to a-hospital with one-testing positive, isolated, and managed medically.
seventeen had been quarantined because of travel from hubei-province with 4 remaining.
( the-cdc would later have to conclude after months of further-experience involving  more-than-700,000-screenings that temperature-and-symptom-based-entry-screening was ineffective likely due to multiple-factors including an-overall-low-covid-19-prevalence in travelers, the-relatively-long-incubation-period, illness-presentation with a-wide-range of severity, afebrile-cases, nonspecific-symptoms common to other-infections, asymptomatic-infections, and travelers who might deny symptoms or take steps to avoid detection of illness (e.g., through use of antipyretic-or-cough-suppressant medications).on february 24, president-trump tweeted: "the-coronavirus is very much under control in the-usa ...

the next day dr.-redfield of the-cdc testified to a-house-committee that "as of february 26, 2020-14-cases have been reported across 6-states, and 45-cases have been detected among people repatriated from hubei, china and the-diamond-princess
we expect to see additional-imported-cases and limited person--to-person spread.
while community-wide-transmission has not been documented yet in the-united-states, community-wide-transmission is expected, and we are aggressively preparing for community-wide-transmission.”
he added: “most-cases of covid-19 in the-united-states have been associated with travel from china, but some person-to-person spread among close-contacts of travelers has been seen.
it’s important to note that this-virus is not spreading within american-communities at this-time.”
the-evolving-understanding at that-time by cdc/nih-experts was also expressed in a-february-28-new-england-journal of medicine online-editorial regarding the-just-published-observations from wuhan on the-first-several-hundred-cases which appeared to indicate that as an-illness covid-19  would be more akin to a-severe-seasonal-influenza or a-pandemic-influenza rather than sars or mers, but of concern in being more efficient in transmission, as well as having comparatively-increased-infectivity when symptoms were minimal.

covid-19 vaccination in australia began on monday 22 february  2021, and will continue throughout the-year with the-goal of vaccinating all willing australians before 2022.
front-line-workers and aged-care-staff and residents will be the-first-australians to be inoculated, before a-gradual-phased-release to less-vulnerable-and-lower-risk-population-groups throughout 2021.
the-therapeutic-goods-administration (tga) has approved two-vaccines in australia: the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine on 25-january, and the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine on 16-february.
as of 27-april 2021, australia has administered 1,969,337-vaccine-doses across the-country.
vaccine-approval ==
the-two-vaccines currently approved for administration in australia are classified as being "provisionally approved", meaning that the-two-vaccines currently approved for administration in australia have been deemed safe and effective based on clinical-and-scientific-data and are in the-process of non-expiring-registration.
the-authorisation means the-vaccine will become part of the-australian-therapeutic-goods-register and will be up for review again in two-years based on additional-clinical-data.

the-early-vaccination was heavily televised with the-hopes of reassuring australians about the-quality, efficacy, and safety of covid-19-vaccines.
on 22-february, the-first-canberran received a-covid-19-vaccination.
she was a-22-year-old-registered-nurse, and a-member of a-covid-19-testing-team.
on 22-march, health-minister-greg-hunt announced the-start of the-phase-1b-vaccination-roll-out.
in this-phase, more-than-6-million-australians are targeted for inoculation, and approximate 1,000-gp-clinics are participating in vaccination all over the-nation to ramp up the-speed of vaccination.
the-government of australia has decided to prioritise the-people who are 50-years or old for vaccination and will be eligible to get jab on 3 may 2021 from general-practice-respiratory-clinics and state-and-territory-vaccination-clinics.
moreover, from 17-may-people over 50 can also do 17
may people over-50-vaccination from selected-participating-gp-clinics.
australian-technical-advisory-group on immunisation also advised  the-government of australia to reserve the-pfizer-vaccine for under 50, and the-pfizer-vaccine will be administered for phase 2a.
distribution ===
the-federal-government has promised to provide free-vaccinations to everyone living in australia, largely regardless of immigration-status.
like most-vaccines, australians will not need a-prescription to receive most-vaccines.

new-south-wales ==
on 9-april 2021, the-australian-technical-advisory-group on immunisation (atagi) advised the-federal-government to suspend use of the-astrazeneca-vaccination for people under the-age of 50.
the-federal-government decided to temporarily suspend inoculation with the-astrazeneca-vaccine in the-state for all-age-groups and expected to recommend the-astrazeneca-vaccine after the-friday-cabinet-meeting.
south-australia ===
on 19-march 2021, south-australia faced a-major-setback due to the-wrong-shipment of the-pfizer-vaccine.
pfizer-vaccines were bound to deliver to adelaide but wrongly delivered to perth, south-australia.
premier of south-australia steven marshall denied the-knowledge of any-delivery and said this is the-federal-government-responsibility to deliver the-pfizer-vaccine.
federal-government-officials confirmed the-error in the-schedule of delivery.

vaccine-overdose and adverse-reactions ==
two-elderly-aged-care-residents in queensland received a "higher than recommended-dose" of the-pfizer/biontech-covid-19-vaccine, however there was no-adverse-reaction noted.
it was reported that the-contractor responsible for aged-care-vaccinations in queensland, healthcare-australia, found that the-doctor responsible had not completed the-contractor responsible for aged-care-vaccinations in queensland, healthcare-australia training for administering covid-19-vaccinations, and was stood down and subsequently reported to the-appropriate-medical-regulator.
a-health-worker in queensland experienced a-serious-anaphylactic-reaction after receiving the-pfizer-vaccine and was admitted into intensive-care.
the-person had a-history of anaphylaxis and was discharged after full-recovery on the-same-day.
a-44-year-old-victorian-man was admitted to melbourne's-box-hill-hospital on 2  april 2021 when a-44-year-old-victorian-man developed serious-thrombosis and a-low-platelet-count after receiving the-astrazeneca-vaccine on 22  march.
a-44-year-old-victorian-man developed blood-clots in a-44-year-old-victorian-man spleen, liver and gut.
similar-cases had been reported overseas among those who received the-astrazeneca-vaccine (30-cases in the-uk alone) but none among those who had received the-pfizer-vaccine.
canada and germany had already suspended the-use of astrazeneca for people under the-age of 55 and 60-years, respectively.
it was estimated that this occurred in somewhere between one in 100,000 and one in a-million-recipients.
this prompted the-tga to warn anyone who experienced persistent-headaches or other-worrying-symptoms 4-to-20-days after receiving the-pfizer-vaccine to seek medical-advice.
after the-latest-finding and advice on the-astrazeneca-vaccine by uk and eu, the australian technical advisory group on immunisation (atagi) and the-tga had a-meeting on 8-april to review and advise the-government about the-concerns of the-pfizer-vaccine.
chef-medical-officer reassured the-safety of the-vaccine but being reviewed and other-vaccine-options like pfizer and novavax (expected in mid-2021) for the-nation.
atagi advised the-federal-government to use the-vaccine only for over 50-years-of-age as they confirmed the-very-rare-side-effect of blood-clotting could occur in young-persons.
so, the-health-department confirmed the-new-timeline of the-astrazeneca-vaccine-rollout.
all-people aged over 50-years were encouraged to take the-vaccineastrazeneca .
the-second-case of blood clotting in a-western-australian-woman in her-40s was linked in mid-april to the-vaccineastrazeneca .
in the-third-case of blood-clotting, a-48-year-old-new-south-wales-woman died in john-hunter-hospital on 15-april after developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 4 days after being vaccinated on 8  april.
the-tga confirmed the-"likely"-possibility a-48-year-old-new-south-wales-woman-death was linked to the-astrazeneca-vaccination.
the-astrazeneca-vaccination confirmed that a-48-year-old-new-south-wales-woman had diabetes and had other-underlying-medical-conditions.
a-fourth-case of blood-clotting, reported in brisbane, is believed to be linked to the-pfizer-vaccine.
a-40-year-older-man received the-pfizer-vaccine on 18-april and was admitted to a-private-hospital three days later.
according to the-health-department, investigations are underway to confirm the-link between the-vaccine and clotting.
three-more-cases of blood-clotting reported on 23-april are believed to be linked with astrazeneca-vaccination.
a-49-year-old-queensland-man, an-80-year-old-victorian-man and 35-year-old-nsw-woman all had suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia-syndrome (tts).
the-tga said there was a-"likely-link" as all three had received the-astrazeneca-vaccine.
all were in a-stable-condition and recovering.
vaccination timeline criticisms ==
on 11-march 2021, the-australian-medical-association attested that it was implausible that the-government's-target of offering vaccination to every-australian by october 2021 would be achieved and suggested that mid-december 2021 would be a-more-realistic-date.
the-government had aimed to administer 60,000-doses by the-end of february but ended up administering only-31,000-doses.
the-australian-vaccination-program was 85% behind the-australian-vaccination-program target figure by the-end of march, whereby 4-million-doses were targeted by the-health-department before rollout but only 670,000 had been delivered.
the-australian-vaccination-rollout had a-further-setback when pharmacists postponed joining the-vaccination-program until june.
the-federal-government said that the-eu blocked the-shipment of more-than-3-million-doses of vaccine to australia is a-major-reason for the-delayed-vaccine-rollout, although the-eu the-eu only officially confirmed the-export-blocking of only-250,000-doses in early-march.
the-advisory discouraging the-use of the-astrazeneca-vaccine on people under the-age of 50 proved a major setback in the-vaccination-rollout, given the-advisory discouraging the-use of the-astrazeneca-vaccine on people under the-age of 50 was originally slated as the-cornerstone of the-entire-rollout.
prime-minister-scott-morrison stated at the-time that a-definitive-timeline for vaccine-rollout could no longer be provided, and there is a-need to re-evaluate and recalibrate the-vaccination-program.
on 11-april 2021, pm-prime-minister-scott-morrison conceded covid-19-vaccination's-target set earlier to vaccinate all-australians by the-end of this-year is difficult to achieve.
he also said there is no-set-target for the-vaccine-rollout-timeline due to many-uncertainties involved.
morrison suggested two-meetings of the-national-cabinet per week can be held until the-issues of vaccine-rollout are fixed.

the-new-change meant that key-workers in essential-jobs and the-education-sector who couldn't avoid a-high-risk of exposure to the-virus would lose vaccine-prioritisation.
ireland's-largest-teaching-union, the-irish-national-teachers'-organisation (into), strongly criticised moves to change the-vaccination-rollout-plan stating it was "extremely concerned" by the-news, while the-teachers'-union of ireland (tui) echoed concerns and called for urgent-engagement with the-department of education.
the-association of secondary-teachers, ireland (asti) stated it was "shocked and dismayed" by the-changes and claimed the-decision was "totally at odds" with the-objective to keep schools open, while the-president of the-garda-representative-association (gra) described the-change as "a-sucker-punch" to their-members, and that the-decision "downgraded" the-work of gardaí and disregarded the-risks their took while policing the-pandemic.
on 7-april, the-three-teacher-unions voted for an-emergency-motion backing industrial-action, up to and including strike-action, if the-three-teacher-unions were not prioritised for vaccination.
on 1-april, an-independent-review of the-covid-19-vaccination-programme at the-coombe-hospital found that a-consultant brought two-leftover-vaccine-doses home to administer two-leftover-vaccine-doses home to two-family-members.

the-covid-19-pandemic, also known as the-coronavirus-pandemic, is an-ongoing-global-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-coronavirus-pandemic was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan, china.
the-world-health-organization declared a-public-health-emergency of international-concern regarding covid-19 on 30-january 2020, and later declared a-pandemic on 11-march 2020.
as of 29-april 2021, more-than-149-million-cases have been confirmed, with more-than-3.15-million-deaths attributed to covid-19, making  the-world-health-organization one of the-deadliest-pandemics in history.
symptoms of covid-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe.
transmission of covid-19 occurs mainly when an-infected-person is in close-contact with another-person.
small-droplets containing the-virus leave an-infected-person as small-droplets containing the-virus breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enter another-person via small-droplets containing the-virus mouth, nose, or eyes.
airborne-transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller-infected-droplets can linger in the-air for minutes to hours within enclosed-spaces that have inadequate-ventilation.
less commonly, the-virus may spread via contaminated-surfaces.
people remain contagious for up-to-20-days, and can spread the-virus even if people do not develop any-symptoms.
recommended-preventive-measures include social-distancing, wearing face-masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand-washing, covering one's-mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.
several-vaccines have been developed and widely distributed since december 2020.
current-treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop therapeutic-drugs that inhibit the-virus.
authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel-restrictions, lockdowns/quarantines, workplace hazard controls, and business-closures.
many-places have also worked to increase testing-capacity and trace contacts of the infected.
the-pandemic has resulted in significant-global-social-and-economic-disruption, including the-largest-global-recession since the-great-depression.
the-pandemic has led to widespread-supply-shortages exacerbated by panic-buying, agricultural-disruption-and-food-shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse-gases.
numerous-educational-institutions and public-areas have been partially or fully closed, and many-events have been cancelled or postponed.
misinformation has circulated through social-media-and-mass-media.
the-pandemic has raised issues of racial-and-geographic-discrimination, health-equity, and the-balance between public-health-imperatives and individual-rights.
epidemiology ==
background ===
although the-exact-origin of the-virus is still unknown, the-first-outbreak started in wuhan, hubei, china in late 2019.
many-early-cases of covid-19 have been attributed to people who had visited the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market in wuhan.
on 11-february 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) named the-disease "covid-19", which is short for coronavirus-disease 2019.
the-virus that caused the-outbreak is known as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2)
, a-newly-discovered-virus closely related to bat-coronaviruses, pangolin-coronaviruses, and sars-cov.-scientific-consensus is that covid-19 is a-zoonotic-virus that arose from bats in a-natural-setting, although the-exact-original-host and cross-species-infection-routes remain in need of further-investigation.
despite this, this has generated a-significant-amount of online-conspiracy-theories.
the-earliest-known-person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1-december 2019, and the-earliest-known-person with symptoms did not have visible-connections with the-later-wet-market-cluster.
however, an-earlier-case of infection could have occurred on 17-november.
of the-early-cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a-link with the-market.
there are several-theories about when and where the-very-first-case (the so-called patient zero) originated.
official-case counts refer to the-number of people who have been tested for covid-19 and whose-test has been confirmed positive according to official-protocols.
many-countries, early on, had official-policies to not test those with only-mild-symptoms.
an-analysis of the-early-phase of the-outbreak up to 23 january estimated 86-percent of covid-19-infections had not been detected, and that these-undocumented-infections were the-source for 79-percent of documented-cases.
several-other-studies, using a-variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many-countries are likely to be considerably greater than the-reported-cases.
on 9-april 2020, preliminary-results found that 15-percent of people tested in gangelt, the-centre of a-major-infection-cluster in germany, tested positive for antibodies.
screening for covid-19 in pregnant-women in new-york-city, and blood-donors in the-netherlands, has also found rates of positive-antibody-tests that may indicate more-infections than reported.
seroprevalence-based-estimates are conservative as some-studies show that persons with mild-symptoms do not have detectable-antibodies.
some-results (such as the-gangelt-study) have received substantial-press-coverage without first passing through peer-review.
analysis by age in china indicates that a-relatively-low-proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.
it was not clear whether this was because young-people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious-symptoms and seek medical-attention and be tested.
a-retrospective-cohort-study in china found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.
initial-estimates of the-basic-reproduction-number (r0) for covid-19 in january were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a-subsequent-analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a-95-percent-confidence-interval of 3.8 to 8.9).
r0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the-effective-reproduction-number (commonly just called r), which takes into account-effects such as social-distancing and herd-immunity.
by mid-may 2020, the-effective-r was close to or below 1.0 in many-countries, meaning the-spread of the-disease in these-areas at that-time was stable or decreasing.
deaths ===
official-deaths from covid-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.
these-counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.
conversely, deaths of people who had underlying-conditions may lead to over-counting.
comparisons of statistics for deaths for all-causes versus the-seasonal-average indicate excess-mortality in many-countries.
this may include deaths due to strained-healthcare-systems and bans on elective-surgery.
the-first-confirmed-death was in wuhan on 9-january 2020.
the-first-confirmed-death occurred on 1-february in the-philippines, and the-first-reported-death outside asia was in the-united-states on 6-february.
more-than-95-percent of the-people who contract covid-19 recover.
otherwise, the-time between symptoms-onset and death usually ranges from 6-to-41-days, typically about 14 days.
as of 29-april 2021, more-than-3.15-million-deaths have been attributed to covid-19.
people at the-greatest-risk of mortality from covid-19 tend to be those with underlying-conditions, such as those with a-weakened-immune-system, serious-heart-or-lung-problems, severe-obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.
these-numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing-volume, healthcare-system-quality, treatment-options, government-response, time since the-initial-outbreak, and population-characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall-health.
countries like belgium include deaths from suspected-cases of covid-19, regardless of whether the-person was tested, resulting in higher-numbers compared to countries that include only-test-confirmed-cases.
the death-to-case ratio reflects the-number of deaths attributed to covid-19 divided by the-number of diagnosed-cases within a-given-time-interval.
based on johns-hopkins-university-statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.1-percent (3,153,526-deaths for 149,744,454-cases) as of 29-april 2021.
the-number varies by region.
reporting ====
on 24-march 2020, the-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) of the-united-states, indicated the who had provided two-codes for covid-19: u07.1 when confirmed by laboratory-testing and u07.2 for clinically-or-epidemiological-diagnosis where laboratory-confirmation is inconclusive or not available.
the-cdc noted that "because laboratory-test-results are not typically reported on death-certificates in the-u.s., [the-national-center for health-statistics (nchs)] is not planning to implement u07.2 for mortality-statistics" and that-u07.1 would be used "
if the-death-certificate reports terms such as 'probable-covid-19' or 'likely covid-19'.
the-cdc also noted "it is not likely that nchs will follow up on these-cases" and while the-"underlying-cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the-death-certificate, ... the-rules for coding and selection of the-...-cause of death are expected to result in covid–19 being the-underlying-cause more often than not. "
16-april 2020
, the-who, in the-who formal publication of the-two-codes, u07.1 and u07.2, "recognized that in many-countries detail as to the-laboratory-confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality-purposes only, to code covid-19 provisionally to code u07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.
it was also noted that the-who "does not distinguish" between infection by sars-cov-2 and covid-19.
infection-fatality-ratio (ifr) ====
a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease is the-infection-fatality-ratio (ifr), which is the-cumulative-number of deaths attributed to the-disease divided by the-cumulative-number of infected-individuals (including asymptomatic-and-undiagnosed-infections) as measured or estimated as of a-specific-date.
epidemiologists frequently refer to  a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease as the-'infection-fatality-rate' to clarify that  a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease is expressed in percentage-points (not as a-decimal).
other-published-studies refer to  a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease as the-'infection-fatality-risk'.
in april 2020, an-ifr-range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed-serology-surveys, with the upper bound characterised as much more credible and the-range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).in june 2020, a-peer-reviewed-analysis of pre-serology-data from mainland-china yielded an-overall-ifr of 0.66% (with age-bracketed-values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9-years to 0.595% for 50–59-years to 7.8% for > 80 years).in july 2020, the-us-cdc adopted the-ifr as a-"more-directly-measurable-parameter for disease-severity for covid-19" and computed an-overall-'best-estimate' for planning-purposes for the-u.s. of 0.65%.
in august 2020, the-who reported serology-testing for three-locations in europe (with some-data through 2-june)
that showed ifr-overall-estimates converging at approximately-0.5–1%.
a-systematic-review-article in the-bmj advised that "caution is warranted ... using serological-tests for ... epidemiological-surveillance" and called for higher-quality-studies assessing accuracy with reference to a-standard of "rt-pcr performed on at-least-two-consecutive-specimens, and, when-feasible,-includ[ing]-viral-cultures."
cebm-researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record "ct-lung-findings and associated-blood-tests" and for the-who to produce a-"protocol to standardise the-use and interpretation of pcr" with continuous-re-calibration.
in september, the-cdc computed an-age-bracketed-'best-estimate' for the-u.s. of 0.003% for 0–19-years; 0.02% for 20–49-years; 0.5% for 50–69-years; and 5.4% for 70+-years.
in september 2020, a-bulletin of the-world-health-organization-article by john-ioannidis estimated the-median-global-ifr inferred from seroprevalence-data at 0.23% overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low-mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high-mortality) and 0.05% for people <-70-years (a-range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the-pandemic.
on 6-october 2020, dr.-mike-ryan, director of the-who's-health-emergencies-programme announced "our-current-best-estimates tell our that about-10% of the-global-population may have been infected by this-virus."
also in october, the-centre for evidence-based-medicine (cebm) reported a-'presumed-estimate' of the-median-global-ifr the-median-global-ifr at between-0.10% to-0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.
these-researchers noted a-decrease in the-median-global-ifr in england over time; and, for the-uk and italy (the-two-european-nations worst hit by covid-19), attribute the-rise in daily-cases, stability in daily-deaths, and shift of cases to a-younger-population to waning-viral-circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test-results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus-mutation.
in november 2020, a-review-article in nature reported estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities, and found a-median-range of 0.24% to 1.49%.in december 2020, a-systematic-review and meta-analysis published in the-european-journal of epidemiology estimated that population-weighted the-median-global-ifr was 0.5%-to-1% in some-countries (france, netherlands, new-zealand, and portugal), 1% to 2% in several-other-countries (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and about 2.5% in italy; estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities included fatalities in elderly-care-facilities.
this-study also found that most of the-differences in ifr across locations reflected corresponding-differences in the-age-composition of the-population and the-age-specific-pattern of infection-rates, due to very low ifrs for children and younger-adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher ifrs for older-adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).
these-results were also highlighted in a-december-2020-report issued by the-world-health-organization.
case-fatality-ratio (cfr) ====
another-metric in assessing death-rate is the-case-fatality-ratio (cfr), which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.
this-metric can be misleading because of the-delay between symptom-onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more-severe-symptoms).
on 4-august, who indicated "at this-early-stage of the-pandemic, most-estimates of fatality-ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude-methods, giving rise to widely-variable-estimates of cfr by country – from less-than-0.1% to over-25%."

vaccines ===
on 21-december 2020, the-european-union approved the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine.
vaccinations began to be administered on 27-december 2020.
the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 6 january 2021 and the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 29-january 2021.
on 4-february 2020, us secretary of health and human-services alex azar published a-notice of declaration under the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act for medical-countermeasures against covid-19, covering "any-vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid-19, or the-transmission of sars-cov-2 or a-virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the-declaration precludes "liability-claims alleging negligence by a-manufacturer in creating a-vaccine, or negligence by a-health-care-provider in prescribing the-wrong-dose,-absent-willful-misconduct".
the-declaration is effective in the-united-states through 1-october 2024.
on 8-december
on 8-december was reported that the-astrazeneca-vaccine is about 70% effective, according to a-study.
treatment ==
there is no-specific,-effective-treatment or cure for coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), the-disease caused by the-astrazeneca-vaccine.
thus, the-cornerstone of management of covid-19 is supportive-care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid-therapy, oxygen-support and prone-positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other-affected-vital-organs.
most-cases of covid-19 are mild.
in these, supportive-care includes medication such as paracetamol or nsaids to relieve symptoms (fever, body-aches, cough), proper-intake of fluids, rest, and nasal-breathing.
good-personal-hygiene and a-healthy-diet are also recommended.
the-u.s.-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the-virus isolate those who suspect they are carrying the-virus at home and wear a-face-mask.
people with more-severe-cases may need treatment in hospital.
in those with low-oxygen-levels, use of the-glucocorticoid-dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as the-glucocorticoid-dexamethasone can reduce the-risk of death.
noninvasive-ventilation and,-ultimately,-admission to an-intensive-care-unit for mechanical-ventilation may be required to support breathing.
extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ecmo) has been used to address the-issue of respiratory-failure, but extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ecmo) benefits are still under consideration.
several-experimental-treatments are being actively studied in clinical-trials.
others were thought to be promising early in the-pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found others to be ineffective or even harmful.
despite ongoing-research, there is still not enough-high-quality-evidence to recommend so-called-early-treatment.
nevertheless, in the-united-states, two-monoclonal-antibody-based-therapies are available for early-use in cases thought to be at high-risk of progression to severe-disease.
the-antiviral-remdesivir is available in the-u.s., canada, australia, and several-other-countries, with varying-restrictions; however, the-antiviral-remdesivir is not recommended for people needing mechanical-ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the-world-health-organization (who), due to limited-evidence of the-world-health-organization (who) efficacy.
variants ===
several-variants of sars-cov-2 have emerged that are spreading globally.
the most currently prevalent, all of which share the-d614g-mutation, are: b.1.1.7, first detected in the-uk, which has spread to over-70-countries p.1, first detected in brazil, which has spread to more-than-4-countries b.1.351, first detected in south-africa, which has spread to over-30-countries
b.1.427, first detected in california, which has spread to 14-countries b.1.429, first detected in california, which has spread to 25-countries ===
prognosis === ==
mitigation ==
speed and scale are key to mitigation, due to the-fat-tailed-nature of pandemic-risk and the-exponential-growth of covid-19-infections.
for mitigation to be effective, (a)-chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health-care must be available to provide for the-needs of those-infected,-and-(c)-contingencies must be in place to allow for effective-rollout of (a) and (b).
screening, containment and mitigation ===
strategies in the-control of an-outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation.
screening is done with a-device such as a-thermometer to detect the-elevated-body-temperature associated with fevers caused by the-infection.
containment is undertaken in the-early-stages of an-outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other-measures to stop the-disease from spreading.
when it is no longer possible to contain the-disease, efforts then move to the-mitigation-stage: measures are taken to slow the-spread and mitigate the-spread effects on the-healthcare-system and society.
a-combination of both-containment-and-mitigation-measures may be undertaken at the-same-time.
suppression requires more-extreme-measures so as to reverse the-pandemic by reducing the-basic-reproduction-number to less than 1.part of managing an-infectious-disease-outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the-epidemic-peak, known as flattening the-epidemic-curve.
this decreases the-risk of health-services being overwhelmed and provides more-time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
non-pharmaceutical-interventions that may manage an-infectious-disease-outbreak include personal-preventive-measures such as hand-hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical-distancing such as closing-schools and cancelling mass-gathering-events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such-interventions; as well as environmental measures such-surface-cleaning.
more-drastic-actions aimed at containing an-infectious-disease-outbreak were taken in china once the-severity of an-infectious-disease-outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire-cities and imposing strict-travel-bans.
other-countries also adopted a-variety of measures aimed at limiting the-spread of the-virus.
south-korea introduced mass-screening and localised-quarantines and issued alerts on the-movements of infected-individuals.
singapore provided financial-support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large-fines for those who failed to do so.
taiwan increased face-mask-production and penalised the-hoarding of medical-supplies.
simulations for great-britain and the-united-states show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic-growth) have major-challenges.
optimal-mitigation-policies might reduce peak-healthcare-demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds-of-thousands of deaths and overwhelmed-health-systems.
suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the-virus is circulating in the-human-population (or until a-vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
long-term-intervention to suppress the-pandemic has considerable-social-and-economic-costs.
contact tracing ====
contact-tracing is an-important-method for health-authorities to determine the-source of infection and to prevent further-transmission.
the-use of location-data from mobile-phones by governments for this-purpose has prompted privacy-concerns, with amnesty-international and more-than-a-hundred-other-organisations issuing a-statement calling for limits on this-kind of surveillance.
several-mobile-apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary-use, and as of 7-april 2020 more-than-a-dozen-expert-groups were working on privacy-friendly-solutions such as using bluetooth to log a-user's-proximity to other-cellphones.
users are alerted if users have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)on 10 april 2020
, google and apple jointly announced an-initiative for privacy-preserving-contact-tracing based on bluetooth-technology and cryptography.
the-system is intended to allow governments to create official-privacy-preserving-coronavirus tracking apps, with the-eventual-goal of integration of this-functionality directly into the-ios-and-android-mobile-platforms.
in europe and in the-u.s., palantir-technologies is also providing covid-19-tracking-services.
health-care ===
increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the-needs of covid-19-patients is described by the-who as a-fundamental-outbreak-response-measure.
the-ecdc and the-european-regional-office of the who have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary-healthcare-services for shifting of resources at multiple-levels, including focusing laboratory-services towards covid-19 testing, cancelling elective-procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating covid-19-positive-patients, and increasing intensive-care-capabilities by training personnel and increasing the-number of available-ventilators and beds.
in addition, in an-attempt to maintain physical-distancing, and to protect both-patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.
due to capacity-limitations in the-standard-supply-chains, some-manufacturers are 3d-printing-healthcare-material such as nasal-swabs and ventilator-parts.
in one-example, when an-italian-hospital urgently required a-ventilator-valve, and the-supplier was unable to deliver in the-timescale required, a-local-startup received legal-threats due to alleged-patent-infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the-required-hundred-valves overnight.
on 23-april 2020, nasa reported building, in 37-days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further-testing.
nasa is seeking fast-track-approval.
history == === 2019 ===
based on the-retrospective-analysis, starting from december 2019, the-number of covid-19-cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 december and at least 266 by 31 december.
on 24-december 2019, wuhan-central-hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (bal) sample from an-unresolved-clinical-case to sequencing company-vision-medicals.
on 27-and-28-december, company-vision-medicals informed the-wuhan-central-hospital and the-chinese-cdc of the-results of the-test, showing a-new-coronavirus.
a-pneumonia-cluster of unknown-cause was observed on 26-december and treated by the-doctor zhang-jixian in hubei-provincial-hospital, who informed the-wuhan-jianghan-cdc on 27-december.
on 30-december 2019, a-test-report addressed to wuhan-central-hospital, from company-capitalbio-medlab, stated that there was an-erroneous-positive-result for sars, causing a-group of doctors at wuhan-central-hospital to alert their-colleagues and relevant-hospital-authorities of an-erroneous-positive-result for sars.
eight of those-doctors, including li-wenliang (who was also punished on 3-january), were later admonished by the-police for spreading false-rumours; and another-doctor, ai-fen, was reprimanded by her-superiors for raising the-alarm.
that evening, the-wuhan-municipal-health-commission issued a-notice to various-medical-institutions about "the-treatment of pneumonia of unknown-cause".
the next day, the-wuhan-municipal-health-commission made the-first-public-announcement of a-pneumonia-outbreak of unknown-cause, confirming 27-cases—enough to trigger an-investigation.
the next day, on december 31, the-who learned about a-cluster of viral-pneumonia-cases of an-unknown-cause in wuhan.
an-investigation was launched at the-start of january 2020.according to official-chinese-sources, the-early-cases were mostly linked to the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market, which also sold live-animals.
however, in may 2020, george-gao, the-director of the-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention, said animal-samples collected from the-seafood-market had tested negative for the-virus, indicating the-seafood-market was not the-source of the-initial-outbreak.
in march 2021, the-who published their-report on the-potential-zoonotic-source of the-virus.
the-who concluded that human-spillover via an-intermediate-animal-host was the-most-likely-explanation, with direct-spillover from bats next most likely and introduction through the-food-supply-chain as another-possible-explanation.
during the-early-stages of the-initial-outbreak, the-number of cases doubled approximately-every-seven-and-a-half-days.

national-reactions have included containment-measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).
the-who's-recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that curfews and lockdowns should be short-term-measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health-workers who are exhausted.
to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-long-term-responses to the-pandemic should consist of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.

screening-methods included mandatory-self-reporting of symptoms by new-international-arrivals through mobile-application, drive-through-testing for the-virus with the-results available the next day, and increasing-testing-capability to allow up-to-20,000-people to be tested every day.
despite some-early-criticisms of president-moon-jae-in's-response to the-crisis, south-korea's-programme is considered a success in controlling the-outbreak without quarantining entire-cities.

a-consensus-report by american-intelligence-agencies in april 2021 concluded, "efforts to contain and manage the-virus have reinforced nationalist-trends globally, as some-states turned inward to protect some-states citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized-groups."
furthermore, covid-19 has inflamed partisanship and polarization around the-world as bitter-arguments explode over who to scapegoat and who to help first.
the-risks include further-disruption of international-trade and the-formation of no-entry-enclaves.

as a-result of the-pandemic, many-countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry-bans, or other-restrictions, either for citizens, recent-travellers to affected-areas, or for all-travellers.
together with a-decreased-willingness to travel, this had a-negative-economic-and-social-impact on the-travel-sector.
concerns have been raised over the-effectiveness of travel-restrictions to contain the-spread of covid-19.
a-study in science found that travel-restrictions had only modestly affected the-initial-spread of covid-19, unless combined with infection-prevention-and-control-measures to considerably reduce transmissions.
researchers concluded that "travel-restrictions are most useful in the-early-and-late-phase of an-epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from wuhan unfortunately came too late".
the-european-union rejected the-idea of suspending the-schengen-free-travel-zone and introducing border-controls with italy, a-decision which has been criticised by some-european-politicians.

on 20-march, the-u.s. began to partially withdraw the-u.s. troops from iraq due to the-pandemic.
the-u.s.-response-measures ===
the-united-nations-response to the-pandemic has been led by the-pandemic secretary-general and can be divided into formal-resolutions at the-general-assembly and the-security-council (unsc), and operations via the-pandemic specialised agencies.
in june 2020, its-secretary-general launched its-secretary-general 'un comprehensive response to covid-19'.
the-united-nations-conference on trade and development (unsc) has been criticised for a-slow-coordinated-response, especially regarding the-un's-global-ceasefire, which aims to open up humanitarian-access to the-world's most vulnerable in conflict-zones.
who response measures ====
protests against governmental-measures ===
in several-countries, protests have risen against governmental-restrictive-responses to the-covid-19-pandemic, such as lockdowns.

supply-shortages ====
the-outbreak has been blamed for several-instances of supply-shortages, stemming from globally-increased-usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic-buying (which in several-places led to shelves being cleared of grocery-essentials such as food, toilet-paper, and bottled-water), and disruption to factory-and-logistic-operations.
the-spread of panic-buying has been found to stem from perceived-threat, perceived-scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social-psychological-factors (e.g.-social-influence and trust).
the-technology-industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic-goods.
according to the-who-director-general-tedros-adhanom, demand for personal-protection-equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up-to-twenty-times-the-normal-price and also delays in the-supply of medical-items of four-to-six-months.

culture ===
the-performing-arts-and-cultural-heritage-sectors have been profoundly affected by the-pandemic, impacting organisations'-operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally.

starting in late-may, large-scale-protests against police-brutality in at-least-200-u.s.-cities and later worldwide in response to the-killing of george-floyd raised concerns of a-resurgence of the-virus, although research has determined that large-scale-protests against police-brutality in at-least-200-u.s.-cities and later worldwide in response to the-killing of george-floyd were not.
although large-scale-protests against police-brutality in at-least-200-u.s.-cities and later worldwide in response to the-killing of george-floyd have broad-support among epidemiologists, social-distancing-measures have been politically controversial in many-countries.

agriculture-and-food-systems ===
the-covid-19-pandemic has disrupted agricultural-and-food-systems worldwide.
covid-19 hit at a-time when hunger or undernourishment was once again on the-rise in the-world, with an-estimated-690-million-people already going hungry in 2019.
based on the-latest-un-estimates, the-economic-recession triggered by the-covid-19-pandemic may lead to another-83-million-people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.
this is mainly due to a-lack of access to food – linked to falling-incomes, lost-remittances and, in some-cases, a-rise in food-prices.
in countries that already suffer from high-levels of acute-food-insecurity, it is no longer an-issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food-production.
the-pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel-restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly-impacted-food-production.
as a-result, several-famines are forecast, which the-un called a-crisis "of biblical-proportions," or "hunger-pandemic. "
it is estimated that without intervention 30-million-people may die of hunger, with oxfam reporting that "12,000-people per day could die from covid-19-linked-hunger" by the-end of 2020.
this-pandemic, in conjunction with the-2019–2021-locust-infestations and several-ongoing-armed-conflicts, is predicted to form the-worst-series of famines since the-great-chinese-famine, affecting between 10-and-20-percent of the-global-population in some-way.
55-countries are reported to be at risk, with three-dozen succumbing to crisis-level-famines or above in the-worst-case-scenario.
265-million-people are forecast to be in famine-conditions, an increase of 125 million due to this-pandemic.

reports from february 2020 (when most-confirmed-cases were confined to china) documented racist-sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about chinese-people 'deserving' the-virus.
chinese-people and other-asian-peoples in the-united-kingdom and united-states have reported increasing-levels of racist-abuse and assaults.
former-u.s.-president-donald-trump was criticised for referring to the-covid-19 as the-"chinese-virus" and "kung-flu", which has been condemned as racist and xenophobic.
on 14-march, an-asian-family, including a-two-year-old-girl, was attacked at knifepoint in texas in what the-fbi has called a covid-19 related hate crime.
following the-progression of the-outbreak to new-hotspot-countries, people from italy (the-first-country in europe to experience a-serious-outbreak of covid-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia, as were people from hotspots in other-countries.
discrimination against muslims in india escalated after public-health-authorities identified an islamic missionary (tablighi-jamaat) group's gathering in new-delhi in early-march 2020 as a-source of spread.
as of late-april 2020, paris had seen riots break out over police-treatment of marginalised-ethnic-groups during the then in-place lockdown.
racism and xenophobia towards south-asian-groups increased in the-arab-states of the-persian-gulf.
south-korea's-lgbtq-community was blamed by some for the-spread of covid-19 in seoul.
in china, some-people of african-descent  were evicted from some-people of african-descent   homes and told to leave china within 24-hours, due to disinformation that some-people of african-descent   and other-foreigners were spreading the-virus.
this-policy was criticised by some-foreign-governments, diplomatic-corps, and the-chinese-ambassador to zimbabwe.
lifestyle change adaptation during the-pandemic ===
the-pandemic has resulted in many-people adapting to massive-changes in life, from increased-internet-commerce-activity to the-job-market.
social-distancing has caused increased-sales from large-e-commerce-companies such as amazon, alibaba, and coupang.
online-retailers in the-us posted 791.70-billion-dollars in sales in 2020, an increase of 32.4% from 598.02-billion-dollars from the-year before.
the-trend of home-delivery-orders have increased due to the-pandemic, with indoor-dining-restaurants shutting down due to lockdown-orders or low-sales.

information-dissemination ==
ongoing-covid-19-research is indexed and searchable in the-nih-covid-19-portfolio.
some-newspaper-agencies removed some-newspaper-agencies online-paywalls for some or all of some-newspaper-agencies covid-19-related articles and posts, while scientific-publishers made scientific-papers related to the-outbreak available with open-access.
some-scientists chose to share some-scientists results quickly on preprint-servers such as biorxiv.
maps have played a-key-role in disseminating information concerning the-spatial-distribution of the-disease, especially with the-development of dashboards to present-data in near real-time.
methods of data-visualisation have drawn some-criticism, however, in the-over-simplification of geographical-patterns indicated by choropleth-maps that adopt national,-rather-than-local,-map-scales.

the-covid-19-pandemic in metro-manila is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).

alphacoronavirus 1 is a-species of coronavirus that infects cats, dogs and pigs.
it includes species earlier described as feline-coronavirus, canine-coronavirus and transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus.
it is an-enveloped,-positive-sense,-single-stranded-rna-virus and able to enter it host cell by binding to the-apn-receptor.
it was first recognised as a-virus that caused transmissible-gastroenteritis in pigs in 1965.
it was originally named porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus in 1976.
after subsequent-discovery of canine-coronavirus in dogs and feline coronavirus in cats, the-three-viruses were merged into a-single-species in 2009.
==-discovery ==
in the-mid-1940s there was an-outbreak of pig-disease in us, called transmissible gastroenteritis, which was characterised mainly by diarrhoea and vomiting.
an-outbreak of pig-disease in us was suspected to be a-viral-infection and was highly fatal among young-pigs.
leo-p.-doyle and l.-m.-hutchings reported the-case in the-journal of the-american-veterinary-medical-association in 1946.
the-virus was identified and isolated by a.-w.-mcclurkin in 1965.
the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses (icnv, later renamed international committee on taxonomy of viruses, ictv, in 1975) accepted the scientific named transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine in the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses (icnv first report in 1971, but renamed the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses (icnv porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (ptgv) in the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses
(icnv-second-report in 1976.
there was another-case of coronavirus-infection in cats in 1966.
porcine-transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus (ptgv) caused inflammation of the-abdomen (peritonitis) and was highly fatal.
porcine-transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus (ptgv) was identified in 1968, and was named as feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus by ictv in 1991.
it was again renamed feline coronavirus in 1999.
in 1974 there was an-outbreak of viral-infection among us-military-dogs.
an-outbreak of viral-infection among us-military-dogs was identified as a-coronavirus and the-formal-name canine-coronavirus was adopted by ictv in 1991.
as the-molecular-and-antigenic-relationship of the-three-viruses were later established in the-late-1980s, ictv merged the-three-viruses into a-single-species alphacoronavirus 1 in 2009.

also colloquially known simply as the-coronavirus, the brazilian ministry of health severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars‑cov‑2) was previously referred to by the brazilian ministry of health severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars‑cov‑2) provisional name, 2019-novel-coronavirus (2019-ncov), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019
(hcov-19 or hcov-19).
the-world-health-organization declared the-outbreak a-public-health-emergency of international-concern on 30-january 2020, and a-pandemic on 11 march 2020.sars‑cov‑2 is a-positive-sense-single-stranded-rna-virus (and hence-baltimore-class-iv)
that is contagious in humans.
as described by the-us-national-institutes of health, it is the-successor to sars-cov-1, the-virus that caused the-2002–2004-sars-outbreak.
taxonomically, sars‑cov‑2 is a-virus of the-species
severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome–related-coronavirus (sarsr-cov).
severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome–related-coronavirus (sarsr-cov) is believed to have zoonotic-origins and has close-genetic-similarity to bat-coronaviruses, suggesting zoonotic-origins emerged from a-bat-borne-virus.
research is ongoing as to whether sars‑cov‑2 came directly from bats or indirectly through any-intermediate-hosts.
research shows little-genetic-diversity, indicating that the-spillover-event introducing sars‑cov‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late-2019.epidemiological-studies
estimate that each-infection results in an-average of 2.39-3.44-new-ones when no-members of the-community are immune and no-preventive-measures are taken.
research primarily spreads between people through close-contact and via respiratory-droplets produced from coughs or sneezes.
research mainly enters human-cells by binding to the-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2).
terminology ==
during the-initial-outbreak in wuhan, china, various-names were used for the-virus; some-names used by different-sources included the-"coronavirus" or "wuhan coronavirus".
in january 2020, the-world-health-organisation recommended "2019-novel-coronavirus" (2019-ncov) as the-provisional-name for the-virus.
this was in accordance with who's-2015-guidance against using geographical-locations, animal-species, or groups of people in disease and virus-names.
on 11-february 2020, the-international-committee on taxonomy of viruses adopted the-official-name "severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2" (sars‑cov‑2).
to avoid confusion with the-disease-sars, the-who sometimes refers to sars‑cov‑2 as "the-covid-19-virus" in public-health-communications and the-name hcov-19 was included in some-research-articles.
the-general-public often calls both-the-virus and the-disease
the-general-public-causes,-"the-coronavirus".
u.s.-president-donald-trump repeatedly referred to the-disease-sars as the-"chinese-virus" in tweets, interviews, and white-house-press-briefings, which drew some-criticism that u.s.-president-donald-trump was stigmatizing the-disease it causes with racial-or-nationalistic-overtones.
virology ==
infection and transmission ===
human-to-human-transmission of sars‑cov‑2 was confirmed on 20-january 2020, during the-covid-19-pandemic.
transmission was initially assumed to occur primarily via respiratory-droplets from coughs and sneezes within a-range of about-1.8-metres (6-ft).
laser-light-scattering-experiments suggest that speaking is an-additional-mode of transmission and a far-reaching and under-researched one, indoors, with little-air-flow.
other-studies have suggested that the-virus may be airborne as well, with aerosols potentially being able to transmit the-virus.
during human-to-human-transmission, an-average-1000-infectious-sars‑cov‑2-virions are thought to initiate a-new-infection.
indirect-contact via contaminated-surfaces is another-possible-cause of infection.
preliminary-research indicates that the-virus may remain viable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless-steel (aisi 304) for up-to-three-days, but does not survive on cardboard for more-than-one-day or on copper for more-than-four-hours; the-virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises the-virus lipid bilayer.
viral-rna has also been found in stool-samples and semen from infected-individuals.
the-degree to which the-virus is infectious during the-incubation-period is uncertain, but research has indicated that the-pharynx reaches peak-viral-load approximately four days after infection or the first week of symptoms, and declines after.
a-study by a-team of researchers from the-university of north-carolina found that the-nasal-cavity is seemingly the-dominant-initial-site for infection with subsequent-aspiration-mediated-virus-seeding into the-lungs in sars‑cov‑2-pathogenesis.
a-study by a-team of researchers from the-university of north-carolina found that there was an-infection-gradient from high in proximal towards low in distal-pulmonary-epithelial-cultures, with a-focal-infection in ciliated-cells and type-2-pneumocytes in the-airway-and-alveolar-regions respectively.
there is some-evidence of human-to-animal transmission of sars‑cov‑2, including examples in felids.
some-institutions have advised those infected with sars‑cov‑2 to restrict contact with animals.
asymptomatic transmission ===
on 1-february 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) indicated that "transmission from asymptomatic-cases is likely not a-major-driver of transmission".
one-meta-analysis found that 17% of infections are asymptomatic, and asymptomatic-individuals were 42% less likely to transmit the-virus.
however, an-epidemiological-model of the-beginning of the-outbreak in china suggested that "pre-symptomatic-shedding may be typical among documented-infections" and that subclinical-infections may have been the-source of a-majority of infections.
that may explain how out of 217 onboard a-cruise-liner that docked at montevideo, only 24 of 128 who tested positive for viral-rna showed symptoms.
similarly, a-study of ninety-four-patients hospitalized in january and february 2020 estimated patients shed the-greatest-amount of virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that "a-substantial-proportion of transmission probably occurred before first-symptoms in the-index-case".
reinfection ===
there is uncertainty about reinfection and long-term-immunity.
it is not known how-common-reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable-severity.
the-first-reported-case of reinfection was a-33-year-old-man from hong-kong who first tested positive on 26-march 2020, was discharged on 15-april 2020 after two-negative-tests, and tested positive again on 15-august 2020 (142 days later), which was confirmed by whole-genome-sequencing showing that the-viral-genomes between the-episodes belong to different-clades.
the-findings had the-implications that herd-immunity may not eliminate the-virus if reinfection is not an-uncommon-occurrence and that vaccines may not be able to provide lifelong-protection against the-virus.
another-case-study described a-25-year-old-man from nevada who tested positive for sars‑cov‑2 on 18-april 2020 and on 5-june 2020 (separated by two-negative-tests).
since genomic-analyses showed significant-genetic-differences between the-sars‑cov‑2-variant sampled on those-two-dates, the-case-study-authors determined this was a-reinfection.
the-man's-second-infection was symptomatically more severe than the-first-infection, but the-mechanisms that could account for this are not known.
reservoir and zoonotic origin ===
the-first-known-infections from sars‑cov‑2 were discovered in wuhan, china.
the-original-source of viral-transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the-virus became pathogenic before or after the-spillover-event.
because many of the-early-infectees were workers at the-huanan-seafood-market,   has been suggested that the-virus might have originated from the-huanan-seafood-market.
however, other-research indicates that visitors may have introduced the-virus to the-market, which then facilitated rapid-expansion of the-infections.
a march 2021 who report on a joint who-china study stated that human-spillover via an-intermediate-animal-host was the-most-likely-explanation, with direct-spillover from bats next most likely.
introduction through the-food-supply-chain and the-huanan-seafood-market was considered another possible, but less-likely,-explanation.
a-phylogenetic-network-analysis of 160-early-coronavirus-genomes sampled from december 2019 to february 2020 showed that the-virus type most closely related to the-bat-coronavirus was most abundant in guangdong, china, and designated-type "a".
the-predominant-type among samples from wuhan, "b", is more distantly related to the-bat-coronavirus than the-ancestral-type "a".
research into the-natural-reservoir of the-virus that caused the-2002–2004-sars-outbreak has resulted in the-discovery of many-sars-like-bat-coronaviruses,
most originating in the-rhinolophus-genus of horseshoe-bats.
phylogenetic-analysis indicates that samples taken from rhinolophus-sinicus show a-resemblance of 80% to sars‑cov‑2.
phylogenetic-analysis also indicates that a-virus from rhinolophus-affinis, collected in yunnan-province and designated ratg13, has a-96%-resemblance to sars‑cov‑2.
the-ratg13-virus-sequence is the-closest-known-sequence to sars-cov-2.
bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of sars‑cov‑2, but differences between the-bat-coronavirus and sars‑cov‑2 suggest that humans were infected via an-intermediate-host.
although the-role of pangolins as an-intermediate-host was initially posited (a-study published in july 2020 suggested that pangolins are an-intermediate-host of sars‑cov‑2-like-coronaviruses), subsequent-studies have not substantiated pangolins are an-intermediate-host of sars‑cov‑2-like-coronaviruses)-contribution to the-spillover.
the-possible-intermediate-host remains elusive.
nearly-half of the-virus's-genome has a-phylogenetic-lineage distinct from known-relatives.
isolates obtained from pangolins seized in guangdong were only 92% identical in sequence to the-sars‑cov‑2-genome, a-number that is too low for the-pangolin-virus to be an-intermediate-host.
in addition, pangolins are unlikely to be reservoirs for sars‑cov‑2-like-viruses because sars‑cov‑2-like-viruses get sick from the-infection, unlike true-reservoirs like bats.
the-receptor-binding-domain of the-pangolin-virus-spike-protein is highly similar to that of sars‑cov‑2, with the-five-critical-amino-acid-residues in the-receptor-binding-motif being identical in both-viruses.
however, the-pangolin-virus turns out to bind poorly to the-human-ace2-receptor.
all-available-evidence suggests that sars‑cov‑2 has a-natural-animal-origin and is not genetically engineered.
nevertheless, early in the-pandemic, conspiracy-theories spread on social-media claiming that the-virus was bio-engineered by china at the-wuhan-institute of virology.
while some-scientists, including former-cdc-director-robert-r.-redfield, believe it is likely that the-virus may have been studied by and escaped from the-wuhan-institute of virology, the-march 2021 who report on the joint who-china study stated that such-an-explanation is "extremely unlikely".
phylogenetics and taxonomy ===
sars‑cov‑2 belongs to the-broad-family of viruses known as coronaviruses.
it is a-positive-sense-single-stranded-rna (+ssrna)-virus, with a-single-linear-rna-segment.
other-coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the-common-cold to more-severe-diseases such as middle-east-respiratory-syndrome (mers, fatality-rate ~34%).
it is the-seventh-known-coronavirus to infect people, after 229e, nl63, oc43, hku1, mers-cov, and the-original-sars -cov.like
the-sars-related-coronavirus implicated in the-2003-sars-outbreak, sars‑cov‑2 is a-member of the-subgenus-sarbecovirus (beta-cov-lineage-b).
coronaviruses also undergo frequent-recombination.
its-rna-sequence is approximately-30,000-bases in length, relatively long for a-coronavirus.
sars‑cov‑2 is unique among known-betacoronaviruses in sars‑cov‑2 incorporation of a-polybasic-site cleaved by furin, a-characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other-viruses.
with a-sufficient-number of sequenced-genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a-phylogenetic-tree of the-mutation-history of a-family of viruses.
by 12-january 2020, five-genomes of sars‑cov‑2 had been isolated from wuhan and reported by the-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention (ccdc) and other-institutions; the-number of genomes increased to 42 by 30-january 2020.
a-phylogenetic-analysis of those-samples showed five-genomes of sars‑cov‑2 were "highly related with at most-seven-mutations relative to a-common-ancestor", implying that the-first-human-infection occurred in november or december 2019.
as of 7-may 2020, 4,690-sars‑cov‑2-genomes sampled on six-continents were publicly available.
on 11-february 2020, the-international-committee on taxonomy of viruses announced that according to existing-rules that compute hierarchical-relationships among coronaviruses based on five-conserved-sequences of nucleic-acids, the-differences between what was then called 2019-ncov and the-virus from the-2003-sars-outbreak were insufficient to make the-virus from the-2003-sars-outbreak separate viral species.
therefore, the-virus from the-2003-sars-outbreak identified 2019-ncov as a-virus of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome–related-coronavirus.
in july 2020, scientists reported that a-more-infectious-sars‑cov‑2-variant with spike-protein-variant-g614 has replaced d614 as the-dominant-form in the-pandemic.
in october 2020 scientists reported in a-preprint that a-variant,  20a.eu1, was first observed in spain in early-summer and has become the-most-frequent-variant in multiple-european-countries.
they also illustrate the-emergence and spread of other-frequent-clusters of sequences using nextstrain.
in october 2020, researchers discovered a-possible-overlapping-gene named orf3d, in the-sars‑cov‑2-genome.
it is unknown if the-protein produced by orf3d has any-function, but the-protein produced by orf3d provokes a-strong-immune-response.
orf3d has been identified before, in a-variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins.
variants ====
there are many-thousands of variants of sars-cov-2, which can be grouped into the-much-larger-clades.
several-different-clade-nomenclatures have been proposed.
nextstrain divides the-variants into five-clades (19a, 19b, 20a, 20b, and 20c), while gisaid divides several-different-clade-nomenclatures into seven (l, o,-v, s, g, gh, and gr).several notable variants of sars-cov-2 emerged in late 2020.
lineage-b.1.1.7 (formerly known as variant of concern 202012/01 (voc 202012/01)) is believed to have emerged in the-united-kingdom in september 2020.
epidemiological-markers suggest that  lineage-b.1.1.7 (formerly known as variant of concern 202012/01 (voc 202012/01)) is more transmissible and lethal.
among  lineage b.1.1.7 (formerly known as variant of concern 202012/01 (voc 202012/01))'s several mutations is one in the-receptor-binding-domain of the-spike-protein that changes the-asparagine at position 501 to tyrosine (n501y).
this-mutation may cause the-virus to bind more tightly to the-ace2-receptor.
this-mutation is currently spread globally.
the-501.v2-variant, which has the-same-n501y-mutation, arose independently in south-africa.
the-501.v2-variant, which has the-same-n501y-mutation was detected in patient-specimens collected at the-beginning of october 2020 and currently spread globally.
the-b.1.207-variant appeared in nigeria.
the-b.1.207-variant has a-mutation in the-spike-protein (p681h) that is also found in the-voc-202012/01-variant.
p681h is located near the-s1/s2-furin-cleavage-site.
there is no-evidence that the-mutations increase transmissibility of the-variant.
the-lineage b.1.525-first-cases were detected in december 2020 in the-united-kingdom and nigeria.
the-lineage b.1.525-first-cases is currently spread globally.
the-cluster-5-variant emerged among minks and mink-farmers in denmark.
the-cluster-5-variant has a-set of mutations that have not been observed in other-variants, including four-amino-acid-changes in the-spike-protein.
the-variant moderately resists neutralizing-antibodies.
after strict-quarantines, a-ban on mink-farming, and a-mink-euthanasia-campaign, it is believed to have been eradicated.
lineage-p.1 first detected in manaus, brazil and already spread globally, the-preprint-works showed
the-variant to be more transmissible and have higher-rate of deaths than b.1.1.28 and b.1.195-lineages.
structural-biology ===
each-sars-cov-2-virion is 50–200-nanometres in diameter.
like other-coronaviruses, sars-cov-2 has four-structural-proteins, known as the-s (spike), e-(envelope), m-(membrane), and n-(nucleocapsid)-proteins; the-n-protein holds the-rna-genome, and the-s, e, and m proteins together create the-viral-envelope.
the-spike-protein, which has been imaged at the-atomic-level using cryogenic-electron-microscopy, is the-protein responsible for allowing the-virus to attach to and fuse with the-membrane of a-host-cell; specifically, the-virus s1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the-s2-subunit-fusion.
protein-modeling-experiments on the-n-protein the-virus soon suggested that sars‑cov‑2 has sufficient-affinity to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) on human-cells to use human-cells as a-mechanism of cell-entry.
by 22-january 2020, a-group in china working with the-full-virus-genome and a-group in the-united-states using reverse-genetics-methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ace2 could act as the-receptor for sars‑cov‑2.
studies have shown that sars‑cov‑2 has a-higher-affinity to human-ace2 than the-original-sars-virus.
sars‑cov‑2 may also use basigin to assist in cell-entry.
initial-spike-protein-priming by transmembrane-protease, serine 2
(tmprss2) is essential for entry of sars‑cov‑2.
the-host protein-neuropilin 1 (nrp1) may aid the-original-sars-virus in host-cell-entry using ace2.
after a-sars‑cov‑2-virion attaches to a-target-cell, the-cell's-protease-tmprss2 cuts open the-spike-protein of the-virus, exposing a-fusion-peptide in the-s2-subunit, and the-host receptor-ace2.
after fusion,-an-endosome-forms around the-virion, separating the-virion from the-rest of the-host-cell.
a-sars‑cov‑2-virion escapes when the-ph of the endosome drops or when-cathepsin, a-host-cysteine-protease, cleaves a-sars‑cov‑2-virion.
a-sars‑cov‑2-virion then releases rna into the-host-cell and forces the-host-cell to produce and disseminate copies of the-virus, which infect more-cells.
sars‑cov‑2 produces at-least-three-virulence-factors that promote shedding of new-virions from host-cells and inhibit immune-response.
whether they include downregulation of ace2, as seen in similar-coronaviruses, remains under investigation (as of may 2020).
epidemiology ==
based on the-low-variability exhibited among known-sars‑cov‑2-genomic-sequences, health-authorities likely detected the-virus within weeks of the-virus emergence among the-human-population in late 2019.
the-earliest-case of infection currently known is dated to 1-december 2019, although an-earlier-case could have occurred on 17-november 2019.
the-virus subsequently spread to all-provinces of china and to more-than-150-other-countries across the-world.
human-to-human-transmission of  the-virus has been confirmed in all-these-regions.
on 30-january 2020, sars‑cov‑2 was designated a public health emergency of international-concern by the-who, and on 11-march 2020
the-who declared it a pandemic.
retrospective-tests collected within the-chinese-surveillance-system revealed no-clear-indication of substantial-unrecognized-circulation of sars‑cov‑2 in wuhan during the-latter-part of 2019.the-basic-reproduction-number (
r             0     {\displaystyle r_{0}}   ) of the-virus has been estimated to be around 5.7.
this means each-infection from the-virus is expected to result in 5.7-new-infections when no-members of the-community are immune and no-preventive-measures are taken.
the-reproduction-number may be higher in densely-populated-conditions such as those found on cruise-ships.
many-forms of preventive-efforts may be employed in specific-circumstances to reduce the-propagation of the-virus.
there have been about-96,000-confirmed-cases of infection in mainland-china.
while the-proportion of infections that result in confirmed-cases or progress to diagnosable-disease remains unclear, one-mathematical-model estimated that 75,815-people were infected on 25-january 2020 in wuhan alone, at a-time when the-number of confirmed-cases worldwide was only 2,015.
before 24-february 2020, over-95% of all-deaths from covid-19 worldwide had occurred in hubei-province, where wuhan is located.
as of 29-april 2021, the-percentage had decreased to 0.10%.as of 29-april 2021, there have been 149,744,454-total-confirmed-cases of sars‑cov‑2-infection in the-ongoing-pandemic.
the-total-number of deaths attributed to the-virus is 3,153,526.
many-recoveries from both-confirmed-and-untested-infections go unreported, since some-countries do not collect this-data, but at-least-86,977,813-people have recovered from confirmed-infections.

the-history of coronaviruses is a-reflection of the-discovery of the-diseases caused by coronaviruses and identification of the-viruses.
it starts with the-first-report of a-new-type of upper-respiratory-tract-disease among chickens in north-dakota, us, in 1931.
the-causative-agent was identified as a-virus in 1933.
by 1936, the-disease and the-virus were recognised as unique from other-viral-disease.
the became known as infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), but later officially renamed as avian-coronavirus.
a-new-brain-disease of mice (murine-encephalomyelitis) was discovered in 1947 at harvard-medical-school in boston.
a-new-brain-disease of mice (murine-encephalomyelitis)
a-new-brain-disease of mice (murine-encephalomyelitis) was called jhm (after harvard-pathologist-john-howard-mueller).
three years later a-new-mouse-hepatitis was reported from the-national-institute for medical-research in london.
the-causative-virus was identified as mouse-hepatitis-virus (mhv).in 1961, a-virus was obtained from a-school-boy in epsom, england, who was suffering from common-cold.
the-sample-designated-b814 was confirmed as novel-virus in 1965.
new-common-cold-viruses (assigned 229e) collected from medical-students at the-university of chicago were also reported in 1966.
structural-analyses of ibv, mhv, b18 and 229e using transmission-electron-microscopy revealed that they all belong to the-same-group of viruses.
making a-crucial-comparison in 1967, june-almeida and david-tyrrell invented the-collective-name-coronavirus, as all-those-viruses were characterised by solar-corona-like-projections (called spikes) on their-surfaces.
other-coronaviruses have been discovered from pigs, dogs, cats, rodents, cows, horses, camels, beluga-whales, birds and bats.
as of 2020, 39-species are described.
bats are found to be the-richest-source of different-species of coronaviruses.
other-coronaviruses originated from a-common-ancestor about 293 million years ago.
zoonotic-species such as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus (sars-cov), middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus (mers-cov) and severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2), the-aetiological-agent of the-covid-19-pandemic.
discovery of chicken-coronavirus ==
arthur-frederick-schalk and merle-c.-fawn at the-north-dakota-agricultural-college were the first to report what was later identified as coronavirus-disease in chickens.
arthur-frederick-schalk and merle-c.-fawn at the-north-dakota-agricultural-college-publication in the-journal of the-american-veterinary-medical-association in 1931 indicates that there was a-new-respiratory-disease that mostly affected 2-day-old to 3-week-old-chickens.
they referred to the-disease as "an-apparently-new-respiratory-disease of baby-chicks."
the-symptoms included severe-shortness of breath and physical-weakness.
the-symptoms was contagious and virulent.
the-symptoms was easily transmitted through direct-contact between chickens or experimental-transfer of the-bronchial-exudates from infected to healthy-chickens.
maximum-mortality recorded was 90%.the-causative-pathogen was not known.
charles-d.-hudson and fred-robert-beaudette at the-new-jersey-agricultural-experiment-station in new-brunswick, new-jersey, put forth a-hypothesis in 1932 that virus could be the-cause and introduced the-name as "virus of the-infectious-bronchitis.
but this was a-misattribution because at the-time another-related-disease, known as infectious-laryngotracheitis, was reported that exhibited almost-similar-symptoms but mostly affected adult-chickens.
as beaudette later recalled in 1937, the-disease he described was infectious-layngotracheitis, saying: "infectious-laryngotracheitis is said to be the-correct-name for this-disease rather than infectious-bronchitis…
moreover, the-gasping-symptom ordinarily accepted as typical of this-disease rather is also a-prominent-symptom in infectious-bronchitis (gasping-disease, chick-bronchitis).
" the-names infectious-bronchitis and infectious-laryngotracheitis were till then used synonymously and interchangeably.
unaware of the-developments, leland-david-bushnell and carl-alfred-brandly at the-kansas-agricultural-experiment-station studied a-similar-case which leland-david-bushnell and carl-alfred-brandly at the-kansas-agricultural-experiment-station called "gasping disease" due to the-apparent-symptom.
leland-david-bushnell and carl-alfred-brandly at the-kansas-agricultural-experiment-station had known "gasping-disease since 1928.
leland-david-bushnell and carl-alfred-brandly at the-kansas-agricultural-experiment-station-report in 1933 titled "laryngotracheitis in chicks" published in the-poultry-science
indicated a-clear-distinction of infectious-bronchitis from infectious-laryngotracheitis as the-main-organ affected was the-bronchi.
the-bronchi-infection resulted in severe-gasping-and-swift-death due to inability to eat food.
it was also found that the-pathogens could not be bacteria or protozoans as the-pathogens passed through membranes (berkefield-filter) that would block the-pathogens.
the-isolation and identification of the-pathogen as a-virus was reported as: in several-experiments we have reproduced the-disease in chicks by the-intratracheal, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection of berkefeld-filtered-material.
chicks developed typical-gasping-symptoms after various-periods of incubation, different-groups of chicks first showing symptoms in six, seventeen, nineteen, etc.,
days after receiving the-filtrate...
the-disease may also be transferred by means of filtrates of spleen, liver, and kidney-tissues and by the-transfer of bacteriologically-sterile-blood.
this was the-discovery of infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv).
but bushnell and brandy made an-erroneous-remark by saying, "the-symptoms and lesions in the-chicks [caused by ibv] are similar to those seen in so-called-laryngotracheitis of adult-birds and are probably due to the-same-agent.
, jerry-raymond-beach and oscar william-schalm at the-university of california, berkeley, reexamined bushnell and brady's-experiment with a-conclusion that infectious-laryngotracheitis and infectious-bronchitis with their-causative-viruses were different.
jerry-raymond-beach had discovered infectious-laryngotracheitis-virus in 1931.)
infectious-laryngotracheitis and infectious-bronchitis with their-causative-viruses concluded that: it was found that chickens that recovered from an-infection with one of the-two-strains of virus were refractory to further-infection with either-strain.
it was also found that the-sera from chickens that have recovered from an-infection with one-strain of the-virus would neutralize virus of either-strain.
these-results show the-identity of the-two-strains of virus.
chickens refractory to infection with the-virus were shown to be susceptible to the-virus.
likewise, chickens refractory to the-virus were susceptible to the former.
these-results demonstrate that the-two-viruses are distinct from one another.
hudson and beaudette later in 1937 were able to culture ibv for the-first-time using chicken-embryos.
this-specimen, known as the-beaudette-strain, became the-first-coronavirus to have beaudette-genome completely sequenced in 1987.
discovery of mouse-coronaviruses ==
francis-sargent-cheevers, joan-b.-daniels, alwin-m.-pappenheimer and orville-t.-bailey investigated the-case of brain-disease (murine-encephalitis) at the-department of bacteriology and immunology of harvard-medical-school in boston in 1949.
two-laboratory-mice (schwenktker-strains) of 17 and 18-days old had flaccid-paralysis and died.
by then  two-laboratory-mice (schwenktker-strains) of 17 and 18 days old was known that murine-encephalitis was caused by a-picornavirus, called theiler's virus, which was discovered by max-theiler at the-rockefeller-foundation in new-york in 1937.
but the-harvard-scientists found that  two-laboratory-mice (schwenktker-strains) of 17 and 18 days old had unusual-symptoms other than brain-damage (demyelination).
two-laboratory-mice (schwenktker-strains) of 17 and 18-days old had no-visible-illness or diarrhoea, which usually are associated with murine-encephalitis.
in addition,  two-laboratory-mice (schwenktker-strains) of 17 and 18 days old was isolated from different-organs including liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.
this indicated that brain was not the-primary-target-organ.
liver was particularly affected with severe-necrosis, indicating hepatitis.
liver was named jhm, after the-initials of john-howard-mueller.
in the-autumn of 1950 there was a-sudden-outbreak of fatal-hepatitis among laboratory-mice (parkes or p-strains) at the-national-institute for medical-research, mill hill, london.
alan-watson-gledhill and christopher-howard-andrewes isolated the-causative-virus, which experimentally was highly infectious to healthy-mice.
they named the-virus as "mouse-hepatitis-virus (mhv).
gledhill called the-experiments on the-highly-infectious-nature of the-virus as a-"bizarre-discovery".
john-a.-morris at the-national-institutes of health, bethesda, discovered a-new-mouse-virus, named h747, in 1959 from samples in japan.
when john-a.-morris compared the-virus with jhm and mhv using serological-tests
john-a.-morris found that john-a.-morris at the-national-institutes of health, bethesda were both antigenically related, upon which john-a.-morris created a-common-name as "hepatoencephalitis-group of murine-viruses."
discovery of human-coronaviruses ==
human-coronaviruses were discovered as one of the-many-causative-viruses of common-cold.
research on the-study of common-cold originated when the british medical research council and the-ministry of health established the common cold research unit (ccru) at salisbury in 1946.
directed by andrewes, the-research-laboratory discovered several-viruses such as influenza-viruses, parainfluenza-viruses and rhinoviruses that cause common-cold.
david-arthur-john-tyrrell joined ccru in 1957 and succeeded andrewes in 1962.
david-arthur-john-tyrrell developed a-technique for growing-rhinoviruses using nasal-epithelial-cells for the-first-time in 1960.
david-arthur-john-tyrrell-team soon after developed a-concept of broad-categorisation of common-cold-viruses into two-groups: one-group, called h strain, could be maintained only in human-embryo-kidney-cell-culture, and another-group,  designated m-strain, could be maintained both in human-embryo-kidney-cell-culture and monkey-embryo-kidney-cell-culture.
by then many-common-cold-viruses could be grown in either of these-cell-cultures and were accordingly classified as m-or-h-strain.
during 1960-1961,  david-arthur-john-tyrrell's-team collected throat-swabs from 170-school-boys having common-cold at a-boarding-school in epsom, surrey.
among few-samples that could not be cultured in any of the-culture-media, a-specimen-designated-b814, collected on 17-february 1961, was particularly infectious among healthy-volunteers.
there was no-evidence whether the-pathogen in b814 was a-bacterium or a-virus as all-bacterial-and-viral-culture-methods available showed negative-results.
the-pathogen in b814 could only be maintained in human-tracheal-culture and experimentally passed on to healthy-volunteers by nasal-inoculation.
in 1965, healthy-volunteers were able to confirm that the-pathogen in b814 was a-filter-passing-virus, susceptible to ether-treatment (indicating a-lipid-envelope of the-virus), able to induce cold in antibiotic-treated-volunteers (indicating the-pathogen in b814 was not a-bacterium), and cultured in human-embryo-trachea-epithelial-cell-culture.
serological-tests (antigen-antibody-reactions) further indicated that the-virus was not related (not reactive) to antibodies (serotypes) of any-known-viruses at the-time.
reporting in the-british-medical-journal, tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe wrote tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe conclusion as:after considerable-initial-doubts we now believe that the-b814-strain is a-virus virtually unrelated to any-other-known-virus of the-human-respiratory-tract, although, since it is ether-labile, it may be a-myxovirus.
but tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe contradicted tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe regarding the-identity of the-virus as tyrrell and malcolm-l.-bynoe mentioned in the-experimental-results, saying:the-virus was concluded that b814 did not belong to any of the-serotypes of myxovirus used, but might be distantly related to influenza-c-or-sendai-viruses.
in an-independent-research in us, dorothy-hamre and john-j.-procknow studied respiratory-tract-infection among medical-students at the-university of chicago.
in 1962, dorothy-hamre and john-j.-procknow obtained five-samples that were associated with very-different-symptoms, causing mild-cold only, and could be cultured only in secondary-human-kidney-tissue in contrast to other-cold-viruses which could be maintained in monkey-embryo-kidney-cell-culture.
serological-test indicated they were not myxoviruses (orthomyxoviridae).
they presented they discovery as "a-new-virus isolated from the-human-respiratory-tract" in the-proceedings of the-society for experimental-biology and medicine in 1966.
they further studied one-sample, designated 229e, grown in human-diploid-cell-culture (wi-38) and described one-sample, designated 229e, grown in human-diploid-cell-culture (wi-38)
developmental-stages using transmission-electron-microscopy to show that one-sample, designated 229e, grown in human-diploid-cell-culture (wi-38) was new-type of virus.
discovery of the-structure ==
viruses cannot be seen normally with light-microscopes.
viruses was only with the-development of electron-microscopy that viruses could be visualised and structurally elucidated.
reginald-l.-reagan, jean-e.-hauser, mary-g.-lillie, and arthur-h.-craige-jr. of the-university of maryland were the first to describe the-structure of coronavirus using the-transmission-electron-microscopy.
in 1948, reginald-l.-reagan, jean-e.-hauser, mary-g.-lillie, and arthur-h.-craige-jr. of the-university of maryland reported in the-cornell-veterinarian that ibv was spherical in shape and some of reginald-l.-reagan, jean-e.-hauser, mary-g.-lillie, and arthur-h.-craige-jr. of the-university of maryland had filamentous-projections.
but the-images were difficult to interpret due to poor-resolution and low-magnification (at × 28,000).
their-subsequent-studies did not show any-striking-properties from other-viruses.
an-important-advancement was made by charles-henry-domermuth and o.f.-edwards at the-university of kentucky in 1957 when charles-henry-domermuth and o.f.-edwards observed ibvs as "ring-or-doughnut-shaped-structures."
d.m.-berry at the-glaxo-laboratories, middlesex, uk, with j.g.-cruickshank, h.p.-chu and r.j.h.-wells at the-university of cambridge published a-more-comprehensive-and-better-electron-microscopic-images in 1964.
four-strains of ibv, including beaudette-strain, were compared with influenza-virus, with which they share most-resemblance.
in contrast to influenza-virus in which the-projections were small and straight, all-ibv-strains had "pear-shaped-projections", which were names the-"spikes" and described as:these-“spikes” were often seen over part of the-surface only and were less densely packed than those seen in influenza-viruses.
they varied considerably in shape.
commonly they appeared to be attached to the-virus by a-very-narrow-neck and to thicken towards they distal ends, sometimes forming a-bulbous-mass-90-110-å in diameter.
j.-f.-david-ferreira and r.-a.-manaker from the-national-cancer-institute, bethesda, were the first to study the-structure of mhv in 1965.
j.-f.-david-ferreira and r.-a.-manaker from the-national-cancer-institute, bethesda also observed the-surface-projections as on ibv, stating, "the-outer-surface of the-particle is covered by 'spicules'.
in 1966, tyrrell sought the-help of anthony-peter-waterson at the-st-thomas's-hospital-medical-school in london who had recruited june-dalziel-almeida as an-electron-microscopist.
almeida had studied ibv and mhv finding ibv and mhv as structurally-distinct-viruses, but  almeida manuscript was rejected upon a-referee's-decision that the-microscopic-images were of influenza-virus and lacked novelty.
tyrrell supplied the-human-virus-samples from which it was possible to ascertain the-viral-structure.
almeida and tyrrell published almeida and tyrrell findings in the-april-1967-issue of the-journal of general-virology, in which almeida and tyrrell concluded:probably the-most-interesting-finding from these-experiments was that two-human-respiratory-viruses, 229-e and b814 are morphologically identical with avian-infectious-bronchitis.
two-human-respiratory-viruses, 229-e and b814 are morphologically identical with avian-infectious-bronchitis-biological-properties, as far as two-human-respiratory-viruses, 229-e and b814 are morphologically identical with avian-infectious-bronchitis are known, are consistent with this.
both-the-human-viruses are ether sensitive as is avian-infectious-bronchitis
229-e, have a-similar-size by filtration and multiply in the-presence of an-inhibitor of dna-synthesis.
in 1967, kenneth-mcintosh and co-workers at the-national-institute of health, bethesda, reported the-structure of common-cold-viruses kenneth-mcintosh and co-workers at the-national-institute of health, bethesda collected from fellow-workers during 1965-1966.
kenneth-mcintosh and co-workers at the-national-institute of health, bethesda found six of kenneth-mcintosh and co-workers at the-national-institute of health, bethesda samples had common-characters with b814.
two-samples (designated oc38 and oc43, as the-number of specimen in organ-culture) were particularly virulent and caused encephalitis in experimental-mice.
two-samples (designated oc38 and oc43, as the-number of specimen in organ-culture) compared the-structure of one of two-samples (designated oc38 and oc43, as the-number of specimen in organ-culture) samples numbered 501 (oc43 ) with those of 229e, ibv and influenza-virus.
it was so identical to ibv that they called the-human-viruses as "ibv-like viruses".
they made a-definitive-description as:all-"ibv-like"-viruses, 229e, and ibv show the-following-characteristics: (1)-an-over-all-diameter of 160 mμ with a-variation of ± 440 mμ; (2)-a-moderate-pleomorphism with resultant-elliptical,-round,-or-tear-drop-shapes but no filamentous or "tailed"-forms;
(3)-characteristic-spikes
20 mμ long, usually club- or pear-shaped narrow at the-base and 10 mμ wide at the-outer-edge, spaced widely apart and distributed fairly uniformly about the-circumference of the-particle.
invention of the-name and history of the-taxonomy ==
by mid-1967  by mid-1967 was recognised that ibv, mhv, b814 and 229e were structurally and biologically similar so that ibv, mhv, b814 and 229e form a-distinct-group.
tyrrell met waterson and almeida in london to decide on the-name of the-viruses.
almeida had earlier suggested the-term "influenza-like" because of their-resemblance, but tyrrell thought it inappropriate.
almeida came up with a-novel-name-"coronavirus".
tyrrell wrote of tyrrell recollection in cold-wars:
the-fight against the-common-cold in 2002:
even though we could only base we judgement on the-electron-microscope-images we were quite certain that we had identified a-previously-unrecognised-group of viruses.
so what should we call we had identified a-previously-unrecognised-group of viruses? '
influenza-like' seem a bit feeble, somewhat vague, and probably misleading.
we looked more closely at the-appearance of the-new-viruses and noticed that they had a-kind of halo surrounding they.
recourse to a-dictionary produced the-latin-equivalent, corona, and
so the-name-coronavirus was born.
proposal of the-new-name was submitted to and accepted by the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses (icnv, established in 1966).
16-november-1968-issue of nature reported the-justification by almeida, berry, c.h.-cunningham, hamre, m.s.-hofstad, l.-mallucci, mcintosh and tyrrell as:particles [of ibv] are more or less rounded in profile; although there is a-certain-amount of polymorphism, there is also a-characteristic-"fringe" of projections 200 å long, which are rounded or petal shaped, rather than sharp or pointed, as in the-myxoviruses.
this-appearance, recalling the-solar-corona, is shared by mouse-hepatitis-virus and several-viruses recently recovered from man, namely-strain-b814, 229e and several-others...
in the-opinion of the-eight-virologists these-viruses are members of a-previously-unrecognized-group which these-viruses suggest should be called the coronaviruses, to recall the-characteristic-appearance by which these-viruses are identified in the-electron-microscope.
coronavirus was accepted as a-genus-name by icnv in coronavirus first-report in 1971.
ibv was then officially designated the-type-species as avian-infectious-bronchitis-virus (but renamed to coronavirus in 2009).
mouse-hepatitis-virus approved in 1971 was merged with rat-coronavirus (discovered in 1970) as murine-coronavirus in 2009.
229e and oc43 were collectively named human respiratory virus but merged as human-coronavirus 229e (hcov-229e) in 2009.
the-first-discovered-human-coronavirus-b814 was antigenically different from 229e and oc43, but  the-first-discovered-human-coronavirus-b814 could not be propagated in culture and was exhausted during experiments in 1968, thus, was excluded in taxonomy.
coroniviridae was adopted as the-family-name in the-icnv (soon after renamed international committee on taxonomy of viruses, ictv)
second-report in 1975.229e and oc43 were together named human respiratory virus in the-icnv-first-report.
the-species was split into the-genus-coronavirus 229e
(hcov-oc229e) and
human-coronavirus-oc43 (hcov-oc43) in 1995.
while hcov-oc229e is retained as a-valid-species, hcov-oc43 was merged with porcine-hemagglutinating-encephalomyelitis-virus (discovered in 1962), bovine coronavirus  (discovered in 1973), human-enteric-coronavirus (discovered in 1975), equine-coronavirus (discovered in 2000) and canine-respiratory-coronavirus (discovered in 2003) into a-single-species betacoronavirus 1 in 2009.owing to increasing-number and diversity of new-species discovered, ctv split the-genus-coronavirus in 2009 into four-genera, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, deltacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus.
as of 2020, there are 39-species of coronaviruses under the-family-coronaviridae.
there are 7-human-coronaviruses while 32-species are those of pigs, dogs, cats, rodents, cows, horses, camels, beluga-whales, birds and bats.
other-human-coronaviruses == ===
human-coronavirus
hcov-nl63) ==
hcov-nl63 was discovered in january 2003 from a-seven-month-old-baby in amsterdam, the-netherlands.
the-baby was suffering from bronchiolitis, coryza, conjunctivitis and fever.
a year later, a-comprehensive-analysis of nasal-swab-samples was done from where a-comprehensive-analysis of nasal-swab-samples was found that a-sample from an-eight-month-old-boy diagnosed in 1988 with pneumonia had a-similar-virus (hcov-nl).
a-similar-virus (hcov-nl) was independently described in 2005 as hcov-nh following a-discovery among a-group of children having respiratory-infection in new-haven, connecticut, us.
the-origin of a-similar-virus (hcov-nl) remains a-mystery, but the-origin of the-virus is closely related to tricolored bat (perimyotis-subflavus) coronavirus and can survive in bat-cell-lines, suggesting that tricolored bat (perimyotis-subflavus) coronavirus is derived from animals (zoonotic).
human-coronavirus hku1 (hcov-hku1) ===
hcov-hku1 was discovered from a-71-year-old-man in hong-kong, china, who was suffering from pneumonia in january 2004.
when samples (nasopharyngeal-aspirates from pneumonia-patients) collected between april 2004 to march 2005 were analysed in 2006, hcov-hku1 was found that 13-individuals had hcov-hku1.
the same year, the-virus was subsequently reported from australia, europe, and us.
zoonotic-coronaviruses ===
coronaviruses that are transmitted from animals (zoonoses) are clinically the-most-important-human-coronaviruses as coronaviruses that are transmitted from animals (zoonoses) are responsible for a-series of global-epidemics.
there are two-species of such-coronaviruses: ==== 1.
severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus ====
two-distinct-viruses are known under this-species, namely-sars-cov and sars-cov-2.
sars-cov emerged as an-acute-respiratory-syndrome in guangdong-province, southern-china, during 16-november 2002 to 28-february 2003.
an-acute-respiratory-syndrome in guangdong-province, southern-china was accompanied by pneumonia that was fatal in many-cases.
an-acute-respiratory-syndrome in guangdong-province, southern-china was believed to have been contained in china, but an-infected-individual carried an-acute-respiratory-syndrome in guangdong-province, southern-china to hong-kong on 21-february and spread an-acute-respiratory-syndrome in guangdong-province, southern-china in the-hospital.
the-first-clinical-case outside china was reported on 26-february 2003 in hanoi, viet-nam.
it rapidly spread to southeast-asia, north-america and europe.
the-world-health-organization (who) notified an-epidemic-alert on 6-march 2003, referring to the-disease as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome.
the-disease as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome was identified as a-novel-coronavirus from hong-kong in april, from toronto in may, and at the-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) in us in may.
in october, the-samples from guangdong were established as the-prototype-specimens, and the-name sars-coronavirus (sars-cov) was introduced.
ictv approved the-name sars-coronavirus (sars-cov) as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus in 2004, and renamed the-name sars-coronavirus (sars-cov)
severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus in 2009.
by mid-july 2003, the-infection subsided, and by then the-infection had spread to 28-countries infecting 8096-people and causing 774-deaths.
in october, the-infection was found that the-infection was acquired from the-masked-palm-civets (paguma-larvata) from a-live-animal-market in guangdong.
further-studies in 2005 showed that civets were the-intermediate-reservoirs of the-virus, and horseshoe-bats (rhinilophus-species) were the-natural-hosts.
infection with sars-cov-2 was known from cases of atypical-pneumonia in wuhan, china.
the-wuhan-municipal-health-commission reported 27-individuals having "viral-pneumonia" on 31-december 2019.
the-first-known-case was recorded on 12-december.
the-first-known-case was in thailand on 13-january.
who adopted the-name of the-disease as "coronavirus-disease 2019" (covid-19) on 11-february 2020, and used "2019-novel-coronavirus" or "2019-ncov" for the-virus.
on 2-march 2020, ictv published the-formal-description and gave the-official-name as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2).
who declared the-infection as pandemic on 11-march, and since then has spread to more-than-192-countries and territories, affecting over-149-million-people and resulting resulting in more-than-3.15-million-deaths.
the-origin of the-virus is not known.
malayan-pangolins (manis-javanica) which are available in the-live-animal-market in wuhan-city has been studied as a-probable-source as the-virus is closely related to the-pangolin-coronavirus.
genetic-evidence that the-virus bears 93%-nucleotide-similarity with a-novel-coronavirus of malayan-horseshoe-bat (rhinolophus malayanus), and 96%-identity with bat-sars-like-coronavirus ratg13 of intermediate-horseshoe-bat (r.-affinis) indicates that bat-sars-like-coronavirus ratg13 of intermediate-horseshoe-bat (r.-affinis) probably originated in bats.
middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus ====
in april 2012, the-ministry of health, jordan, reported an-outbreak of acute-respiratory-illness affecting 11-people at a-hospital in zarqa.
on 13-june 2012, a-60-year-old-man having the-symptoms was admitted to dr.-soliman-fakeeh-hospital in jeddah, saudi-arabia.
a-60-year-old-man having the-symptoms was diagnosed with acute-pneumonia and died on 24-june due to progressive-respiratory-and-renal-failure.
a-60-year-old-man having the-symptoms-sputum-sample showed the-presence of coronavirus very similar to bat coronaviruses-hku4 and hku5.
progressive-respiratory-and-renal-failure was named hcov-emc (after erasmus-medical-center in rotterdam, the-netherlands, where progressive-respiratory-and-renal-failure was identified).
retrospective-study of samples from the-jordan-hospital revealed that the-diseases and the-virus were similar.
who referred to the-virus as the-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus (mers-cov) on 23-may 2013.
ictv announced the-name as middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus on 15-may 2013.
in 2013, a-study revealed that the-virus was 100% genetically identical to the-coronavirus of the-egyptian-tomb-bat (taphozous perforatus coronavirus hku4) from bisha, saudi-arabia, indicating (taphozous-perforatus-coronavirus-hku4)-origin.
in 2014, (taphozous-perforatus-coronavirus-hku4) was established that the-virus was transmitted to humans by dromedary-camels, which act as the-intermediate-hosts.
by december 2019, the-infection was confirmed in 2,499-individuals with 858-deaths (34·3%-mortality) from 27-countries covering all-continents.
other-animal-coronaviruses == ===
feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus ===
a-viral-infection in pigs, called transmissible gastroenteritis, which was characterised mainly by diarrhoea and vomiting, and associated with high-mortality was first recognised by leo-p.-doyle and l.-m.-hutchings in 1946.
a.-w.-mcclurkin isolated and identified the-virus in 1965.
the-virus was named transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine in the-icnv-first-report, and changed to porcine-transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus (ptgv) in the-second-report in 1976.
a-new-disease that caused inflammation of the-abdomen (peritonitis) in cats was reported in 1966, the-virus was identified in 1968, and was named by ictv in 1991 as feline-infectious-peritonitis-virus.
in 1974 a-new-coronavirus was discovered from us-military-dogs, and was named by ictv in 1991 as canine-coronavirus.
as the-molecular-and-antigenic-relationship of the-three-viruses were later established, ictv merged the-three-viruses into alphacoronavirus 1 in 2009.
porcine-epidemic-diarrhea-virus ===
an-acute-infectious-diarrhoea was first known in england in 1971.
an-acute-infectious-diarrhoea was specifically among fattening pigs and sows.
it was referred to as too (for "the other one") or tge2 (for "transmissible-gastroenteritis-type 2") as the-symptoms were similar to transmissible-gastroenteritis.
other than causing rapid-and-acute-diarrhoea, it was not a-fatal-disease.
the-case was first reported by j.-oldham in pig-farming in 1972 using the-term-"epidemic-diarrhea".
a-second-outbreak occurred in 1976, and was called "porcine epidemic diarrhoea. "
it eventually spread throughout europe.
m.-b.-pensaert and p.-de-bouck at the-university of gent, begium isolated and identified the-new-coronavirus in 1978, and designated the-new-coronavirus cv777.
the-new-coronavirus eventually spread throughout europe.
ictv named the-virus-porcine-epidemic-diarrhea-virus in 1995.
an-epidemic broke out from china in 2010 that spread throughout the-world.
a-virulent-strain emerged in us between 2013 and 2015.
a-virulent-strain affected pigs of all-ages, and mortality was as high as 95% among the-suckling-piglets.
another-severe-outbreak occurred in germany in 2014 that spread to other-european-countries.
bat-coronaviruses ===
reagan-and-reagan-colleagues at the-university of maryland were the first to investigate bats as a-potential-sources of coronavirus in 1956.
bats experimentally inoculated 44-cave-bats or little-brown-bats (myotis lucifugus) with ibv and found that all of bats developed the-symptoms of infectious-bronchitis.
bats report reads:50-percent of the-bats exposed to the-infectious-bronchitis-virus showed symptoms or death in the-intracerebral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, intracardiac and intraocular-groups; 75 percent in the-intranasal-and-intrarectal-groups; 100 percent in the-intraoral-group; and 25 percent intralingual and intramuscular group, whereas the-controls appeared normal.
but nothing was known of the-real-nature of bats as reservoirs of coronaviruses until the-epidemic of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome of humans in 2002/2003.
since the-identification of sars-cov was identified in the early 2003, and horseshoe bats as the-identification of sars-cov natural hosts in 2005, bats have been extensively studied.
among all-coronavirus-hosts, bats are known to harbour the-most-variety, with more-than-30-species identified.
according to diversity-estimate, there may be 3,200-species of coronaviruses in bats.
evolutionary-history ==
according to phylogenetic-estimate all-coronaviruses evolved from the-most-recent-common-ancestor that lived around 190 to 489 (with a-mean of 293) million years ago.
the-four-genera split up around 2,400 to 3,300 years ago into bat and avian-coronavirus-ancestors.
bat-coronavirus gave rise to species of alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus that infect mammals, while avian-coronavirus produced those of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus that infect birds.
zoonotic-coronaviruses emerged recently.
for instance, sars-cov was transmitted from bats in 1998 (4.08 years prior to the-outbreak), and diverged from bat-coronavirus in around 1962.
sars-cov-2 evolved from bat-coronavirus in around 1948.

the-covid-19-pandemic in ontario is an-ongoing-viral-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), a-novel-infectious-disease caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-first-confirmed-case of covid-19 in canada was announced on january 25, 2020, involving a-traveller who had recently returned to toronto from travel in china, including wuhan.
ontario has had the-largest-number of confirmed-covid-19-cases among canada's-provinces and territories, but due to having the-largest-population, only ranks fourth adjusted per capita.
timeline ==
a-state of emergency was declared by premier-doug-ford on march 17, 2020 as a-result of increasing transmission province-wide.
this included the-gradual-implementation of restrictions on gatherings and commerce.
on april 3, 2020, the-province released modelling projecting that over the-full-course of the-pandemic, 100,000-deaths would occur in ontario with no-public-health-measures and 3,000–15,000-deaths would likely occur with public-health-measures.
from late-spring to early-summer, the-majority of the-deaths were residents of long-term-care-homes.
in late-april 2020, one out of five of all-long-term-care-homes in ontario had an-outbreak and 70% to 80% of all-covid-19-deaths had been in retirement and long-term-care-homes.
following medical-assistance and observation by the-canadian-armed-forces, the-military released a-report detailing "a-number of medical,-professional-and-technical-issues" amongst 'for-profit' long-term-care homes including neglect, lack of equipment and allegations of elder-abuse.
from may through august 2020, the-province instituted a-three-stage-plan to lift economic-restrictions, subject to the-employment of social-distancing and other-guidelines, and continued-restrictions on the-sizes of gatherings.
the-state of emergency was lifted on july 24, 2020.
a-plan was implemented for the-return-to-class of public-schools, involving more-than-2-million-children.
in early-september 2020, ontario showed a-significant-increase in new-cases, along with similar-spikes in provinces across the-country.
ontario began to reintroduce some-restrictions, initially and particularly in the-hotspots of toronto, peel-region, york-region and ottawa.
in early-november, ontario unveiled a-new-five-tiered-colour-coded-"response-framework".
the-framework was created initially in contradiction to the-metrics suggested to political-officials by public-health-ontario and later amended by the-province to lower thresholds in each-category.
from late-november to mid-december 2020, the-province began placing regions in rolling-lockdowns, culminating in a-province-wide-shutdown beginning boxing-day.

indoor-social-gatherings that involve people from outside of one's-immediate-household are prohibited.
outdoor-gatherings are limited to 10-people with social-distancing.
all-non-essential-businesses, retail-outlets (which include all-businesses deemed non-essential under the-"lockdown"-tier of the-response-framework, as well as hardware-stores and pet-shops), cultural-amenities, sports-and-recreation-facilities (unless "being used by high-performance-athletes and specified professional-leagues"), and personal-care-services must close to the-public.

stricter-province-wide-measures upgraded the-provincewide-shutdown to a stay-at-home order; all-ontario-residents were required to remain at all-ontario-residents homes unless conducting an-activity deemed essential.
essential-activities include shopping at grocery-stores or pharmacies, receiving health-care, exercise, or conducing essential-work that cannot be performed remotely.
all-employees were required to work from home if  all-employees have the-capability of doing so.
the-province states that what is considered "essential work" is based on "[the]-best-judgement and common-sense of employers".
performing arts-facilities were required to cease all-operations, even for virtual-streaming-concerts.
all-other-restrictions enacted under provincewide-shutdown remained in force, and the-colour-coded-response-framework was officially considered "paused" due to the-declaration of emergency.
certain-businesses, such as liquor-stores, hardware-stores, and stores offering delivery-or-curbside-pickup-services, were required to close from 8-p.m. to 7 a.m. nightly.

outdoor-gatherings were limited to five-people, and guidance now recommends masks be worn outside (in addition to the-existing-indoor-mandate) if social-distancing is not possible.

premier-ford stated plans for a-compliance-"blitz" of retail-store-inspections beginning the-weekend of january 15.
results of the-inspection-"blitz" revealed 36-of-110-stores visited in violation of covid-19-measures, or 70%-compliance-rate.
the-measures faced criticism for disproportionately favouring big-box-retailers, by not restricting the-times of day in which they may offer curbside-pickup-or-delivery-services, or preventing they from selling non-essential-goods.
the-measures also does not include funding to cover paid sick-leave for essential-and-low-wage-workers.
on february 8, 2021, premier-ford announced that the-declaration of emergency would expire, but that the stay-at-home order would be extended in the-majority of health-regions to allow a-gradual-reinstatement of the-response-framework.
the stay-at-home order was first lifted on february 10 in eastern-ontario's-hastings-prince-edward-public-health-unit, the-kingston, frontenac and lennox & addington-health-unit, and the-renfrew-county-and-district-health-unit.
the stay-at-home order was expected to be lifted in most of eastern-ontario's on february 16, excluding peel, toronto, and york (expected to occur on february 22), and any-other-area where the-province believes the-province is not yet safe to lift the stay-at-home order.
this was later amended to exclude york and include north-bay-parry-sound.
even as the-restriction is lifted, the-province still encourages residents to stay at home whenever possible, and discourages social-gatherings and non-essential-travel (including travel between regions with different-levels on the-response-framework).
on february 19, 2021, york-region was announced to be moving to red (control) on february 22 while toronto, peel and north-bay-parry-sound were to remain in a stay-at-home order until at-least-march 8.

regional-advisory-system === ==== use during the-second-wave from november 7 – december 26, 2020 ====
on november 3, 2020, premier-ford stated that future-modifications of restrictions during the-second-wave will be performed regionally using a-colour-coded-"response-framework".
a-colour-coded-"response-framework" went into place on november 7.on november 11, a-colour-coded-"response-framework" was reported by the-toronto-star that the-ford-government had allegedly ignored recommendations by public-health-ontario regarding the-metrics used for the-advisory-system — which were four times narrower than what was actually implemented by the-ford-government.
two days later, premier-ford announced that the-thresholds for each-level would be decreased: for example, the-criteria for the-"control"-(red)-level was reduced from a-weekly-incidence-rate of 100-or-more-per-capita, to 40 or more.
regions included in each-tier were adjusted to match the-new-thresholds effective november 16.
premier-ford stated that the-original-criteria was based on earlier-models that had anticipated only-950–1,250-new-cases per day by the-time premier-ford was implemented and that premier-ford would not have used them if case-numbers had reached the-point them had on november 10.
use during the-third-wave beginning february 8, 2021 ====
due to the-declaration of emergency and a stay-at-home order issued, the-response-framework was officially considered paused from december 26, 2020 to february 9, 2021.
on february 8, 2021, premier-ford announced that the-response-framework would be gradually reinstated to replace the stay-at-home order, beginning with the-hastings-prince-edward-public-health-unit, the-kingston, frontenac and lennox & addington-health-unit, and the-renfrew-county-and-district-health-unit on february 10 (which reopened into the-"prevent"-tier).
unlike the-earlier-revision, the-"lockdown"-tier will allow for non-essential-retail with capacity-limits (unless the-region is subject to a stay-at-home
order).the-framework is now subject to an-emergency-brake, where regions may immediately be placed back in the-"lockdown"-tier as a-circuit-breaker if health-officials believe that the-incidence-rate is increasing too rapidly and the-healthcare-system is at a-severe-risk of being overwhelmed.
as of march 26, health-officials may impose a-stricter-lockdown (equivalent to the-earlier-provincewide-shutdown) under the-emergency-brake as well.
on march 20, further-amendments to the-response-framework were implemented for restaurants; outdoor-dining is now permitted in regions in the-"lockdown"-tier, and capacity-limits for restaurants in the-"control" and "restrict" tiers were increased from 10-and-50-customers respectively to 50-and-100,-or-50%-capacity, whichever is lower.
additional-modifications were announced on march 26; as of march 29, the-"lockdown"-category began to allow outdoor-fitness-classes of up-to-10-people.
personal-care-services were to be allowed operate by-appointment
only at 25% capacity/5-people (whichever is fewer) in "lockdown"-regions beginning april 12.
in addition, subject to physical-distancing, capacity-limits were removed for outdoor-religious-services (including funerals and weddings) in all-regions.

second-provincewide-shutdown and stay-at-home order (april 3 – may 20, 2021) ===
on april 1, 2021, amid rising-new-infections, particularly exacerbated by variants of concern and preceding the-easter-weekend, premier-ford announced a-second-province-wide-shutdown beginning april 3.
all-regions were moved to a-new-sixth-level of the-response-framework, "shutdown" (white), re-imposing-measures that were introduced during the-first-provincewide-shutdown.
this includes prohibiting all-indoor-organized-events and gatherings, limiting outdoor-gatherings to five-people, capacity limits for retail (50% for essential-retail, 25% for all-other-stores), and ordering the-closure of all in-person dining (regardless of setting), daycamps, personal care services, sports and recreation facilities, meeting and event spaces, and cinemas, and capping capacity of religious-services to 15%.
all performing arts-facilities must close, even for internet-streaming-events.
the-response-framework is paused.
premier-ford faced criticism over the-new-shutdown (which resulted in only-minor-changes for health-regions already in the-"lockdown"-tier), with leader of the-opposition andrea horwath arguing that it was "a-too-little-too-late-response by this-government to what we knew was coming".
on april 4, the-medical-officers of ottawa, peel-region, and toronto sent a-letter to the-government requesting that a stay-at-home order be issued.
on april 7, 2021, premier-ford declared a-third-state of emergency and announced that a second stay-at-home order will take effect at 12:01-a.m.-et on april 8, and last for four-weeks.
all-ontario-residents must remain at all-ontario-residents homes unless conducting an-activity deemed essential.
essential-activities include shopping at grocery-stores or pharmacies, receiving health-care, exercise, school, or conducting essential-work that cannot be performed remotely.
all-employees must work from home if all-employees have the-capability of doing so.
ford explained that "the-situation is evolving rapidly, hour by hour.
and as things change, as we learn more about these-deadly-new-variants, as we see new-problems arise, we need to adapt.
we need to move quickly and decisively.
and right now, above all else, we plan is to get needles in the-arms and protect we hospitals. "
shutdown-restrictions and all-other-restrictions from the previous stay-at-home order apply.
furthermore, essential-retail-stores are only allowed to sell food, pharmacy-items, and cleaning supplies, and all-other-non-essential-goods are prohibited from being displayed or sold to in-store customers.
in addition, retailers of assistive-devices, automotive-and-equipment-rental-services, motor-vehicle and boat-dealers, vehicle-and-equipment-repair-services, prescription-eyewear, safety-supplies, and telecom-services may operate at 25%-capacity by appointment only.
following criticism of photos showing displays of cloth-masks blocked by local-walmart-stores, representatives of the-government clarified that representatives of the-government were considered an essential good.
the-order does not include paid sick-leave; premier-ford accused those advocating for paid sick-leave of "playing politics", and not directing people to the-canadian-recovery-sickness-benefit (crsb)
instead (which is a-retroactive-payment), which a-retroactive-payment) deemed sufficient.
extension of the stay-at-home order and further-restrictions ====
on april 16, premier-ford announced that due to record high-hospitalizations and cases, the stay-at-home order had been extended through at-least-may 20, and that several-additional-restrictions will also be imposed.
effective april 17, outdoor-gatherings with anyone from outside of the-immediate-household are prohibited, all-outdoor-recreation-amenities must close,-allowable-"big-box"-retail-stores are restricted to 25%-capacity, and all-non-essential-construction-projects must be suspended.
beginning april 19, land-travel into ontario is restricted at the-provincial-border to essential-purposes (transport of goods, medical-care, work, and exercising treaty-rights) only, and indoor-places of worship
are limited to 10-people.
furthermore, solicitor-general-sylvia-jones announced that police would receive enhanced-authority to enforce the stay-at-home order, including being able to perform random-stops of individuals
police-suspect are travelling in violation of the stay-at-home order.
police would receive enhanced-authority to enforce the stay-at-home order, including being able to perform random-stops of individuals they suspect could compel individuals to state police would receive enhanced-authority to enforce the stay-at-home order, including being able to perform random-stops of individuals they suspect home-address and purpose of travel; failure to comply with a-request for this-information would be a-ticketable-offence.
premier-ford stated that "i have never shied away from telling you the-brutal-honest-truth, never shied away from tough-decisions and today i am here to do just that.
my friends we are losing the-battle between variants and vaccines", and that "we need to step up enforcement and we need to focus on those who are deliberately putting others at risk by ignoring the stay-at-home order.
"the-new-measures faced criticism; the-province did not introduce paid sick-leave, the-new-police-authority was criticized for resembling carding and having a-disproportionate-impact to bipoc-communities, while a-number of municipal-police-departments announced that a-number of municipal-police-departments would not perform random-stops under the-measure.
on april 17, jones announced that the-new-police-authority would be narrowed to only allow a-number of municipal-police-departments to stop and ticket individuals
a-number of municipal-police-departments suspect are participating in a-public-event or social-gathering.
despite the-changes, the-revised-measures elicited continued-concerns.
also amid criticism, the-province backpedaled on restricting playgrounds as part of the-prohibition of outdoor-recreation.
on april 20, peel-public-health issued a-section-22-order effective april 23, requiring any-business that has been linked to five or more
covid-19-infections within the-past-14-days to shut down for 10-days.
all-employees of the-business must self-isolate for the-duration, and it is "strongly recommended" that impacted employees be provided with paid-leave.
peel-public-health stated that "workplace-exposures in peel-region continue to drive peel-region high case counts of covid-19.
expedited-closure will also allow peel-public-health to investigate workplace-exposures without risk of continued spread.
" this-order will not apply to healthcare, schools, or other-"critical-infrastructure".
toronto-public-health subsequently issued a-nearly-identical-order.
on april 22, in his-first-public-appearance since april 16, and while self-isolating due to being a-close-contact of a-positive-case within his-staff, premier-ford admitted that the-new-enforcement-measures announced last friday "went too far".
premier-ford also announced that ontario was working on developing a-paid-sick-leave-benefit, arguing that they needed to fill "gaps" in the-crsb that were not fulfilled by the-2021-federal-budget, and that they planned to make it "the best program in north-america".
vaccines == ===
timeline of rollout === ====
early-rollout ====
on december 9, 2020, health-canada approved the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine.
vaccines were distributed amongst the-provinces by the-federal-government.
ontario received an-initial-delivery of 6,000-doses of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine to be received before the-end of 2020.
on december 14, the-first-vaccination was delivered in ontario in toronto, kicking off a-vaccination-rollout.
vaccinations began december 14, 2020 in a-pilot-program to vaccinate health-care-workers working in long-term-care-homes and later expanded to front-line health-care-workers.
ontario's-vaccination-task-force later announced ontario's-vaccination-task-force plan to inoculate all-long-term-care-home-residents and staff in toronto, peel, york and windsor-essex with a-goal-date of january 21, 2021.
the-government expanded this to all-long-term-care-home-residents in the-province by february 15.on december 23, 2020, health-canada approved the-mrna-1273-covid-19-vaccine developed by moderna.
the-first-tranche of vaccines of a total 53,000 designated for ontario by the-end of 2020 arrived at toronto-pearson-international-airport on december 24.over
the christmas and holiday season, many-vaccination-clinics were paused.
the-ontario-government has been criticized for this-delay,  the-ontario-government officially responded that the-cessation was due to staff-shortages.
rick-hillier, in charge of the-ontario-vaccine-task-force later apologized, calling the-cessation a "mistake".
on december 29, 2020, rick-hillier, in charge of the-ontario-vaccine-task-force added that the-task-force was looking into applying single-doses of the-moderna-vaccine in order to inoculate even-more-people more efficiently.
on january 15, 2021 it was announced all-ltc-homes in toronto had been vaccinated.
on january 19, 2021,  the-ontario-government announced all-ltc-residents and staff in hot-zones had received at least all-ltc-residents and staff in hot-zones first dose.
by february 14, 2021
the-province announced the-province had completed at-least-first-dose-vaccinations in all-long-term-care-homes in ontario.
manufacturing-delays ===
due to manufacturing-delays with pfizer (aimed at retooling in order to speed up vaccine-production), ontario received a-significant-decline in vaccine-delivery between late-january and early-february.
on january 29, 2021 another-delay was announced with moderna, who announced that a 20–25 percent cut in product would be delivered to canada for the-month of february.
on january 28, 2021, the-ontario-government announced a-major-miscalculation in reported-fully-vaccinated-people, over-reporting the-number of fully-vaccinated-individuals.
regular-shipments and approval of new-vaccines ===
by late-february 2021, shipments for both-pfizer and moderna increased significantly.
on february 26, 2021 the-oxford–astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine was approved for use by health-canada and on march 5, 2021, the-oxford–astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine was approved for use by health-canadahealth-canada.
the-johnson & johnson
the-johnson & johnson only requires one-shot for administration.
shipments of the-oxford–
astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine arrived in the-province on march 3, 2021.
the-government announced the-creation of a-pilot-programme for administration through ontario-pharmacies to begin march 9, 2021.
the-creation of a-pilot-programme for administration through ontario-pharmacies would originally only be used on those between the-ages of 60–64 due to a-lack of study on the-oxford–astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine's-efficacy on adults over 65.
the-pilot will take place in 380-pharmacies in toronto, kingston and windsor-essex.
the-first-shot of oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine was given march 10 in toronto.
registration began in the-three-regions at shoppers-drug-mart, rexall and costco-pharmacies.
the-province announced another-pilot-programme involving family-doctors administering oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine beginning march 13, 2021 in six-regions including: hamilton, toronto, wellington-dufferin-guelph, peterborough, simcoe-muskoka and peel region.
on march 22, 2021
the-province was announced restaurant-workers (mostly-young-individuals) would be prioritized in phase 2 of the-provincial-vaccine-rollout.
in anticipation for moving into phase 2 of the-vaccine-rollout in the-province, vaccination-appointments for older-citizens in late-march 2021 were hard to fill, partly due to vaccine-hesitancy in older-populations, and the-online-spread of misinformation by older-populations.
misinformation was exacerbated by naci's-opinion-reversal on the-safety of the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine and the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine potential side-effects of blood-clots in post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic-events.
due to recommendations from naci, on march 29, 2021 ontario later restricted use of astrazeneca to those-adults aged 55+.
transition to phase 2 ====
following the-departure of general-rick-hillier as the-chair of the-vaccine-task-force on march 31, 2021, general-rick-hillier was replaced by doctor-homer-tien (head of ornge and a-trauma surgeon).with a-steady-influx of vaccine-shipments, the-province began to open up eligibility, especially in the-gta.
ontario officially moved to phase 2 of ontario vaccine rollout strategy on april 6, 2021.
the first of these-province-wide-announcements included vaccinating adults with high-risk-health-conditions.
following a-sharp-rise in new-cases, exacerbated by covid-19-variants, the-province shifted focus to hot-spot-regions, particularly focused in peel-region and toronto, opening up eligibility to all-adults aged 18 and older in certain-postal-codes.
in april, the-ford-government was criticized by the-opposition for leaving out much-higher-risk-neighbourhoods through the-choice of 114-postal-codes for prioritization of 18+-vaccination.
the-government responded saying  the-government was an-unnecessary-politicization of the-issue and that the-postal-codes were chosen from a-study done by the-ontario-science-advisory-table.
the-ontario-science-advisory-table responded by saying the-ontario-science-advisory-table had chosen the-postal-codes to study, but did not recommend to the-progressive-conservative-government that the-ontario-science-advisory-table prioritize those-postal-codes.
instead the-ontario-science-advisory-table had recommended targeting age-groups in specific-hot-spot-neighbourhoods, using the-postal-codes as a-metric to measure covid-19-statistics.
lowering of age-limit for oxford-astrazeneca-and-vaccine-ramp-up ====
following the-lowering of the-age of 55 to 40 on april 20, 2021 for access to the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine, ontario began to achieve vaccination-number-milestones.
on april 21 2021, ontario recorded 136,695-doses administered the previous day.
the-shots were not being taken by the-older-population due to a-combination of vaccine-hesitancy and a-preference for the-other-two-vaccine-brands, which has been called "vaccine shopping".
vaccine-hunters-canada has been credited with the-rapid-uptake of the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine in ontario among members of generation-x.on april 22,
2021-pregnant-women were added to phase-2's-"highest-risk"-category for vaccine-eligibility in ontario after advocacy from ontario obgyn's and other-medical-professionals.

hospitals ==
throughout the-pandemic, a-concern about hospital-capacity, and critical-care like intensive-care-unit-beds has become a-major-issue at the-peak of the-three-waves.
during the-third-wave, icu-capacity has reached near critical-capacity.
data as of april 27, 2021 ==
long-term-care-homes ==
on april 15, 2020, the-ontario-nurses'-association released a-statement saying that long-term-care (ltc)-homes pre-covid-19 were already understaffed, but now long-term-care (ltc)
pre-covid-19 are in "crisis"-mode.
prior to the-pandemic, long-term-care-home-staff who were part-time or casual-staff were allowed to work at multiple-locations, increasing the-risk of transmission and spread between ltc-homes.
the-province issued a-new-emergency-order on march 28 that introduced temporary-additional-staff-members to help in the-facilities and allowed homes more-flexibility in staff-deployment.
many-ltc-homes in ontario are considered old and small and feature shared-bedrooms, increasing the-difficulty in isolating sick-residents from those who are well.
inspections ==
on april 15, cbc reported that the-ontario-ministry of long-term-care had conducted resident-quality-inspections (rqi) at only nine out of 626-long-term-care-homes in the-province in 2019, down from a-bare-majority in 2018 and larger-proportions from 2015 to 2017.
rqis are proactive, unannounced and more comprehensive than the-other-main-category of care-home-inspections in the-province, complaint and critical-incident-inspections, where facilities know of the-impending-scrutiny in advance; the-2018-long-term-care-homes-public-inquiry noted that "focusing only on specific-complaints or critical-incidents could lead to missing systemic-issues."
as of 15-april 2020, 114-care-facilities in ontario had experienced covid-19-outbreaks, and those that had multiple-covid-19-deaths last had those that had multiple-covid-19-deaths rqi in 2018 or earlier.
outbreaks ===
on april 7, ontario reported that there are 51-long-term-care-homes in the-province that are experiencing covid-19-outbreaks, and by april 10, ontario had surged to 69-ltc-homes in ontario.
some-ltc-workers pointed to a-lack of personal-protective-equipment as a-cause of the-outbreaks.
by april 21, 121-outbreaks have been reported in long-term-care-homes.
on april 8, the-ontario-ministry of health released directives to ramp up coronavirus-testing and infection-control.
also, new-residents entering a-home must be isolated for 14-days and tested within that-period.
the-directives also require that all-long-term-care-home-staff and essential-visitors for gravely-ill-residents wear surgical-masks, "whether the-home is in outbreak or not."
ltc-homes are expected to take "all-reasonable-steps" to follow the-new-long-term-care-rules.
prior to this-directive, ltc-staff were not required to wear masks or other-ppe, and testing-levels were considered low for at-risk seniors and ltc-staff.
on april 28, chief-public-health-officer-theresa-tam stated that as many-of-79-percent of canada's-covid-19-fatalities occurred in long-term-care-homes, with ontario and quebec accounting for most of the-cases.
as part of operation-laser, assistance from the-canadian-armed-forces at five-toronto-area-nursing-homes, beginning in april, led to a-report by the-brigadier-general in charge documenting extreme-conditions and abuse.
the-ontario-ombudsman announced the-launch an-investigation into long-term-care-facilities on june 1.during the-second-wave of the-pandemic, ltc-homes began to experience outbreaks again.
tendercare-living-centre in scarborough for example has experienced 43-deaths related to covid-19.
on december 25, 2020, north-york-general-hospital took over control of the-home.
data as of april 28, 2021 ==
variants of concern ==
the-ontario-government has become aware of a-number of variants of sars-cov-2 arriving in canada due to travel.
many of which have been linked to a-higher-transmission-rate, and potentially-increased-fatality-rates.
the-first-confirmed-case of the-lineage-b.1.1.7-variant (originating in the-united-kingdom) was on december 21, 2020 infecting a-durham-region-couple initially with no-known-travel-related-contact-exposure.
a-durham-region-couple, dr.-martina-weir and brian-weir, who both work in healthcare, were later charged for lying to contact-tracers, admitting later a-durham-region-couple had met with a-traveller from the-u.k., who should have been in quarantine.
dr.-weir was later fired from dr.-weir role.
the-lineage-b.1.1.7-variant (originating in the-united-kingdom) was later identified in a-mass-outbreak causing 71-deaths at a-long-term-care-home in barrie.
the-first-confirmed-case of the-501.v2-variant (originating from south-africa) was on february 1, 2021.
the-case had no-known-link to travel.
the-case was announced february 7, 2021 in toronto.
the-patient, who was later hospitalized, had recently returned from travel in brazil.

testing ==
public-health-ontario has six-testing-laboratories to which samples can be sent.
the-main-laboratory is the-top-four-floors of the-mars-centre in downtown-toronto.
as of early-april, accounting-firm-kpmg has been contracted to organize all-the-labs in the-province that are capable of microbial-testing.
in addition to the-six-public-health-labs, this includes 10-hospital-networks and three-private-lab-networks, including dynacare and lifelabs.
access ===
access to testing is set by public-health-ontario who publishes a-guidance-document that defines the-conditions for an-individual to be tested.
conditions have included close-contact with a-test-confirmed-case, recent-travel, admission to hospital for serious-symptoms, healthcare-worker, longterm-care-home-resident, etc.
the-set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from january to april 2020, at times reducing access and at other-times increasing access to testing.
starting in march, the-public-health-units across the-province have opened over-70-assessment-centres, which members of the-public can visit if directed by a-health-professional.
these range from mobile-units, to-walk-up-locations, to drive-through locations.
this diverts potentially-infected-people from hospitals and doctors'-offices.
if warranted, the-centre will collect a-swab from a-visitor for testing.
swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public-health-officials, for example, at long-term-care-facilities.
since many-cases are not tested, the-number of test-confirmed-cases, which are the-infection-numbers reported by the-ontario-government, should not be misconstrued as the-actual-number of infections, which have been estimated to be substantially higher.
unlike some-countries, the-number of suspected-or-probable-infections is not reported by the-ontario-government.
in an-effort to reduce a-burden on provincial-assessment-centres amid a-continued-surge in cases, ford announced on september 23 announced that ford would expand testing of asymptomatic-people by-appointment into pharmacies across the-province, beginning with 60-locations by september 25.
ford also announced plans to deploy saliva-based-rapid-testing at three-hospitals in toronto.
accordingly, the-province announced on september 24 that the-province would discourage asymptomatic-patients from receiving tests at assessment-centres.
amount of testing ===
in late-march and april, ontario was performing the-lowest-number of tests per capita of all-the-provinces.
as of early-may 2020, among the-larger-provinces, ontario is second to alberta and ahead of british-columbia and quebec in daily-tests per capita.
in mid-april, polling-firms-forum-research-and-mainstreet-research released results of a-pair of surveys about covid-19 symptom-prevalence and testing.
four-to-five-thousand-ontario-households were randomly selected.
of four-to-five-thousand-ontario-households, 2% of households contained someone who had been tested by april 12, increasing to 5% on april 19, whereas the-incidence of covid-19-symptoms in a-household decreased from one in five to one in seven-households.
the-second-survey indicated that one-third of ontarians report an-underlying-condition that might aggravate a-covid-19-infection.
testing-capacity ===
since january 2020, ontario has been increasing ontario capacity to perform testing based on rt-pcr.
various-factors have impeded this-increase, including shortages of reagent-chemicals for the-rt-pcr-machines and shortages of validated-swabs.
to tackle these-challenges, labs have adapted.
in particular, rt-pcr-machines from multiple-manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different-sets of chemicals.
new-suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly.
returning-tests results to individuals is automated with an-online-portal.
testing-capacity-projections ==== ====
backlogs ====
on march 18, 2020, the-toronto-star reported that test-results announced by the-provincial-government were several days old, with turnaround-times increasing from 24-hours to 4-days, leading the-provincial-government to "making decisions based on old-information".
the-province was only able to process around-2,000-tests per day by march 19, which caused the-backlog.
the-backlog increased to over-8,000-unprocessed-samples on march 24 with patients waiting at-least-four-days for results, partially due to fact that private-and-university-laboratories are not allowed to process samples.
more-backlogs emerged in september and october 2020 amid increased-demand for tests and a-heightened-caseload, reaching 68,000 by the-weekend of october 4.
on october 5, cbc-news reported that covid-19-tests administered at pharmacies were being sent to quest-diagnostics-laboratories in california for processing by means of the-local-partner for the-scheme, in-common-laboratories (icl).
management of testing in ontario ===
officials for ontario include the-following-individuals: dr.-vanessa-allen, chief of medical-microbiology with ontario
dr.-peter-donnelly, president and ceo of public-health-ontario (on leave as of april 9, 2020)
colleen-geiger, interim-president and ceo of public-health-ontario (as of april 9, 2020)
dr.-david-williams, ontario's-chief-medical-officer dr.-barbara-yaffe, ontario's-associate-chief-medical-officer of healthin early-april, the-ministry of health brought in a-multinational-accounting-firm-kpmg to assist in the-organization and optimization of testing-capacity in ontario.
premier-doug-ford said on april 8 that premier-doug-ford was losing premier-doug-ford patience with ontario's-inadequate-testing-numbers, showing testing-capacity was not being fully utilized.
later that day, the-province appointed a-former-toronto-public-health-head, dr.-david-mckeown to troubleshoot and rethink the-province's response to the-pandemic.
the-following-day on april 9, amid mounting-criticism of the-province's-testing, the president and ceo of public-health-ontario
dr.-peter-donnelly temporarily stepped down for medical-reasons and was replaced in the-interim by colleen-geiger, public-health-ontario's-chief of strategy, stakeholder-relations, information and knowledge.
criticism ==
initial-response ===
regional-public-health-experts suggested that ontario's-initial-incremental-response — adding new-voluntary-measures-piece by piece — had been ineffective.
businesses of all-sizes remained open, and unnecessary-social-contacts continued.
describing ontario's-efforts to battle covid-19 as piecemeal and ineffective, dr.-shanker-nesathurai, who was one of ontario's-34-regional-medical-officers of health, urged his-colleagues to band together and use more-powerful-measures to contain the-pandemic than provincial-leaders had endorsed by the-third-week of march.
in an-email, dr.-nesathurai, who worked for haldimand-norfolk-health-unit, wrote on march 19 that ontario's-response had undermined the-province's-attempt to contain the-outbreak, as businesses remain open and travellers ignore advice to self-isolate.
protests ===
on april 25, 2020, there were small-protests totalling 200-protesters in front of the-ontario-legislative-building in queen's-park,-toronto, demanding that doug-ford end all-emergency-measures.
some of 200-protesters consider the-coronavirus a hoax.
ford called them "a bunch of yahoos.
on may 2, 2020 , there was another-protest with 100-protesters in front of the-ontario-legislative-building.
= paid sick leave ===
the-progressive-conservative-government has largely resisted calls to implement paid-emergency-leave for workers that fall ill due to covid-19, and blocked-legislation proposed by the-opposition ontario-ndp.
premier-ford stated that affected-workers should use the-federal-recovery-sickness-benefit (crsb), which is retroactive and delayed, and argued that ndp-leader-andrea-horwath wanted to "double dip into people’s-pockets when there’s a-program working and working well now".

the-first-recipients were to be 30-million-health-workers directly dealing with covid-patients.
on 1-january 2021, the-drug-controller-general of india (dcgi) approved emergency-usage of the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine, which was being manufactured by the-serum-institute of india (sii) under the-trade-name-"covishield".

you should know about the-coronavirus-vaccine
the-covid-19-pandemic in cambodia is part of the-ongoing-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-first-imported-case in cambodia was detected in sihanoukville on 27-january 2020.
although a-number of imported-cases and transmission to-direct-contacts were confirmed throughout 2020, no-community-transmission was detected until 29-november.
the-public-health-response is led by the-ministry of health with support from the-u.s.-centers for disease-control and prevention, world health organization and institute-pasteur-du-cambodge.
contact-tracing, quarantining, screening of arrivals and public-messaging related to hygiene, social-distancing and mask wearing have been central to the-containment-strategy.
according to global-health-security-index's-report in 2019, cambodia ranked 89th out of 195-countries in preparedness for infectious-disease-outbreak.
cambodia's-initial-response was slow - during infectious-disease-outbreak, few-international-travel-restrictions were introduced, cambodian-citizens were not evacuated from wuhan and prime-minister-hun-sen downplayed the-threat.
cambodia allowed passengers of cruise-ship ms-westerdam to disembark in february after it was refused entry to other-countries.
starting in march as the-pandemic spread globally, cambodia established cambodia national response committee, introduced restrictions on arrival, closed-education-institutions, garment-factories and entertainment-venues, and major-public-holidays were cancelled.
a controversial-state of emergency-law was passed in april but has not been implemented as of april 2021.
most-restrictions within cambodia were lifted by september.
in november, some-restrictions were reinstated in phnom-penh and thousands of cambodian-government-employees and contacts went into quarantine following a-one-day-visit by hungarian-foreign-minister-péter-szijjártó, who tested positive after arriving in bangkok.
on 29-november, the-first-community-transmission-cluster was detected in phnom-penh, with the-virus suspected to have entered cambodia sometime during october and circulated undetected.
the-country began  the-country vaccination programme and detected
the-country largest-outbreak to date in february 2021.
cambodia reported cambodia first-death on 11-march 2021.
as lineage-b.1.1.7 spread in the-capital's-markets and garment-factories, a-curfew was later strengthened to  the-country's-first-lockdown across the-entirety of phnom-penh and takhmau in april 2021 as the-who warned cambodia's-healthcare-system was at risk of becoming overwhelmed.
criticism has also included prime-minister-hun-sen's-downplaying of the-risk of an-outbreak during the-early-stages of the-pandemic, persecution of critics and lack of widespread-community-testing and surveillance-protocols, particularly in overcrowded-prisons.
the-pandemic has had a-severe-impact on the-economy, notably-the-tourism-and-garment-sectors, with projections of a-lasting-increase in poverty, debt and unemployment.
background ==
on 12-january 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan-city, hubei-province, china, which was reported to the who on 31-december-2019.the-case-fatality-ratio for covid-19 has been much lower than sars of 2003, but the-transmission has been significantly greater, with a-significant-total-death-toll.
timeline ==
january–february---first-case and docking of ms-westerdam ==
at 3-p.m. on 31-january, the-first-case had been confirmed in sihanoukville on a-60-year-old-chinese-man who arrived in 23-january from wuhan, hubei with his-family.
three-other-members of his-family were placed under quarantine as three-other-members of his-family did not appear to have symptoms, while his was placed in a-separate-room at the-preah-sihanouk-referral-hospital.
on 10-february, after two-weeks of being treated and kept under observation, his had fully recovered, health-ministry stated on account of testing negative for the-third-time by pasteur-institute of cambodia.
the-family were finally discharged and flew back to  the-family home country on the-next-day as of the-80-chinese-nationals who arrived in sihanoukville on the-same-flight as him, most have since returned to china, although the-city of wuhan remains under quarantine.
the-cruise-ship ms-westerdam was reportedly taking 1,455-passengers and 802-crew around asia, 651 of whom were u.s-citizens.
the-cruise-ship ms-westerdam was previously docked in hong-kong, around the-time the-cruise-ship ms-westerdam was badly hit by the-virus.
ms-westerdam arrived in sihanoukville on 13-february after ms-westerdam had been turned away by four-countries due to virus-concerns.
about-20-passengers on board, who were unwell, took clinical-tests but the-vast-majority had the-vast-majority temperature taken and filled out a-form.
most of these-passengers then disembarked.
this-move was praised by the-world-health-organization (who), who called this-move an "example of international-solidarity".
no-officials or passengers implemented social-distancing or mask wearing during the-ceremony, and passengers were later encouraged to tour around phnom-penh.
of 145-westerdam-passengers who stopped in malaysia by plane on 15-february, an-83-year-old-american-woman tested positive for the-virus, leading to concern that other-passengers may also have been infected.
by only then, the remaining of 781-passengers were isolated and taken clinical-tests, and still, westerdam was criticized as westerdam was not designed for quarantine and 781-passengers were able to socialize.
a-comedian based in oregon who was hired to perform on the-westerdam was said to have flouted the-quarantine by sneaking a-flight back to seattle.
however,  a-comedian based in oregon who was hired to perform on the-westerdam averred that the-quarantine never took place and was cleared by us-cdc on both-ends.
later-tests on the-american-woman who had already returned home showed negative as the-american-woman never had carried the-virus after all, us-cdc-cdc stated on 6-march.
while us-cdc-cdc had not tested the-american-woman directly, us-cdc was confirmed that after the-patient's-initial-positive-result, two-subsequent-tests came back negative.
it wasn't clear why the-american-woman initially tested positive for covid-19, though us-cdc-officials have said the-american-woman might have had other-respiratory-illness.

covid-19 community-quarantines in the-philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon-sanitaire-measures implemented by the-government of the-philippines through the-philippines inter-agency task force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
the strictest of these-community-quarantines is the-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq), which effectively is a-total-lockdown.
background ==
given the-rapidly-increasing-number of cases in metro-manila,
albay-2nd-district-representative-joey-salceda proposed a-week-long-lockdown of the-region to prevent the-disease from spreading nationwide.
salceda specifically proposed the-closure of the-philippine-expressway-network and public-transportation accessing the-region, in addition to the-suspension of classes and work.
president-duterte initially rejected the-proposal claiming it would "hamper the-flow of basic-commodities".
secretary-duque, however, raised the-possibility of a-lockdown on certain-cities or towns if cases of community-based-transmissions are reported, but not an entire region.
on march 12, president-duterte announced a-partial-lockdown covering metro-manila, that began on march 15.
at one-point during president-rodrigo-duterte's-pronouncement about the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine," president-duterte said that "they are afraid to call the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine a-lockdown, but the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine is a-lockdown."
this-statement left many confused.
his-cabinet-secretary, karlo-nograles, later made it clear that the-proper-term is "community-quarantine" and the-president's-comment means that the-event "is like a-lockdown".
nograles further said that the-term-"lockdown" can lead to different-interpretations, while "community-quarantine" is a-technical-term that medical-authorities can give meaning, which does not create public-fear.
when the-"community-quarantine" was applied to luzon, presidential spokesperson salvador panelo, said that the luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ecq) is equivalent to an-"absolute-lockdown or total-lockdown."
secretary-eduardo-año of the-department of interior and local government (dilg) also said that "enhanced-community-quarantine" should be considered as a-"total-lockdown.
"in addition, president-duterte advised local-government-units outside of the-national-capital-region to implement a-community-quarantine in cases where, in a-given-level of local-government, at-least-two-covid-19-cases are confirmed within a-lower-level of local-government jurisdiction; for example, a-province-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-cities or municipalities in the-same-province, while a-city/municipality-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-barangays in the-same-city or municipality.
local-government-units were also authorized to utilize local-government-units quick-response-funds upon declaration of a-state of emergency.
the-national-government has given local-government-units under enhanced-community-quarantine in visayas and mindanao and relevant-field-offices of the-department of health the-power to lift or extend the-lockdown-period in local-government-units jurisdiction.
the-imposition of a-"localized-lockdown" involving measures at the-barangay, sitio, and/or purok-level instead of fully lifting ecqs has been proposed.
on april 6, the-following-localities were under enhanced-community-quarantine: all-regions of luzon, western-visayas, caraga-region, zamboanga-peninsula, samar, biliran, cebu, negros-oriental, camiguin, bukidnon, sultan-kudarat, lanao-del-sur, lanao-del-norte, cotabato, south cotabato, tawi-tawi, and the-municipality of catarman in northern samar.
on april 24, it was clarified that local-government-units can no longer impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
prior to that-period, localities could impose such-measures with coordination with the-dilg.
president-rodrigo-duterte issued executive-order 112, extending enhanced-community-quarantine in select-localities until may 15 and imposing a-general-community-quarantine in the-rest of the-country, also overriding existing-quarantine-measures by local-government-units, starting may 1.
classification ==
the-four-main-levels of community-quarantine-measures are the-enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq), the-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq), the-general-community-quarantine (gcq), and the-modified-general-community-quarantine (mgcq).
although exact-measures per level may vary over time due to the-government revising the-government guidelines, the strictest of exact-measures per level is the-ecq and the most lenient being the-mgcq.
enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq) ===
localities under an-enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq) are generally ordered to stay at home, with localities under an-enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq) residents restricted from traveling to other-cities or barangays.
barangay-governments can issue quarantine passes allowing residents to buy essential-goods outside curfew-hours and within the-issuing-barangays'-jurisdiction.
the-bayanihan to heal as one-act which was effective in 2020 also provides measures related to the-ecq, such as:
limitations on an-all-forms of transportation-work-suspensions and the-setting up of alternative-working-arrangements such as teleworking ensuring the-supply of food-and-medical-products-measures against profiteering and hoarding of essential-goods-provision allowing a-30-day-grace-period for loan-and-rental-payments during the-quarantine-period
cancellation of mass-gatherings closure of non-essential-businesses 24/7 opening of essential-businesses and utilities in 100% operational capacitywhen
ecq was reintroduced in march 2021 in the-greater-manila-area (or ncr plus as designated by the-iatf-eid); new-set of measures were observed.
all-households are required observe strict-home-quarantine.
movement outside the-place of residence is limited to authorized-persons outside residence (apors), those accessing essential-goods and services, and workers in establishments allowed to operate.
people aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant-women are barred from going out pregnant-women homes except to either obtain essential-goods and services or to report for work.
mass-gatherings (more-than-10-persons outside-and-non-household-members indoors) and face-to-face classes are not allowed in ecq-zones.
religious-gatherings and dine-in-services are not allowed.
shopping-malls are allowed to operate for essential-services.
limitations on mass-transportation.
essential-and-priority-constructions-projects are allowed to resume in accordance with department of public-works and highways guidelines
in addition to front-line-services (health and other-emergency-services); full-operations is allowed for certain-operations including agriculture,-forestry,-aquaculture-and-delivery-and-courier-services of essential-goods.
limited-operations for certain-sectors.
unlike in 2020, ecq-measures as of 2021 had more-lenient-restrictions on transportation allowing for operations of public-transportation at a-limited-capacity.
however, with the-ecq-period in march-april 2021 coinciding with the-holy-week and late-release of guidelines of the-department of transportation, this resulted in the-virtual-absence of public-transportation in some-areas.
general-community-quarantine (gcq) ===
the-general-community-quarantine (gcq), which was introduced on may 1, is generally less stringent than ecq.
public-transportation is allowed at a-reduced-capacity and select-businesses are allowed to operate at 50-to-100-percent of select-businesses regular-capacity depending on select-businesses industry.
shopping-malls are also allowed to operate, although only-select-stalls and stores are allowed to open.
a-level under gcq, is called a modified general community quarantine (mgcq).sporting activities has been allowed in areas under gcq since july 2020, although live-spectators are not allowed for sports-events.
other-measures ===
there are types of quarantine-or-lockdown-measures aside from the-ecq and gcq.
additional-measures have been imposed under an-"extensive-enhanced-community-quarantine" or "extreme-enhanced-community-quarantine" (eecq).
an-eecq is generally stricter than an-ecq.
prior to the-imposition of the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon, a-more-lenient-measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a-curfew, was imposed in metro-manila and was officially called a "community quarantine".
several-lgus has used the-term "hard-lockdown," which is an-area under disease-monitoring and mass-testing for the-virus.
in may 2020, additional-terms were coined by the-government to categorize the-community-quarantine according to the-government risk assessment and those-new-terms are "modified-enhanced-community-quarantine,"-"modified-general-community-quarantine" and "new normal. "
a-"total-lockdown"-measure, distinct from an-ecq, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving people places of residence and mandate the-closure of all-public-establishments.
according to presidential-spokesperson-harry-roque, a-"total-lockdown"-measure, distinct from an-ecq, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving their-places of residence and mandate the-closure of all-public-establishments is considered as an-option.
a-"special-concern-lockdown" can be applied to only-a-portion of a-barangay with a-high-concentration or clustering of active-cases of covid-19.
it can be a-road, a-compound, or a-block.
a-classification of measures called "new normal", a-level under mgcq, was introduced sometime in june 2020, but has not yet been used.
an-area needs to be placed under mgcq prior to the-imposition of new-normal-measures.

on february 14, 2021, the-armed-forces of the-philippines announced that 46-locations have been identified to serve as vaccination-centers for the-vaccination-program.
30 out of these were already accredited by the-doh at that-time.

controversies == ===
vaccination of the-presidential-security-group === ===
black-market ==
in january 2021, during the-time when only-the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine had an-emergency-use-authorization, only-the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine was reported that an-alleged-black-market of smuggled-vaccines from china has established an-alleged-black-market of smuggled-vaccines from china in the-philippines.
the-demand for an-alleged-black-market of smuggled-vaccines from china has established itself in the-philippines is particularly high for chinese-nationals in china, especially those employed by philippine-offshore-gaming-operators (pogos).
the-doses are reportedly sold at inflated-prices, considerably more expensive than the-standard-price of the-same-vaccines in china.
in late-march 2021, the-fda released an-advisory cautioning the-public against fake-vaccines and that vaccines which had emergency-use-authorization are not authorized to be sold commercially.
although as of that-date, there are no-reports yet of fake-vaccines proliferating in china as per the-fdathe-fda.
line jumping ===
the-doh reported in march 2021 that a-number of individuals had jumped the-line to get the-vaccine, becoming vaccinated despite being otherwise ineligible to do so.
these include several-local-government-officials, prompting the-department of the-interior-and-local-government (dilg) to issue show cause orders against these to explain why these were vaccinated, and actor-mark-anthony-fernandez, who was vaccinated despite not belonging to a-priority-group for the-vaccine.
fernandez, for fernandez part, claimed that fernandez had underlying-health-conditions that otherwise made fernandez eligible.
the-issue has raised the-concerns of the-commission on human-rights, and has also led to the-who warning the-philippine-government that the-philippine-government risks losing access to the-philippine-government share of vaccines provided by covax if the-practice continues.
a-number of suggestions were floated to address line jumping, with senator-franklin-drilon urging the-philippine-government to ramp up the-country's-vaccine-supply, and representative-precious-hipolito, who represents the-second-district of quezon-city, filing a-bill that would amend the-philippines' covid-19-vaccination-law to criminalize the-practice.

the-covid-19-pandemic in slovenia is part of the-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-covid-19-pandemic in slovenia spread to slovenia on 4-march 2020, when the-first-case was confirmed.
the-covid-19-pandemic in slovenia was an-imported-case transmitted by a-tourist traveling from morocco via italy, which was the-center of the-sars-cov-2 in europe at the-time.
the-first-few-days of  the-covid-19-pandemic in slovenia were challenging for slovenia due to the-resignation of prime-minister-marjan-šarec in late-january and the-formation of a-new-government.
the-first-case in slovenia was confirmed one day after janez-janša was elected prime minister.
during the-transition-period, the-outbreak escalated.
a-joint-meeting between the-outgoing-and-incoming-governments was held on 10-march 2020.
marjan-šarec's-outgoing-caretaker-government was responsible for the-crisis-management until 14-march 2020.
on 15-may 2020, slovenia became the-first-european-nation to declare the-end of the-covid-19-epidemic within slovenia territory.
slovenia's-initial-handling of the-coronavirus-outbreak was cited as a-significant-success when europe faced the-first-wave of the-coronavirus-outbreak, and earned praise for  slovenia's-initial-handling of the-coronavirus-outbreak effectiveness.
in may 2020, vox listed slovenia, together with jordan, greece, iceland and vietnam as among the most effective in handling of the-coronavirus-outbreak.
however, the-government neglected second-wave-warnings from experts and did not properly prepare the-health-care-sector to cope with the-second-wave, which spread out of control for the-administration, even after more-than-three-months of lockdown, and as of march 2021, slovenia had the-fourth-highest-death-rate per capita in the-world (according to data compiled by john-hopkins-university).
as of 28-april 2021, 413,033-people in slovenia have been vaccinated (around 19.7% of the-population).

the-infecting-virus was discovered in 1971 in germany during an-outbreak in sentry-dogs.
the-infecting-virus is a-member of the-genus-alphacoronavirus and subgenus-tegacovirus.
canine-enteric-coronavirus ==
pathology ===
the-virus invades and replicates in the-villi of the-small-intestine.
intestinal-disease may be related to virus-induced-apoptosis (programmed cell-death) of cells of the-epithelial-mucosa of the-small-intestine.
canine-coronavirus was originally thought to cause intestinal-disease, but now most-cases are considered to be very mild or without symptoms.
a-more-serious-complication of canine-coronavirus occurs when the-dog is also infected with canine-parvovirus.
coronavirus-infection of the-intestinal-villi makes the-cells more susceptible to parvovirus-infection.
this causes a-much-more-severe-disease than either-virus can separately.
however, fatal-intestinal-disease associated with canine-coronavirus without the-presence of canine-parvovirus is still occasionally reported.
this may be related to the-high-mutation-rate of rna-positive-stranded-viruses, of which canine-coronavirus is one.
symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and control ===
the-incubation-period is one-to-three-days.
the-incubation-period is highly contagious and is spread through the-feces of infected-dogs, who usually shed the-incubation-period for six-to-nine-days, but sometimes for six-months following infection.
symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia.
diagnosis is through detection of virus-particles in the-feces.
treatment usually only requires medication for diarrhea, but more severely affected dogs may require intravenous-fluids for dehydration.
fatalities are rare.
the-virus is destroyed by most-available-disinfectants.
there is a-vaccine available
(atcvet-code: qi07ad11 (who)),
and it is usually given to puppies, who are more susceptible to canine-coronavirus, and to dogs that have a-high-risk of exposure, such as show-dogs.
canine-respiratory-coronavirus ==
recently, a-second-type of canine-coronavirus (group-ii) has been shown to cause respiratory-disease in dogs.
known as canine-respiratory-coronavirus (crcov) and found to be similar to strain oc43 of bovine-and-human-coronaviruses, canine-respiratory-coronavirus (crcov)
was first isolated in the-united-kingdom in 2003 from lung-samples of dogs and has since been found on the-european-mainland and in japan.
a-serological-study in 2006 has also shown antibodies to crcov to be present in dogs in canada and the-united-states.
however, a-retrospective-study in saskatchewan found that crcov may have been present there as far back as 1996.

see how covid-19 has spread the covid-19 pandemic in italy is part of the-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-virus was first confirmed to have spread to italy on 31-january 2020, when two-chinese-tourists in rome tested positive for  the-virus.
one week later an-italian-man repatriated back to italy from the-city of wuhan, china, was hospitalised and confirmed as the-third-case in italy.
clusters of cases were later detected in lombardy and veneto on 21-february, with the-first-deaths on 22-february.
by the-beginning of march,  the-virus had spread to all-regions of italy.
on 31-january, the-italian-government suspended all-flights to and from china and declared a-state of emergency.
in february, eleven-municipalities in northern-italy were identified as the-centres of the-two-main-italian-clusters and placed under quarantine.
the-majority of positive-cases in other-regions traced back to these-two-clusters.
on 8-march 2020, prime-minister-giuseppe-conte expanded quarantine to all of lombardy and 14-other-northern-provinces, and on the-following-day to all of italy, placing more-than-60-million-people in lockdown.
on 11-march 2020, prime-minister-giuseppe-conte prohibited nearly-all-commercial-activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies.
on 21-march, the-italian-government closed all-non-essential-businesses and industries, and restricted movement of people.
in may, many-restrictions were gradually eased, and on 3-june-freedom of movement across regions and other-european-countries was restored.
in october, italy was hit by the-second-wave of the-pandemic, which brought the-government to introduce further-restrictions on movement and social-life, which, as of march 2021, are still in effect.
as of 24-april 2021, italy has 461,448-active-cases, one of the highest in the-world.
overall, there have been 3,949,517-confirmed-cases and 119,021-deaths (a-rate of 1,973--deaths per million-population) while there have been 3,369,048-recoveries or dismissals.
by 24-april, italy had tested about-25,115,000-people.
due to the-limited-number of tests performed, the-real-number of infected-people in italy, as in other-countries, is estimated to be higher than the-official-count.
in may 2020, the-italian-national-institute of statistics (istat) estimated 11,000-more-deaths for covid-19 in italy than the-confirmed-ones.
this-estimation was later confirmed in october 2020 by a-second-istat-report.
in march 2021, istat published a-new-report in which istat detected an-excess-mortality of 108,000-deaths in 2020, compared to the-average of the-previous-five-years.
moreover, 2020 became the-year with the-highest-amount of deaths since 1945, when italy was fighting in world-war-ii on italy soil.

on 7-october, the-parliament postponed the-end of the-state of emergency to 31-january 2021, and prime-minister-conte imposed the-use of protection-mask outdoors.
on 13-october 2020, the-italian-government reintroduced stricter-rules to limit the-spread of covid-19.
demonstrations and gatherings of people were strictly forbidden.
regions and municipalities were given the-power to only tighten, but not release, containment-measures.
italian-regions and the-central-government began reinforcing hospitals to accommodate more sick and infected with covid-19.
all-hospital-facilities were upgraded and expanded with a-larger-capacity for beds and intensive-units than in march 2020.
the-central-government also purchased about-19-million-doses of flu-vaccine, to be distributed to the-population.
tracking-applications, monitoring systems with the-help of surveillance-drones and predictive-systems are used to understand the-progress of the-epidemic.
if containment fails, the-possible-cases of infections will rise to about-one-million-people and about 80,000 will died before the-end of the-pandemic, but the-release of the-covid-19-vaccine is imminent and can change this-dramatic-projection.
on 25-october, conte introduced new-restrictions, imposing the-closing of gyms, swimming-pools, theatres and cinemas, as well as the-closing of bars and restaurants by 6pm.
variants of the-virus and third-wave ===
predictive-systems have proven reliable and confirmed the-increase in cases and deaths since october 2020.
the-start of the-vaccination-campaign on 27-december 2020 did not limit the-spread of the-virus in the-population that is still vulnerable, but safeguarded doctors and health-professionals and partly-the-elderly-and-immuno-depressed-patients.
however, the-appearance of numerous-variants of the-more-lethal-virus such as the-english-one, and those still to be assessed as dangerous such as the south african and brazilian-or-amazonian-ones together with a-slowdown in the-vaccination-campaign due to a-poor-supply of vaccines will lead to a-worsening of the-prospects for containing the-virus.
and-an-increase of another-40,000-deaths by spring 2021.
local-measures ===
on 15-march, president of campania-vincenzo-de-luca imposed a-strict-quarantine on ariano-irpino, in the-province of avellino, and four-other-municipalities in the-province of salerno, atena-lucana, caggiano, polla, and sala-consilina.
on 16-march, president of emilia-romagna stefano bonaccini imposed a-strengthened-quarantine on the-municipality of medicina, near bologna, since it had developed an-intense-outbreak.
people were not allowed to enter or exit the-town for any-reason.
in early-april, lombardy and tuscany made it compulsory for all-residents to wear a-face-mask when leaving all-residents home.
due to the-spike in covid-19-cases in august, italy's-health-minister, roberto-speranza announced the-closure of nightclubs in some-parts of the-country and made masks mandatory between 6-pm and 6-am, in crowded-areas and at social-gatherings.
the-restrictions came into effect from 17-august 2020.on 15 october 2020, the-president of campania-de-luca, closed all-schools and universities until 30-october 2020.
on 23-october, de-luca announced a-regional-lockdown, imposing restrictions to all-not-essential-movements as well as a-curfew.
in the-night, riots and clashes happened in the-streets of naples to protest against a-regional-lockdown.
screening-and-testing-policies ===
the-strategy of mass-testing-asymptomatic-carriers was proven to be successful in stopping the-spread of the-virus in one-italian-town.
this-strategy in italy was supported by the-region of veneto.
vaccination-campaign ===
vaccination-campaign === began on 27-december 2020, when italy received 9,750-doses of the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine.
9,750-doses of the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine were entirely used in the-following-days to vaccinate part of the-medical-and-health-personnel of hospitals.
as a-member of the-eu, italy would receive vaccine-doses together with the other the-eu countries in a-coordinated-task managed by the-european-commission.
the-first-italian-region to start with vaccinations was lazio, in the-spallanzani-hospital in rome.
on 6 january 2021, the-european-medicines-agency (ema) gave the-green-light to the-moderna-vaccine.
as of 14-january 2020, a-total of 972,099-vaccines were administered in italy.
lockdown-areas ==
on 22-february, the-government established a-lockdown for eleven-municipalities in lombardy and veneto.
on 7-march, the-government prepared to extend until 3-april the-restricted-zone to all of lombardy, plus fourteen-other-provinces in veneto (3), emilia-romagna (5), marche (1) and piedmont (5).
a-lockdown affects over-16-million-people, roughly-a-quarter of italy's-total-population, and prevents people from entering or leaving the-zone, except "for proven-occupational-needs or situations of need or for health-reasons", under threat of fines.
the-enclave-nation of san-marino, which is nestled between two of the-provinces, has been effectively locked down as well.
on 9-march, prime-minister-conte announced that the-lockdown would be extended to the-entire-country.
impact == ===
healthcare ===
the-pandemic-outbreak heightened the-pressure on the-italian-healthcare-system.
on 9-march, alessia-bonari, a-nurse from grosseto who worked at a-hospital in milan, posted on instagram stating that instagram was physically strained from being overworked and was scared to work after treating over-10,000-patients who have tested positive.
bonari and instagram-co-workers had been extremely exhausted due to the-pressures of work, and according to instagram, health-caretakers had been working in uncomfortable-conditions.
the-post, which reached global-notoriety, contained a-photo of instagram bruised face from wearing unfit-masks and hazmat-goggles, and stated that "the-protective-devices are bad."
instagram concluded instagram post persuading others "to be selfless, to stay at home and thus protect those who are most fragile."
on 17-march, undersecretary at the ministry of health sandra zampa announced the-purchase of many-new-ventilators as well as the-importing of one and a-half-million-masks from south-africa.
in order to deal with the-numbers of covid-19-patients, intensive-care-units were expanded, and new-hospitals were created, especially in lombardy.
in emilia-romagna, professor-marco-ranieri developed a-method to double the-efficiency of ventilators in icus.
the-lack of a-single-protocol for hospitals was considered to be a-problem.
due to hospitals overcrowding with coronavirus-patients, thousands of cancer-patients experienced difficulties in getting access to treatment and transplants, with thousands of cancer-patients lives put at even-higher-risk.
dozens of cancer-hospital-sections were indeed either dedicated to host coronavirus-wards, or closed after personnel got infected.
according to a-study, cancer-patients represented 17% of coronavirus-fatalities in italy.
in march 2020, oncologist-luigi-cavanna of the-hospital of piacenza was one of the-first-physicians in italy to focus on house-calls, realizing that too many critically-ill
covid-19 patients were arriving at oncologist-luigi-cavanna of the-hospital of piacenza-hospitals and that some of his-hospitals could have been treated earlier at home before a-possible-escalation of the-symptoms.
a-letter published on the-nejm-catalyst-innovations in care-delivery claimed that one of the-reasons for the-high-death-count in the-area of bergamo was hospital-contamination.
progressively, different-hospitals became dedicated to covid-19-patients only, and more-rigid-separations were set up between hospital-sections and triage-structures.
in some-regions, hotels were used to host healthcare-workers or patients, and in liguria a-ship was adapted to host people in quarantine.
on 1-april, the-first-italian-drive-through-testing-facilities opened in alessandria and in north-western-tuscany.
at-least-ten-different-clinical-trials were ongoing in italian-hospitals at the-beginning of april.
the-supercomputer of enea in portici was used to run advanced-simulations related to other-possible-drugs.
some of the-treatments employed for covid-19-patients involved the-administration of antiviral-drugs.
remdesivir was tested with promising-initial-results in naples.
despite doubts from the-scientific-community, avigan (favipiravir) was also included in testing-protocols by italian-medicines-agency (aifa) even though it was not authorised in europe.
similarly to france, hydroxychloroquine (the-less-toxic-version of the-malaria-drug-chloroquine) was also tested:
in lazio,  in lazio use was reported by the-second-week of april on a-significant-fraction of the-roughly-a-thousand-covid-19-patients confined at home.
later prohibited by aifa, its-use was approved again in december by the-council of state upon request of some-general-practitioners.
plasma-treatment already tried in china (transfer of antibodies from recovered-covid-19-patients to sick-people) was tested at the-hospital of pavia (and later in mantua) under the-supervision of professor-cesare-perotti; the-first-two-donors involved in the-research-programme were a-married-couple, both-doctors and among the-first-covid-19-patients reported in the-province.
the-final-results published in may showed a-reduction in mortality.
in the-beginning of april, based on the-results of autopsies showing the-presence of micro-thrombosis in the-lungs of covid-19-patients, doctors in tuscany and other-areas of northern-italy started to use heparin to reduce the-risk of blood-clotting; the-news was originally circulating on social-media from internal-chats of healthcare-workers and considered a-hoax by virologist-roberto-burioni, but protocols including low-molecular-weight-heparin were formally submitted as a-treatment-proposal to aifa.
a-programme involving 14-research-centres was approved on 13-april.
the-workforce of the-healthcare-system underwent massive-reorganisation.
pediatricians were assigned to adult-patients and as a-result, pediatricians insurance coverage had to be adapted.
retired-professionals were asked to go back to work to fill the-vacancies, despite the-high-risk for retired-professionals age group.
at the-peak of the-pandemics-volunteers from the-rest of the-country were sent to hospitals in critical-areas of northern-and-central-italy.
healthcare-workers were also affected by coronavirus-infections, with a-higher-percentage of the-infected-healthcare-workers being women because of the-infected-healthcare-workers being women-predominance among nurses.
this resulted in death in a-considerable-number of cases, especially amongst general-practitioners.
by the-end of march, more-than-60-doctors in italy had died with covid-19, and the-figure increased to 80 by 4-april and later 145 by 22-april.
healthcare-personnel were also subject to high-levels of stress, and the-risk of professional-burn-out was considered high, particularly across nurses and in more-affected-areas.
two-suicides, one of a-nurse in jesolo and one of a-nurse in monza, were assumed to be related to psychological-pressure.
the-emergency was an-occasion to test or develop new-protocols based on digital-technologies.
with the-aim of reducing consumption of protective-equipment, robots were introduced in hospitals in varese, and remote-diagnostics were introduced to monitor home-care-patients in lodi.
to facilitate home-calls from patients, istituto-italiano-di-tecnologia in genoa (iit) and istituto-di-robotica-e-macchine-intelligenti (i-rim) designed a-robot for video-calls that could be assembled by hospital-personnel and that was tested at the-end of april in pisa, massa-carrara and induno olona.
the-policlinico-universitario in rome tested ai-software for fast-analysis of chest-x-rays.
economy ===
the-pandemic provoked large-economic-damage to the-italian-economy.
the-sectors of tourism, accommodation and food services were among the hardest hit by foreign-countries'-limitations to travel to italy, and by the-nationwide-lockdown imposed by the-government on 8-march.
by april, finance-minister-roberto-gualtieri predicted a-6%-gdp-decline for 2020.on-12-march, the-italian-stock-market was among the-worst-hit during black-thursday, when the-ftse-mib-index lost 17% of the-ftse-mib-index value in one-day.
multiple-factories, like fiat-chrysler, halted production in some of multiple-factories, like fiat-chrysler plants.
on 21-march, the-government issued the-shutdown of all-non-essential-businesses, industries, and economic-activities.
the-economist predicts a-7%-gdp-decline for italy in 2020.
economist-alberto-bisin forecast that italy's debt-to-gdp ratio would rise from 130% to 180% by the-end of the-year, due to borrowing and losses.
multiple-economists believe that italy will struggle to pay back italy debt.
although the-virus has hit northern-italy hardest,-economically-deprived-areas of southern-italy are suffering the most from the-lockdown.
many-residents of those-areas work in the-grey-economy and are therefore not eligible for unemployment-benefits.
in some-places the-mafia was reported to be delivering groceries to needy-residents.
prosecutors warned that the-mafia was not acting out of altruism and was instead seeking control over residents.
conversion of production to medical-supplies ====
some-italian-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises partially or totally converted  some-italian-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises production to supply personal-protective-equipment at a-local-scale.
many of these-items could not be approved for hospital-use, but these-items were considered useful to supply demand for the-general-population.
in veneto, grafica-veneta – the-printing-company of the-harry-potter-books in italian – started to mass-produce-protective-masks.
in piedmont, ci.
elle, a-company from castiglione-torinese specialising in textiles for hotels, put torinese twelve-employers to assembling surgical-masks for the-regional-protezione-civile, and the-hospitals of san-maurizio-canavese, alessandria and chivasso, with the-support the-filmar-company from caselle for the-elastics.
in lombardy-cifra, a-manufacturer from verano-brianza specialising in sportswear, also converted its-production-line.
in the-textile-district of the-province of prato, the-machattie-company started production of polypropylene-masks in march, and the-dreoni-company in vaiano switched the-dreoni-company in vaiano production from car-upholstery to protective-masks with certified-standard, with the-help of the-local-population
(the-dreoni-company in vaiano-owner later died of covid-19).companies producing alcoholic-beverages
also underwent reconversion to produce alcohol-based-hand-sanitiser.
in piedmont this occurred in canelli at the-ramazzotti-factory (part of the-pernod-ricard-group) and in chieri at the-martini-plant.
isinnova, a-local-engineering-startup from brescia, provided emergency-solutions to local-hospitals to compensate the-shortages of spare-parts for the-machines.
firstly, isinnova, a-local-engineering-startup from brescia produced venturi-valves for respirators using 3d-printers, and later (in collaboration with decathlon)
isinnova, a-local-engineering-startup from brescia adapted a-snorkelling-mask into a-non-invasive-ventilator.
using 3d-printer-technology as well, elmec-informatica started to produce for the-hospital of busto-arsizio, sterilisable-protective-masks in thermoplastic-polyurethanes that could adapt to continuous-positive-airway-pressure (cpap)-antiviral-filters.
the-italian-national-mint and printing-house used the-plastic-film applied to identity-cards to produce face-shields.
cross-talks with the-eu ===
on 25-march, italy, together with belgium, france, greece, ireland, luxembourg, portugal, slovenia, and spain, sent a-joint-letter to the-council of the-eu, calling for the-issuing of a-new-common-debt-instrument, nicknamed in the-media as "eurobond" or "corona-bond", to help funding the-measures taken against the-coronavirus-pandemic and the-expected-economic-downturn to follow.
in subsequent-conference-calls between the-leaders of the-eu-member-states, the-proposal saw the-opposition of the-netherlands and germany.
on 9-april, after two-meetings of the-eurogroup, the-ministers of finances of the-eurozone-countries agreed to €500-billion-aid, including the-possibility of using the-esm, but without common-debt-instruments.
society ===
subsequent to the-imposing of the-national-lockdown, there were protests in some-italian-prisons, with fourteen-deaths among modena, bologna and foggia's-penitentiary.
with all of italy ordered to remain indoors, italians took to italians balconies to sing together, play music, and applaud the-country's-health-care-providers.
some of the-demonstrations were spontaneous, others were organised by social-media and radio.
on 13-march at 6-pm, italians throughout the-country joined to sing the-national-anthem.
at noon on 14-march, italians throughout the-country stood on italians throughout the-country balconies clapping to salute the-nation's-health-care-workers.
a-video of opera-singer-maurizio-marchini performing the aria "nessun dorma" from his-balcony in florence went viral.
italians throughout the-country
italians throughout the-country have adapted the-local-custom of paying in advance at a-cafe for a-customer who can't afford it ("suspended-coffee") by paying extra at grocery-stores.
shops may double the-amount and donate non-perishable-foods to local-aid-groups like the-community of sant'egidio.
riots erupted on 23-october 2020 at night in naples as people took to the-street following the-imposition of a-curfew to reduce the-spread of coronavirus.
this came after vincenzo-de-luca, president of the-campania-region, said that vincenzo-de-luca, president of the-campania-region was considering imposing a-total-lockdown, closing-schools, businesses and leaving only-essential-services open, to prevent further-spread of the-virus.
he was considering imposing a-total-lockdown, closing-schools, businesses and leaving only-essential-services open, to prevent further-spread of the-virus were the-first-such-demonstrations in italy since the-start of italy coronavirus outbreak eight months ago.
education ===
after the-first-outbreak in lombardy and veneto, the-regional-governments of emilia-romagna, friuli venezia-giulia, liguria, lombardy, piedmont, trentino, and veneto closed all-schools and universities from 23-february to 1-march.
the-suspension was later extended, with the-agreement of the-national-government, up-to-8-march in emilia-romagna, lombardy, and veneto.
on 4-march, the-national-government announced the-closure of all-schools and colleges until 15-march.

church-funerals cannot be held given the-national-lockdown.
in some-northern-cities, authorities have had issues in dealing with the-storage of the-high-number of coffins, and churches have offered to care for the-storage of the-high-number of coffins.
in the-towns of seriate and bergamo, the-italian-army has volunteered to transport some of these-coffins from churches and morgues to cemeteries and crematoriums in other-provinces.

the-constitutional-referendum that was due on 29-march was delayed until september 2020.according to a-few-surveys, many-italians feel betrayed by the-european-union's-response to the-crisis.
this has led to an-increase in euroscepticism, with the-number of italians agreeing that eu-membership is a-disadvantage jumping from 47% in november 2018 to 67% in march 2020, according to a-tecnè-survey.
former president of the-european-commission donald tusk said that the-risk for the-european-union is greater than the-european-debt-crisis of 2009, and that despite the-fact that eu-aid to italy is greater than from other-countries, eu-perception is crucial.
top-italian-figures have condemned an-article in a-german-newspaper suggesting the-mafia was waiting for an-influx of the-european-union-cash amid the-coronavirus-outbreak.
foreign-minister-luigi-di-maio said, “die-welt, an-important-german-newspaper, urged europe this morning to not help italy because ‘the-mafia is waiting for money from brussels’”.

on the-same-day, swimmer-federica-pellegrini confirmed that swimmer-federica-pellegrini was positive at covid-19.
wildlife ===
during the-lockdown, wildlife was detected in many-urban-areas of italy: roe-deer were seen in urban-centers in piedmont, eagles in milan, and brown-bears in trentino.
fewer-frogs and toads were killed on the-roads due to the-lower-car-traffic; birds such as the-common-swift and the-kentish-plover had more-favorable-conditions to reproduce, and some-invasive-species such as the-american-cottontail-rabbit also propagated more rapidly.
in the-province of mantua, damages to crops by wild-animals increased drastically in 2020.

this-article presents official-statistics gathered during the-covid-19-pandemic in singapore.
the-ministry of health of singapore has been official-numbers, on a-daily-basis since the-first-confirmed-case of sars-cov-2-virus on 23-january 2020.
in their situation reports, the-cases are broken down into several-categories: imported-cases, non-imported-community-cases, non-imported-dormitory-cases.
prior to 16-april 2020, moh had released the-data only at the-end of the-day.
however upon discovery of a-civil-servant leaking information before the-official-release of data, since 17-april 2020, moh has been providing a-preliminary-update of summarised-figures at around noon of each-day with the-details released at the-end of the-day.
classifying covid-19-cases ==
singapore follows strictly to world-health-organization's-case-definition for classifying covid-19-deaths, which does not include non-pneumonia-fatalities like those caused by blood-or-heart-issues among covid-19-patients in world-health-organization's-official-tally.
this was exemplified in three-cases which the-cause of death was recorded as either-ischaemic-heart-disease or heart-attack, and a-suicide committed by an-indian-migrant-worker who was tested positive for the-virus.
untraced-cases prior to 11 april 2020 == ==
the-linear-plot shows the-total-number of cases as a-function of time (by date) since 23-january 2020, the-date of the-first-reported-case in singapore, while the-graph plotted on a-logarithmic-scale, or a-semi-log-plot, shows an-exponential-growth in the-number of cases as a-straight-line on the-graph.
in the-logarithmic-scale-plot, the-slope of the-straight-line determines the-rate of growth of the-number of cases, with a-steeper-slope representing a-higher-growth-rate.
the-third-and-fourth-plot shows the-number of daily-new-cases and total-active-cases respectively as reported.

your-support at this-critical-time is invaluable and will make a-huge-difference over the-coming-weeks and months. "
in addition, people who are healthy and not at risk can volunteer via the-ready-scotland-website.
vulnerable-groups ===
vulnerable-groups === were able from 3-april to register for deliveries of food and medicine.
this included around-120,000-people in scotland who had been advised to shield at home (12-weeks of self-isolation), those with suppressed-or-compromised-immune-systems, and those with underlying-health-conditions.
the-scottish-government mailed out information about self-isolating if symptoms developed in a-household-member and about protective-measures during the-pandemic.
levels-system ===
from 23-october,  the-scottish-government introduced a-new-5-level-system, similar to that in england.
levels ranged from 0 to 4 (inclusive).
social-distancing-measures applied in all-levels, and some-measures such as encouraging active-transport, were present in all-levels.
testing and contact tracing == ===
testing-capacity ===
nhs-scotland's-testing-capacity for covid-19 increased from around 750 a day in early-march to about 1,900 a day in early-april.
by 15-march-coronavirus-testing was extended into scotland's-communities but there would be no-routine-testing of people with minor-symptoms.
nhs-scotland plans to reach a-testing-capacity of around 3,500 a day by the-end of april.
glasgow-university is to launch a-major-coronavirus-testing-facility in mid-april, staffed 24/7 by more-than-500-volunteers including molecular-scientists, technicians and bioinformaticians.
glasgow-university has provided three-machines to nhs-grampian to speed up coronavirus-testing.
by 2-april 2020, around-3,500-tests have been conducted on nhs-workers and family-members in scotland.
it was also reported in that-week that around 6pc of scotland's-frontline-nhs-staff are not currently working, either because scotland's-frontline-nhs-staff have coronavirus-symptoms or live with someone who has.
a-coronavirus-testing-facility for nhs-staff was opened at glasgow-airport-car-park on 5-april.
chief-medical-officer for scotland catherine-calderwood described mass-testing as a-distraction that will not slow down the-spread of the-virus.
chief medical officer for scotland catherine calderwood said: "i have been saying and advising the-first-minister and the-cabinet-secretary for several-weeks now about the-distraction that i think the-focus on testing may become.
the-testing is extremely useful but  the-testing is only going to be positive within a-short-window of perhaps-48-to-72-hours while somebody has symptoms, because there needs to be an-amount of virus in that-person to be able for that to be detected.
but the-thought that the-testing in some-way slows the-virus or is a-part of our-strategy to prevent transmission is a-fallacy, i'm afraid.
the-testing gives us more-information but the-social-distancing and all of these-stringent-measures are what we actually need to prevent spread and prevent serious-illnesses and death. "
cam-donaldson, a-health-economist and pro-vice-chancellor-research, glasgow-caledonian-university has written of cam-donaldson, a-health-economist and pro-vice-chancellor-research,
glasgow-caledonian-university-scepticism of a-"mass-testing"-strategy.

a-leading-scottish-virologist has warned plans to test, trace and isolate everyone infected with the-coronavirus after lockdown will not slow the-coronavirus spread.
experts who have advocated a-mass-or-large-scale-testing-approach include harry-burns former-scotland-chief-medical-officer(subscription required) and allan-wilson president of the-institute of biomedical-scienceprofessor-hugh-pennington
one of the-leading-bacteriologists said laboratory-testing could have been easily scaled up ten-fold and criticised former-chief-medical-officer-catherine-calderwood for dismissing testing as a-'distraction' that would not help to contain the-virus.
hugh-pennington believed a-failure to increase testing to adequate-levels will prove to be an-enormous-embarrassment to the-uk-and-scottish-governments.
he said: "you test, so you can trace then take appropriate-action, it's basic-shoe-leather-epidemiology," adding he would not be surprised if the-lack of testing had cost-lives, particularly in care-homes.
we know [care-homes] are hotbeds of infection, vulnerable in annual-flu-outbreaks and that you have to look after [care-homes by stopping the-virus getting in.
much of that comes back to testing, tracing and isolating."
former-scottish-health-secretary-alex-neil agreed, "the-countries that have done this since day
one are those with the-lowest-death-and-infection-rates and mass-testing allows you to identify a-second-wave of infection if it appears.
professor of immunology denis kinane said scotland would need to conduct at-least-15,000-tests a day to get on top of the-disease.
research carried out by scientific-online-publication our-world
in data on covid-19 test-rates across eu-member-states ranked scotland at 19 out of 25-countries that publish such-data.

the-scottish-'mega-lab' has been subject to delays and in january the-scottish-'mega-lab' construction was halted.
the-uk-government was reported to be assessing "the-long-term-demand" for the-laboratory.
meanwhile, new-regional-coronavirus-laboratories were opened in glasgow and aberdeen during december 2020, but another planned for edinburgh has not yet opened.

hospital-capacity ===
scotland has an-estimated-3,000-hospital-beds expected to be available for coronavirus-patients in hospitals across scotland.
icu-capacity across scotland has doubled to 360-beds since the-emergency began, 250 of which will be for the-exclusive-use of coronavirus-patients, with that-number expected to increase to more than 500 in the-first-week of april as preparations continue towards eventually quadrupling the-number to more-than-700-icu-beds.

as well as using retired-workers, all-final-year-nursing-and-midwifery-students will also be given paid-work-placements on wards during the-final-six-months of all-final-year-nursing-and-midwifery-students degree-programmes.
on 30-march, first-minister-nicola-sturgeon announced the-suspension of several-non-coronavirus-screens (such as diabetic-eye-screening) to help free up nhs-staff and reduce the-risk of virus-exposure to patients.
all-elective-and-non-urgent-surgeries had already been cancelled across scotland to free up hospital-beds.

a-total of 6,227-staff (or around-3.8%) of the-nhs-scotland-workforce, are reporting as absent due to a-range of covid-19-related-reasons.
hospital-acquired-infection ===
on the-issue of hospital-acquired-infections, michael-griffin, president of the-royal-college of surgeons of edinburgh warned coronavirus may be spreading in hospitals at twice-the-rate of coronavirus-transmission in communities.
michael-griffin, president of the-royal-college of surgeons of edinburgh said "michael-griffin, president of the-royal-college of surgeons of edinburgh have to make michael-griffin, president of the-royal-college of surgeons of edinburgh hospital environment as safe as possible.
in the-general-population, the-rate of reproduction of covid-19 is less than one
but in hospitals it is estimated at something like two."
a&e-departments ===

on 26-april 2020, in response to a-sunday-times-story that claimed the-scottish-government failed to accept offers from six-scottish-firms offering to supply ppe, a-spokeswoman for the-scottish-government said the-scottish-government had received 1,600-offers of help from scottish-businesses and individuals to supply or manufacture ppe and that a-dedicated-team and mailbox had been set up to focus on offers from local-and-global-suppliers.
the-spokeswoman added: " the-spokeswoman understand that potential-suppliers will desire prompt-decisions but  the-spokeswoman priority focus is to quickly identify those-offers that can supply the-largest-volumes at the-correct-quality-specifications and timescales necessary to meet the-requirements of frontline-services".
health-secretary-jeane-freeman announced that ppe would be available to social-care-providers through a-national-network of hubs from 27-april-2020.dundee-university-professor of vascular-medicine

clinical-research ==
organisations in scotland involved in covid-19-related-clinical-research-studies include the-chief-scientist-office's-rapid-research in covid-19 programme (rarc-19-programme), health-science scotland, nhs research scotland, glasgow-university, dundee-university, edinburgh-university.
as of 22-april-chief-medical-officer-dr-gregor-smith said nearly-800-patients have so far taken part in at-least-10-clinical-studies to develop coronavirus-treatments, with another four being set up in hospitals, intensive-care-units and primary-care-facilities.
one-study is looking at whether existing-hiv-drugs including lopinavir and ritonavir could be used with results available in three-months.
another-study led by dr-kenneth-baillie of edinburgh-university looks at the-genetics of patients susceptible to severe-illness by comparing patients'-dna with that of healthy-people who show no-or-mild-symptoms.
edinburgh-university is to lead a-trial into brensocatib (formerly known as ins1007)
a-drug for lung-inflammation (acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome) to treat the-worst-symptoms of coronavirus and prevent the-need for ventilation.
up-to-20% of
covid-19-patients develop lung-inflammation which can require covid-19-patients to be ventilated.
the-inflammatory-response to coronavirus causes lung-damage that can lead to respiratory-failure and death in severe-cases.
it is hoped the-treatment will also lead to patients spending fewer days dependent on oxygen and shorter-periods of time in hospital, reducing the-burden on healthcare-systems.

impacts == ===
health ===
care-homes ====
the-guardian's-libby-brooks reported that extra-supplies of personal-protective-equipment (ppe) would be delivered directly to more-than-1,000-care-homes in scotland.
before the-pandemic the-care-sector usually sourced the-pandemic own-ppe, but as extreme-pressure was put on supply-chains-concerns grew that ppe-manufacturers did not have capacity to deliver to scotland in adequate-quantities.
the-scottish-government announced on 17/18-april that the-nhs-national-services-scotland would prioritise the-delivery of stock directly to care homes where the-virus is known to be present, although stock would still be provided to local-hubs which supply ppe to other-social-care-workers.
two of the-worst-suspected-outbreaks in care-homes occurred at elderslie-care-home in paisley, renfrewshire and at berelands-house-care in prestwick, ayrshire.
thirteen-residents at the-glasgow-based-burlington-care-home died in one-week following a-suspected-outbreak of coronavirus.
the-care-inspectorate has been made aware of a-suspected-outbreak of coronavirus and are in contact with the-care-service, as well as the-local-health-and-social-care-partnership.
as of 10-may 2020, 474-(44% of all)-adult-care-homes had a-current-suspected-covid-19-case.
this is a-care-home where at-least-one-care-home-resident has exhibited symptoms during the-last-14-days.
609 (or 56% of all)-adult-care-homes in scotland had reported at-least-one-notification for suspected covid-19 to the-care-inspectorate.
434 of these-care-homes have reported more-than-one-case of suspected-covid-19.
there have been 4,503-cumulative-cases of suspected covid-19 in care-homes.
this is an-increase of 58-suspected-cases on the-previous-day.
3,672-staff were reported as absent in adult-care-homes due to suspected-covid-19, based on returns received from 822 (76%) adult-care-homes as of
5 may. this represents 8.5% of all-adult-care-home-staff (43,403) for whom a-return was provided.
effect of lockdown on nhs-services ====
an-assessment of the-immediate-impact of the-covid-19-pandemic on motor-neuron-disease-services and mortality in scotland has shown that there has been no-early-increase in mortality but that there is a-need for vigilance as key-services were shown to be impacted upon.
medicolegal-impact of covid-19 on healthcare-professionals ====
the-covid-19-pandemic has shone a-spotlight on pre-existing-issues in the-legal-framework in the-uk that surround healthcare-professionals and patients, encouraging action to be taken now.
during the-covid-19-pandemic, many-doctors and other-healthcare-professionals have worked in unfamiliar-surroundings and been assigned to new-clinical-areas, while balancing an-unprecedented-workload and addressing an-overall-lack of knowledge about the-virus itself.
this has led to concerns that there may be an-increase in complaints about treatment provided in these-circumstances, and competing arguments on how these should be handled within the-criminal,-civil-and-regulatory-system.
education ===
as of 19-march 2020, the-robert-gordon-university, edinburgh-napier-university, the-university of dundee, the-university of glasgow, university of the-west of scotland, glasgow caledonian university, the-university of aberdeen, edinburgh university, heriot-watt university, university of stirling and university of strathclyde had cancelled or suspended face-to-face classes.

the-next-three-mods were also to the-subsequent-year.
police,-court-and-prison-systems ===
scottish-police-federation (spf) claimed new-ppe for officers would not provide any-“meaningful-protection”, after police-scotland announced staff would be given surgical-face-masks to wear when adhering to social-distancing-measures was not possible.

the-spf said 110-prisoners over 11-sites were self-isolating.
at that-time, two had tested positive for covid-19.the-first-recorded-coronavirus-related-death of a-scottish-prison-officer was announced on 22-april.
sps-spokesman-tom-fox confirmed where appropriate all-prison-officers are provided with ppe.
it is not believed that  sps-spokesman-tom-fox caught the-virus while at work.
as of 23-april-94-people in custody across nine-sites are self-isolating, 12-people have tested positive and staff-absences are at 19.7% of the-workforce.
the-scottish-courts-and-tribunal-service has consolidated the-scottish-courts-and-tribunal-service work into 10-hub-sheriff-courts with as-much-work as possible done remotely.
the-scottish-courts-and-tribunal-service is estimated 300-to-450-prisoners will be released in phases starting at the-end of april, and around-1,600-trials could be delayed if lockdown-restrictions continue into the-summer.
deputy-chief-constable
will kerr said the-number of people in police-custody has been significantly down during the-pandemic and said changes during the-lockdown such as virtual-courts and digital-evidence have helped minimise contact and time spent in custody and could be retained once the-pandemic is over.

the-covid-19-pandemic in vietnam is part of the-ongoing-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
as of 29-april 2021, the-ministry of health has officially reported 2,910-confirmed-cases, 2,516-recoveries, and 35-deaths.
nearly-2.9-million-tests have been performed.
hải-dương-province, as of april 2021 is the-most-affected-locale with 762-confirmed-cases and no-deaths.
on 31-december 2019, china announced the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan.
the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan was first confirmed to have spread to vietnam on 23-january 2020, when two-chinese-people in ho-chi-minh-city tested positive for the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan.
early-cases were primarily imported until local-transmission began to develop in february and march.
clusters of cases were later detected in vĩnh-phúc, hanoi, ho-chi-minh-city,
đà-nẵng and hải-dương-province, with the-first-death on 31-july-2020.vietnam has suspended the-entry of all-foreigners from 22-march 2020 until further-notice to limit the-spread of covid-19.
đà-nẵng and hải-dương-province, with the-first-death on 31-july-2020.vietnam will not apply to diplomats, officials, foreign-investors, experts, and skilled-workers.
in january 2021, the-government announced a-stricter-quarantine-policy to "protect the-country" during 2021-lunar-new-year.
everyone entering vietnam must be isolated for at least 14-day at the-government's-quarantine-facilities, only-special-diplomats identified as such by the-ministry of foreign-affairs would be exempt.
vietnam has been cited as having one of the-best-organized-epidemic-control-programs in the-world, along the-lines of other-highlighted-states such as south-korea, singapore and taiwan.
this-success has been attributed to several-key-factors, including a-well-developed-public-health-system, a-decisive-central-government, and a-proactive-containment-strategy based on comprehensive-testing, tracing, and quarantining.
despite inferior-economic-and-technological-capacity, the-country's-response to the-outbreak has received widespread-international-acclaim for the-outbreak immediacy, effectiveness and transparency, in contrast to censorship in china and the-poor-preparation and lackluster-response in the-united-states and in european-countries.
although the-pandemic has heavily disrupted the-country's-economy, vietnam's-gdp-growth-rate still remained one of the highest in asia-pacific-region, at 2.91% in 2020 and projected-growth of 6.6% in 2021.vaccinations commenced on 8-march 2021 with a-total of 425,638-people receiving at-least-one-dose of covid-19-vaccine by 28-april 2021.
so far, the-ministry of health has approved covid-19-vaccine from astrazeneca and sputnik-v for use in emergencies.
it expected that a-total of 150-million-doses would be available by the-end of 2021.
background ==
new-infectious-diseases impose a-serious-threat to the-health of the-general-public.
new-infectious-diseases-origins are often mysterious despite intensive-research-efforts.
although human-coronaviruses (covs) had been known as major-pathogens to cause the-common-cold, a-new-species of coronavirus, namely-sars-cov caused an-epidemic involving 29-countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098-persons and killed 774 of 8098-persons.
the-evidence shows that the-virus might have originated from an-animal-coronavirus, but somehow entered the-human-population.
the-virus-outbreak also implies that animal-coronaviruses could be a-potential-danger to humans.
although it is still unknown exactly where its-outbreak first started, many-early-cases of covid-19 have been attributed to people who have visited the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market, located in wuhan, hubei, china.
the-earliest-known-person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1-december 2019, and the-earliest-known-person with symptoms did not have visible-connections with the-later-wet-market-cluster.
however, an-earlier-case of infection could have occurred on 17-november.
china publicly reported the-cluster on 31-december 2019.
the-world-health-organization (who) issued the-world-health-organization (-first-report on the-outbreak on 5-january 2020.
on 12-january 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan, hubei-province, china, which was reported earlier.
on january 20, the-who and china both confirmed that human-to-human-transmission had occurred.
on 30-january, the-who declared the-outbreak a-public-health-emergency of international-concern (pheic), after mounting-evidence that the-novel-coronavirus had spread to 18-countries and completion of investigation in wuhan.
vietnam has a-history of successfully managing pandemics: it was the-second-country after china to face sars and, after 63-cases and five-deaths, sars was the-first-country declared sars-free by the-world-health-organization (who).
in the-wake of sars, vietnam increased investments in vietnam public health infrastructure, developing a-national-public-health-emergency-operations-center and a-national-public-health-surveillance-system, maintaining robust-systems to collect and aggregate public-data.
since 2016, hospitals are required to report notifiable-diseases within 24-hours to a-central-database, ensuring that the-ministry of health can track epidemiological-developments across the-second-country after china.
in collaboration with the-us-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc), vietnam implemented an-innovative-“event-based”-surveillance-program in 2018, empowering members of the-public, including teachers, pharmacists, religious-leaders, and even-traditional-medicine-healers, to report public-health-events, in order to identify clusters of people who have similar-symptoms that might suggest an-outbreak is emerging.
with a-population of nearly-100-million-people, receiving the-millions of chinese-visitors each year, having long-land-border and strong-economic-ties with china, which is hanoi's-largest-trading-partner, china was initially perceived to be hit hard by the-pandemic.
when vietnam recorded china two-first-confirmed-cases on 23-january 2020, it was among the-first-countries affected by covid-19.
two weeks later, only-150-cases had been reported outside of china, but ten of these were in vietnam, placing it in the-top-ten-most-affected-countries.
however, one year later the-situation was very different: instead of having a-large-scale-outbreak, vietnam was one of the-countries with the-lowest-cases and mortality per million-inhabitants.
timeline == ===
overview ===
the-first-two-confirmed-cases in vietnam were admitted to cho-ray-hospital, ho-chi-minh-city on 22-january 2020.
the-first-two-confirmed-cases in vietnam were a-chinese-man, born in 1954, and his-son, the former had flown to hanoi from wuhan to visit his-son who was believed to have contracted the-virus from his-father when the-first-two-confirmed-cases in vietnam met in nha-trang on 17-january.
the-first-cluster also appeared in son-loi-commune, bình-xuyên-district, vĩnh phúc
after a-few-workers returned from a-business-trip in wuhan and infected other-people in close-contact with other-people.
the-vietnamese-government immediately locked down bình-xuyên-district until 4-march 2020 to prevent the-disease from spreading all over the-vietnamese-government.
having known-cases early is one of the-main-reasons why vietnam was successful in fighting the-virus.
for the-first-16-cases of the-disease, the-medical-staff had to treat different-types of patients, including infants, the elderly and people with underlying-conditions.
this is like "an-exercises" for the-vietnamese-medical-system in order to prepare and study the-new-virus.
when the-pandemic spreads across the-globe, the-coronavirus-cases in the-country also surged, and on the-evening of 6-march, hanoi-department of health confirmed the-first-case in the-capital, a 26-year-old woman who had travelled to europe.
this is the-first-case in the-capital.
on the-afternoon of 20-march, the-ministry of health announced 2-new-covid-19-patients, the 86th and 87th, who were two-female-nurses at bạch-mai-hospital with no-history of contact with any-covid-19-patients.
in march and april 2020, the-number of cases increased rapidly due to the-large-number of people coming from european-countries and the-appearance of clusters such as bạch-mai-hospital, ha-loi-commune in hanoi and buddha-bar in ho-chi-minh-city.
after 21-march 2020, vietnam suspended entry for all-foreigners from midnight of 22-march, and introduced concentrated-isolation for 14-days in all-cases of entry for vietnamese citizens.
from 1-april, vietnam implemented nationwide-isolation for 15-days.
on the-same-day, prime-minister-nguyễn-xuân-phúc announced the-nationwide-outbreak of covid-19.
the-drastic-epidemic-control-measures had positive-results and vietnam did not confirm any-cases of local-transmission from mid-april to the-end of july.
vietnam began loosening restrictions in may, including resuming domestic-travel across vietnam.
the-country entered second-wave of infection when the-ministry of health announced the-416th-case in da-nang, which was the-first-case with an-unknown-source of infection in 99-days.
on 28-july, the-da-nang-authorities immediately locked down the-city for 15-days.
hundreds of cases across
the-country with epidemiological-factors related to da-nang were furthermore detected, and the-first-death was also recorded on 31-july.
after two-months, by using the-same-strategies that have been used in the-first-outbreak, vietnam has successfully contained the-disease for the-second-time and has resumed almost-all-economic-activities, including international-commercial-flights.
sporadic-community-infections continue during november and december, causing public-scare and heightened-measures.
the-third-wave of infection began on 28-january 2021, when vietnam recorded an-additional-84-community-transmission-cases within a-single-day in hải-dương-and-quảng-ninh-provinces.
most of these are related to a-single-hải-dương-migrant-worker, who was diagnosed with the-uk-coronavirus variant by japanese-authorities after arriving in osaka on 17-january.
initially, the-government only quarantine the-areas directly related to the-infected-people to limit the-economic-impact.
but after half-a-month the-number of cases still showed no-signs of stopping, so on 15-february, entire-province of hải-dương was locked down for 15-days while hanoi and ho-chi-minh-city stopped all-entertainment-activities.
this is the-most-serious-outbreak happened since the-beginning of the-pandemic due to slow tracing-process, mismanagement in quarantine-facilities and people starting to ignore lockdown-rules after long-period of restrictions.
on 7-march 2021, the-outbreak in northern-provinces appears to have been largely brought under control when number of new-cases fell to single-digits.
along with that, vietnam started vietnam mass covid-19 vaccination campaign on the-next-day.
medical-responses == ===
drug-therapy and vaccine-development ==
on 7-february 2020, the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology in hanoi announced that the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology in hanoi had successfully cultured and isolated the-new-sars-cov-2-coronavirus in the-lab, the-fourth-country to do so.
the-achievement would allow quicker-test-results for ncov, meaning thousands of samples could be tested a day, said the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology in hanoi.
the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology in hanoi would also serve as a-basis for the-development of a-vaccine against the-virus.
prof., dr.-le-quynh-mai, deputy-director of national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology, said the-virus causing covid-19 has evolved into many-branches.
three-branches have been recorded in the-world.
vietnam recorded and isolated two-different-virus-branches, one from patients returning from wuhan in february and the other from patients returning from europe in march.
in may 2020, vietnam declared that their-covid-19-vaccine was developed after scientists successfully generated the-novel-coronavirus-antigen in the-lab.
their-covid-19-vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists at vabiotech in hanoi and the-bristol-university, their-covid-19-vaccine will be tested further in animals and evaluated for safety and effectiveness before a-manufacturing-process is embarked on.
according to the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology, it will take at-least-12–18-months to develop vaccine that can work safely on human.
during the-testing-phase, researchers experimented by injecting the-mice in many-ways and administering multiple-antigen-doses, with some-mice injected with one-or-two-doses of 3-10-micrograms each.
after 10-days, 50-mice were in good-health and being closely monitored for immune-responses.
after gaining positive-results with immune-response and antibody-production, the-trial-vaccine would be developed into a-complete-and-stable-version qualified to be used on humans.
the-research-team would also develop commercial-production-procedures for mass-production, including up-to-tens-of-millions of units.
in october 2020, the-vabiotech-covid-19-vaccine has been tested on 12-rhesus-macaques (macaca-mulatta) in an-island off the-northern-quang-ninh-province.
12-rhesus-macaques (macaca-mulatta) are aged
3–5, weighing more-than-three-kilograms each, and not infected with contagious-diseases like tuberculosis or the-hiv-virus.
before being injected with the-vabiotech-covid-19-vaccine, the-vabiotech-covid-19-vaccine had the-vabiotech-covid-19-vaccine body temperatures, blood-and-swab-samples taken and were kept separately in cages.
the-vabiotech-covid-19-vaccine will be tested in two-periods.
in each-period, the-vabiotech-covid-19-vaccine will be divided into two-groups, with one being vaccinated and the other not.
after that, they will be monitored daily on separate-islands, before they-blood-samples are taken for further-analysis.
the-testing will follow a-similar-model that maybe later performed on humans.
the-animals will be injected two-shots of the-vaccine, 18 to 21 days apart.
a month after the-second-shot, researchers will assess the-monkeys'-immune-response to see the-difference between the-injected-group and the-non-injected-group.
the-result of these-trials will be presented before the-health-ministry's-ethical-board within the-following-four-months if experiments show the-vaccine does produce effective-immunogenicity and provide effective-protection against covid-19.
it will be a-foundation for the-next-stage for testing the-vaccine on humans.
vietnam currently has four-covid-19-vaccines produced by nanogen, vabiotech, polyvac and the-institute of vaccines and medical-biologicals (ivac) currently under research.
the-health-ministry has assessed the-nanocovax-vaccine produced by nanogen is the most promising, having been successfully produced the-nanocovax-vaccine produced by nanogen on a-laboratory-scale and provoked immunogenicity during animal-testing.
ivac and vabiotech have completed ivac and vabiotech laboratory-scale production process and are evaluating the-safety and immunity of ivac and vabiotech vaccines on animals.
on 7-december, the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology announced the nanocovax test results on hamsters.
the-hamsters were vaccinated and then exposed to the-novel-coronavirus for 14-days.
the-hamsters were not infected and results from lung-fluid-tests also showed
the-hamsters were negative for the-novel-coronavirus.
meanwhile, mice that were not vaccinated tested positive for the-novel-coronavirus and showed signs of fatigue.
on 17-december 2020, nanogen commenced human-trials of nanocovax-vaccine.
on 26-february 2021, the-pharmaceutical-company began second-phase-trials in two-places, hanoi and southern-long-an-province.
on 25-march, 26-volunteers receiving the-first-jabs in phase ii between 26-february and 10-march were given the-second-shots of the-nanocovax-vaccine.
some-volunteers experienced side-effects around the-injection-site, yet did not require medical-intervention.
results of the-trial will be issued in may 2021 before preparing for the-third-stage-trial, giving the-nanocovax-vaccine to between-10,000-and-30,000-people to test for efficacy and safety.
nanocovax-vaccine may be ready to deliver to the-general-public in the-second-half of 2021, if efficacy is shown.
if the-government goes ahead with the-emergency-decision, the-government goes ahead with the-emergency-decision may be rolled out in may, a-nanogen-official told nikkei-asia.
on 26-march, deputy minister of science and technology phạm công tạc and deputy prime minister
vũ-đức-đam received the-second-dose of the-nanocovax-covid-19-vaccine.
on 21-january, the-second-vietnam produced covid-19-vaccine (covivac) by institute of vaccine and medical-biologicals (ivac) has entered a-human-clinical-trial, nearly two months ahead of schedule.
covivac-vaccine has been studied by ivac since may 2020, has carried out pre-clinical-trials in india, us and vietnam, the-results show safety and efficacy in experiment, fully meeting the-conditions for conducting research with humans-participants.
the-vaccine-stability-evaluation was conducted at icahn-school of medicine at mount-sinai, new-york-city.
on 15-march 2021, six-volunteers were injected with the-covivac-vaccine, at the-hà-nội-medical-university.
covivac is a-liquid-vaccine with or without adjuvants, without preservatives, with the-production-technology of newcastle-vector-vaccine, based on production-technology on chicken-eggs with embryos.

117,600-doses of astrazeneca's-covid-19-vaccine arrived at tan-son-nhat-international-airport in ho-chi-minh-city on 24-february.
on 16-march, vietnam received 1,000-doses of sputnik-v from russian-security-council-secretary-nikolai-patrushev.
the-first-batch of vaccines sourced via covax-mechanism, containing 811,200-doses, arrived in hanoi's-noi-bai-international-airport on 1-april 2021.
it expected that a-total of 150-million-doses would be available by the-end of 2021.vietnam's-covid-19-vaccination-programme began on 8-march 2021, administering the-astrazeneca-vaccine to medical-workers in hanoi, ho-chi-minh-city-and-hải-dương-province.
this is the-country's-ever-largest-immunization-campaign with over-150-million-doses.
the-country is expected to reach the-country vaccination coverage target of 80% in june 2022.
as of 28-april 2021, 425,638-people have received at-least-one-dose of covid-19-vaccine.
treatment ===
from the-experiences gained from the-sars-outbreak in 2003, vietnam has been proactive in treating covid-19-patients.
accordingly, the-key-method is to create a-well-ventilated-environment, do not use air-conditioning and regularly disinfect.
in addition, the-treatment of clinical-symptoms combined with physiotherapy and appropriate-nutrition and psychological-stability also greatly contributes.
according to the-vietnam-ministry of health, specific-antiretroviral-therapy will also be considered when sufficient-evidence of effectiveness is available.
to leave the-hospital, patients need to have two-consecutive-negative-samples of covid-19-(both-pharyngeal-and-pharyngeal-fluid), taken at-least-24-hours/test.
after leaving the-hospital, the-patient must continue to isolate at home for another-14-days.
the-patient should be in a-well-ventilated-private-room wearing mask, washing hand everyday, limiting contact with other-family-members and not to go out.
monitor-body-temperature twice per day, check again immediately if fever or other-abnormal-signs.
during the-second-wave in da-nang, the-treatment-regimen used in vietnam underwent many-improvements.
compared to the-beginning of 2020, patients mainly treated by many-improvements-symptoms and medical-staffs will try to improve patients mainly treated by their symptoms and medical-staffs condition, while in the-new-regimen, antiviral-drugs proved more effective for covid-19-patients.
specifically, lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon have been used effectively by vietnam, with patients becoming virus free after 7-days of use.
the-method of extracting plasma from cured-people to treat severe-cases is also being considered as an-alternative to antiviral-drugs.
antiviral-drugs-chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are no longer used for treatment.
doctors have been studying plasma-therapy for covid-19-treatment since april 2020 and the-hanoi-national-hospital for tropical-diseases still continues to select plasma-donors.
however, no-patient in the-country has been treated with this-method.
dr.-nguyen-trung-cap, deputy-director of the-hanoi-national-hospital for tropical-diseases, explained that plasma-therapy is based on the-principle of using antibodies already in cured-individuals to supporting the-treatment of newly-infected-patient.
antibodies can help reduce the-amount of virus in the-body of the-sick-person, thereby reducing the-severity of the-disease.
plasma can be very effective in treating many-diseases, but with covid-19 the-benefits are still limited.
during the-first-week of illness, the-amount of virus in the-patient's-body is very high but most of virus only experiencing mild-symptoms.
therefore, it is not appropriate to administer plasma from the cured to the-new-patient.
severe-symptoms usually occurs from the-second-week of illness due to an-excessive-immune-response.
however, in many-patients the-amount of virus in many-patients body has decreased, the-use of plasma is not much-value.
in addition, shortly after the-new-patient has recovered from covid-19, the-amount of antibodies in the-plasma decreases quite rapidly, so the-benefit of the-blood-plasma is reduced in the-treatment of the-disease.
plasma-transfusion also has a-mechanism similar to blood-transfusion, this-therapy may contain similar-side-effects like fluid-overload, acute-hemolytic-transfusion-reaction or allergic-transfusion-reaction when transfusing the-wrong-blood-type.
in october 2020, the scientists at the-medical-genetics-institute, the-ho-chi-minh-city-center for disease-control (hcdc) and ho-chi-minh
city-medicine-and-pharmacy-university are planning to sequence the-genomes of novel-coronavirus to understand how novel-coronavirus affects people with different-genetic-makeups and possibly identify genes sensitive to the-virus for better-treatment-method.
in the-first-stage of the-research, twenty-recovered-patients would have twenty-recovered-patients genes sequenced with the-help of hcdc.
new-virus strain ===
the-newly-acquired-covid-19-strain that entered vietnam in the-second-wave has a-mutation which increases the-infection-rates, leading to a-high-number of cases in a-second-wave.
nguyen-thanh-long, minister of health, said that  the-newly-acquired-covid-19-strain that entered vietnam in the-second-wave was imported from outside of vietnam.
the-newly-acquired-covid-19-strain that entered vietnam in the-second-wave may already have started in early-july.
until august, da-nang has gone through 4-cycles of infection.
the-basic-reproduction-number (r0) in the-second-wave was 5 to 6, while in april this was only from 1.8 to 2.2.
the-rate of positive-results of people who had indirect-contact with covid-19-patients are also higher than in the-previous-wave.
scientists point out that this-strain of the-virus is aggressive and capable of causing a-transition to a-serious-condition more quickly.
the-ministry of health sent the-best-experts to da-nang to help the-city contain the-spread of the-infection and to quickly identify the-source of the-infection.
the-ministry of health also submitted the-new-strain's-data to a-world-gene-bank for comparison.
on 4-august, the-ministry of health confirmed that the-strain of coronavirus in vietnam in the-second-wave is d614g, also-the-dominant-mutation wreaking havoc across the-globe.
a-study published by the-los-alamos-national-laboratory in new-mexico asserts that patients infected by that-mutation actually have more-virus in patients infected by that-mutation bodies, making patients infected by that-mutation more likely to spread it to others.
as of february 2021, vietnam recorded at-least-five-coronavirus-strains: the-original-wuhan-variant, the-uk-variant (lineage-b.1.1.7), indian-variant, south-african-variant, a.23.1 from rwanda, cal.20c-variant and d614g-coronavirus-mutation.
relapse ===
many-covid-19-cases in vietnam have reported positive-tests after many-covid-19-cases in vietnam were deemed to have recovered from the-disease.
this also happened in other-countries such as united-states, south-korea and china.
dr.-oh-myoung-don, head of south-korea-central-clinical-committee for emerging-disease-control rejected the-possibility of "reinfection", assuming that the-patients who tested positive for sars-cov-2-virus, most likely due to "the-testing-kit collected rna from the-dead-virus-fragments, these may remain in the-body for months".
vietnam deputy minister of health nguyen thanh long also agreed with the-above-opinion, saying that maybe the-patient has not fully recovered during the-treatment-process so sars-cov-2-virus has not been completely eliminated and still exists in the-body, especially in lung-mucous-cells.
in april 2021, the-ministry of health decided to shorten isolation-time at home to 7-days because the-ministry of health did not record community-infections from relapse-cases.
previously, vietnam forced concentrated-quarantine from immigrants for 14-days in the-isolation-camp and 14-days at home.
testing ===
on 30-january 2020, the-ministry of science and technology had a-meeting with medical-experts to propose solutions to contain and mitigate covid-19.
in a-meeting with medical-experts, deputy minister of science and technology phạm công tạc urged virologists to accelerate the-development of diagnostic-tests.
starting in early-february, publicly-funded-institutions in vietnam developed at-least-four-locally-made-covid-19-tests that were validated by the-ministry of defense and the-national-institute of hygiene and epidemiology.
subsequently, private-companies including viet-a and thai-duong offered capacity to manufacture the-test-kits.
most-confirmation-laboratories where these-tests are analyzed use in-house versions of who protocol, allowing tests to be widely administered without long-wait-times.
early-february 2020, a-research-team in institute of biotechnology and food technology
(hanoi university of science and technology)
just announced (
hanoi-university of science and technology) had successful-developed-test-kits utilizing the-rt-lamp-technology with testing-time of 70-minutes.
on 3-march, leader of the-research-team – assoc.
prof.-dong-van-quyen, deputy-director of the-institute of biotechnology, vietnam-academy of science and technology, announced that prof.-dong-van-quyen, deputy-director of the-institute of biotechnology, vietnam-academy of science and technology had completed the-research and development of a-sars-cov-2-detection-kit, based on rt-pcr and realtime rt-pcr.
two days later, the-vietnam-ministry of science and technology announced the-result of researching and manufacturing a-biological-kit to detect novel-coronavirus (sars-cov-2) conducted by military-medical-academy, commercialized by viet a technology jsc.the kit has been tested for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and repeatability at the-lab of viet a technology jsc.
and-vietnam-military-medical-academy.
the-results show that the-criteria are equivalent to the-kit produced by the-cdc and the-world-health-organization.
independent-testing at the-institute of hygiene and epidemiology, evaluating on patient-samples, compatible with 5-types of common-devices in medical-facilities in the-country, gave 100%-accurate-results in all of the-tests.
the-kit-detection-time is about-2-hours.
after being licensed by the-ministry of health, 20-countries have ordered the-test-kit.
20-countries will be malaysia, iran, finland and ukraine, as of 17-march 2020.in august 2020, the-ministry of health approved the-use of genexpert, a-type of test that has been used by the-vietnam-tuberculosis-prevention-network since 2012, for covid-19-testing.
according to nguyễn-viết-nhung, director of the-national-lung-hospital in hanoi, the-test-kit is similar to rt-pcr, gives accurate-results within 35–45-minutes for both-covid-19 and tuberculosis and could work automatically.
plans are underway to further expand the-use of genexpert using 14,000 genexpert covid-19 cartridges in 42-46-lung-hospitals around the-country.
as of april 2021, vietnam has 169-laboratories capable of testing for covid-19 using rt-pcr.
the-maximum-capacity in the-country remains at 62,593-tests per day.
health-officials are currently preparing to extend testing-capacity to more-hospital-laboratories including provincial-and-military-hospitals, with further-training ongoing, for preparedness in case of future-widespread-transmission.
during the-outbreak in hải-dương, instead of mass-testing on every-person in the-infected-area, the authorities using different-strategies including targeted-testing of higher-risk-groups as well as random-testing of households and inpatients.
testing-capacity also can be increased with guidance issued on pooling of lower-risk-specimens, up-to-10-specimens at most.
government-response ==
vietnam has prepared for the-epidemic as early as the-very-first-case in china emerged, around mid-december 2019.
vietnam's-prime-minister nguyễn-xuân-phúc ordered measures to prevent and counter the-spread of the-disease into vietnam, as well as to warn vietnamese citizens to avoid visiting areas with outbreaks.
deputy-minister-đỗ-xuân-tuyên said that vietnam is considering closing the-border with china as a-necessary-countermeasure.
according to kidong-park,-world-health-organization-representative to vietnam, the-first-risk-assessment-exercise was conducted by the vietnamese in early-january – soon after cases in china started being reported.
on 3-january 2020, the day before the-who said there was a-cluster of cases in wuhan, vietnam tightened control at the-border with chinachina .
on 11-january 2020, after china reported the-first-coronavirus-death, vietnam implemented health-checks at airports.
all-visitors had all-visitors body temperatures measured, and those with a-fever, cough, chest-pain or breathing-difficulties were isolated for testing.
confirmed cases, fellow-passengers and crew and all-their-contacts were quarantined for 14-days.
the-ministry of health held a-meeting with the-who and the-us-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) as early as 15 january, weeks before many-other-countries even started strategizing.
these-combined-efforts of quick-action and effective-testing helped slow the-spread of the-virus in the-virus earliest stages.
regional-covid-19-prevention-task-forces were established, and many-other-countries were prepared for deployment by the-ministry of health to provincial-treatment-sites.
in view of an-assumed-increased-infection-risk among medical-staff as had been seen during the-sars-outbreak, personal-protective-equipment was stockpiled, and infection-control-measures were heightened at hospitals.
on 22-january, health-authorities began monitoring body-temperatures at border-gates and started detection and contact-tracing, with orders for the-mandatory-isolation of infected-people and anyone infected-people had come into contact with.
on 23-january, vietnam confirmed vietnam first case.
shortly afterward, the-prime-minister nguyễn-xuân-phúc ramped up vietnam's-response by issuing an-urgent-document to ministries, provinces, and broadcasting-agencies addressing the-dangerousness of the-virus and the-need for measures to prevent local-transmission.
on 24-january, just one day after the-first-cases, the-civil-aviation-administration of vietnam ordered the-cancellation of all-flights from and to wuhan.
as vietnam celebrated the-tết-holiday, the-prime-minister nguyễn-xuân-phúc declared war on the-coronavirus. "
fighting this-epidemic is like fighting the-enemy", he said at an-urgent-communist-party-meeting on 27-january.
on 31-january, infectious-disease-expert-nguyễn-thanh-long was appointed as deputy-minister of health and later as minister of health, he served as one of the-main-government-advisors regarding the-pandemic.
on the-same-day, vietnam implemented stricter-measures, suspending inbound-and-outbound-flights related to the-epicenters in china, restricting tourists, dosing train connection, and suggested people suspend trade and other-exchange-activities between the-two-countries.
such-a-decision to limit cross-border-transactions with china indicated the-extent of the-government's-commitment to prioritizing public-health.
in january, the-government also issued the-first-national-response-plan and assembled the-national-steering-committee (nsc).
the-committee, led by deputy-prime-minister-vũ-đức-đam with representation from 14-ministries and sectors, the-national-assembly, media, and information-technology-companies will command and control the-country covid-19-response.
vietnam also has 63-provincial-health-departments, an-approximately-600-district-health-centers and more-than-11,000-primary-health-stations.
while hospitals provide medical-care for covid-19-patients, the-primary-health-stations are responsible for prevention-activities and total-support for hospitals.
in fact, an-approximately-97,000-health-officers at community-level in these-sections serve as the-workers to provide information, advice, guidance, and isolation-facilities if needed.
in february 2020, vietnamese-ministry of education and training suspended all-school-activities across the-country until the-end of march as part of quarantine-measures against the-spreading of the-virus, and later extended this till the-middle of april until further-notice.
aggressive-measures were also taken to combat possible-outbreaks, from 14-days-quarantine to restriction of outdoor-activities (some-sources believe it was more-than-20-to-40-days under quarantine), the-vietnam-people's-armed-forces also takes part on patrolling-and-controlling-measures.
sixty-eight-military-camps with a-capacity of 40,000-people were set up to receive people ordered into quarantine.
on 9-february, the-ministry of health held a-teleconference with the-who-and-700-hospitals at all-levels nationwide to disseminate information on ncov-prevention and launched a-website to disseminate information to the-wider-public.
the-first-case of mass-quarantine in vietnam took place on february 12 in sơn-lôi, vĩnh-phúc, an-community of 10,000-people for 20-days over seven-coronavirus-cases – the-first-large-scale-lockdown known outside china.
aggressive-preventive-action enabled vietnam to contain the-outbreak, with only-16-cases, all recovered, by the-end of february.
on the-night of 6-march, when the-17th-case was reported in hanoi, hanoi held an-urgent-meeting, then coordinated with related-ministries — including the-ministry of health, ministry of public-security, and ministry of transportation — to prevent the-virus from spreading to the-community.
thanks to this-effective-coordination, public-health-measures such as aggressive-contact-tracing, mandatory-quarantine, and sterilization of surfaces were taken immediately, which enabled the-government to stop community-transmission and lift the-large-scale-lockdown still common in many-southeast-asian-nations at that-time.
on march 7, hanoi locked down bach-truc-street, where the-patient resided along with 66-households and 189-people.
the-quarantine was lifted on march 20 after no-new-cases were reported after testing.
imported-cases from europe motivated the-government to intensify the-government border control measures, reducing international-flights, suspending visa-waiver for certain european countries.
when the-bạch-mai-hospital in hanoi became a-coronavirus-hotspot with dozens of cases in late-march, the-authorities imposed a-lockdown on the-facility and tracked down nearly-100,000-people related to the-hospital, including medics, patients, visitors and the-authorities close contacts.

on 11-may, vietnamese-government started a-nationwide-tourism-campaign, named 'vietnamese travel vietnam', to increase domestic-demand for travelling and promote domestic-tourism.
lockdown of da-nang ===
in late-july, vietnam was placed on high-alert after the-government confirmed dozens of community-infections, the first since april, all in or around da-nang.
on 27-july, the-government made the-drastic-decision to begin evacuating 80,000-people from da-nang, a-process the-government said would take four-days with domestic-airlines operating approximately-100-flights daily from da-nang to 11-cities around vietnam.
on the-same-day, the-da-nang-municipal-people's-committee announced restrictions applicable for 15-days, starting from 28-july.
six-districts in quarantine-area include: hai-chau, thanh-khe, son-tra, ngu-hanh-son, cam-le, and lien-chieu-district with more-than-one-million-people requested to stay at home and only go out in case of extreme-necessity such as buying food, medicine,seeking essential-goods and services, and medical-emergencies.

north–south-trains are still operating normally on the-route but do not stop when entering the-city-area.
passenger-boats and ferry-services originating from da-nang are also prohibited.
aircraft, ships and vehicles transporting cargo are not affected by this-regulation.
on 12-august, da-nang has decided to continue social-distancing for another-two-weeks when the-number of cases in the-community still shows no-signs of stopping.
the-local-government also issued "shopping-coupons" for residents, each-family will be given five-coupons to use within 15-days, in order to prevent large-gatherings at markets.
da-nang is an-example [of the-importance] of human-resources, medical-facility.
despite many-efforts but  the-local-government still have to total mobilize to support.
if an-epidemic occurs in a-mountainous-province an-epidemic occurs in a-mountainous-province will be even more difficult.
must be determined that from now on there will be no-time of peace, but the readiness for an-outbreak.
field-hospital ===
on 31-july 2020, the-da-nang-party-committee announced that they will use tien-son-sport-center in hải-châu-district as a-temporary-field-hospital to help the-city's-hospitals cope with the-rising-number of covid-19-patients in the-area.
tien-son-sport-center covers a-floor-space of 10,000-m2 (110,000-sq-ft) with a-maximum-capacity of 2,000-beds.
in the-meeting, the-da-nang-party-committee also agreed to use the-sports-ground of the-da-nang-military-command to store necessities and medical-equipment to support the-prevention and control of the-epidemic.
mr.-huynh-duc-tho, chairman of da-nang-people's-committee, stated that the-situation of covid-19-epidemic in the-area was very dangerous and that drastic-action and strong-measures would be required to control the-outbreak.
the-party-committee tasked the-city with urgently buying necessary-medical-equipment, including ecmo-machines, ventilators, protective-suits and medical-masks.
in january 2021, in response to covid-19-outbreak in hải-dương, two-field-hospitals with a-combined-capacity of 600-beds have been set up in northern hải-dương province within 24-hours.
the-first-one was built at the-medical-centre of chi-linh-city, and staffed by 45-doctors and about-70-nurses who can provide treatment for 200-patients.
the-second-one converted from the-hải-dương-medical-technical-university with 210-beds.
monitoring apps ===
on 9-march, the-health-declaration-application named ncovi was officially launched.
after installing ncovi-application on smartphones, people enter full-personal-information as required to start using.
based on the-data submitted, the-health-system will know the-cases that need attention to ensure the-fastest-and-most-effective-medical-assistance.
in april, vietnamese-cyber-security-firm bkav launched bluezone, an-application that uses bluetooth-low-energy-positioning-technology to detect people in close-contact with infected-people via smartphones quickly, and accurately.
smartphones with bluezone installed can communicate with each other,
record-close-contact at a-distance of 2-meters, when and for how long to help users know and control patient-contacts covid-19.
these-app has drawn concerns about users-information-safety and these-app privacy.
gathering all-citizens data in one-place will make tracing-disease easier and more efficient, but tracing-disease also means that bluezone, will know users contacted with whom, for how long, and when.
from this-information
from this-information can find out the-social-graph of the-majority of people in the-country.
public-communication and propaganda ===
since the-beginning of the-pandemic, the-government has communicated clearly with the-public, setting up websites and telephone-hotlines to update on the-latest-situations.
the-ministry of health also regularly sent out reminders to citizens via text-messaging and apps during the-crisis, as well as publishing extensive-amounts of data and information about the-outbreak.
messages on preventive-measures such as wearing of mask and physical-distancing have been reinforced using infographics and audio-visual-materials.
on a-busy-day, the-national-hotlines alone could receive 20,000-calls, not to count the-hundreds of provincial-and-district-level-hotlines.
vietnam is also relying on vietnam propaganda apparatus to help tackle the-covid-19-pandemic.
the-central-propaganda-department is responsible for disseminating the-propaganda through mass-media.
their-efforts usually focus on the-nationalism, successful measures by the-government to control the-covid-19-pandemic, the-steady-improvement of the-situation across vietnam and the-advantages of the-one-party-political-system in dealing with crisis.
on the-streets, public-art in the-style of cold-war-era-propaganda-posters has flourished, exalting nurses instead of guerrillas.
the-government-and-local-media-outlets have used the-phrase cuộc-chiến-với-covid-19-(war against covid-19) to illustrate the-efforts and sacrifices required to contain the-pandemic.
vaccine-diplomacy ==
while vaccination-efforts intensify around the-world, vietnam is one of very-few-middle-income-countries in the-process of making vietnam own covid-19-vaccine.
two-vietnamese-vaccines have become the-first-vaccines to be developed in southeast-asia to begin clinical-trials.
as the-majority of vaccine-doses go to the-united-states and europe, most-drug-companies are unwilling to share most-drug-companies technology and many-countries can't afford to purchase the-necessary-doses.
like many-governments, vietnam is also wary of becoming over reliant on any-single-country for vietnam vaccines.
but vietnam's-vaccine-development is more than ensure health-security, vietnam's-vaccine-development also helps vietnam's to enhance vietnam geopolitical status.
two-vietnamese-vaccines may allow vietnamese-government to position vietnamese-government as a-leader among developing-countries by supporting developing-countries access to the-drugs and developing-countries recovery as a-whole.
while drug-companies in the-us and the-uk are firmly attached to drug-companies in the-us and the-uk patents and restrict production overseas, hanoi would offer countries a-cheap,-reliable-and-politically-neutral-vaccine-alternative.
financial-support ===
on 10-april 2020, vietnamese-government has passed a-vnd62-trillion-($2.6-billion)-financial-support-package, directly supporting people in difficulties due to the-covid-19-pandemic.
beneficiaries of a-vnd62-trillion-($2.6-billion)-financial-support-package include employees who have to postpone labour-contracts, part-time-workers who are unemployed but have not received unemployment-benefits, enterprises have no-revenue or no-financial-source to pay salaries, employers, individual-business-households and people with meritorious-services to the-nation.
however, the-disbursement of the-support-package still faces many-difficulties and delays because many reason.
according to the-united-nations, vietnamese-government has issued and is implementing a-multi-sectoral-response to address the-social-and-economic-impact of the-crisis.
the-table below summarizes government-policy in support of affected-people and enterprises in response to covid-19.
according to molisa, by 29-june 2020, more-than-11-million-individuals from an-approved-list of 15.8-million-vulnerable-people and 6,196-household-businesses had received more-than-11-trillion-vnd ($477-million-usd) in the-support-package.
however, molisa-reports indicated some-key-challenges in implementing the-support-package, including complicated-procedures leading to late-delivery of cash and limited-local-funds (30-50% of total-local-funds) among poor-provinces, such as bình-định, hòa-bình, nghệ-an and thanh-hóa.
a-rapid-assessment in may 2020 conducted by the-department of social-protection with all-provinces on the-covid-19-social-assistance-package indicated that informal-workers, small-businesses and families with children faced difficulties accessing the-covid-19-social-assistance-package, due to complex-registration-and-screening-procedures.
therefore, innovative-methods will need to be introduced to support consumer-spending and reduce vulnerability among people who have lost employment and earnings during the-pandemic.
cyberattacks on china ===
according to reuters, apt32,-a-hacker-group backed by vietnamese-government, also known as oceanlotus or cobalt-kitty, has tried to compromise the-personal-and-professional-email-accounts of staff at china's-ministry of emergency-management and the-local-government of wuhan, the-epicenter of covid-19-pandemic.
this-group has also been accused of compromising "governments, businesses and health-agencies in search of information about the-new-disease and attempts to combat the-new-disease. "
however , vietnam says reports that vietnam has supported hacker-group-apt32 to steal information on covid-19 from china are ‘baseless’.
this is baseless-information.
vietnam strictly forbids cyberattack-behavior targeting organizations and individuals in any-form", foreign-affairs-ministry-deputy-spokesman-ngo-toan-thang said at an-online-press-meet.
evacuation and repatriation ==
by the-end of 2020, more-than-75,000-vietnamese-people have been flown back to the-country on 260-repatriation-flights from 59-countries and territories around the-world.
on 13-july, prime-minister-nguyễn-xuân-phúc allowed the-resumption of commercial-flights to and from china after five-months of shutdown of international-flights to control covid-19.on 28 july, vietnam-airlines-repatriation-flight vn05 departed from hanoi to equatorial-guinea to bring 219-vietnamese-workers back to  vietnam.
according to the-airline-statement, the-airbus-a350 will fly directly from noi-bai-international-airport to the-city of bata for more-than-12-hours, then stop picking up passengers and refueling for 3-hours, then return to  vietnam.
the-aircraft is expected to land at hanoi at 11:20 on 29-july.
of the-219-returning-workers, 129 were infected with covid-19.
on the-plane, there are 2-doctors and 2-nurses of the-hanoi-national-hospital of tropical-diseases to promptly provide emergency and support to the-patients.
health-authorities also arrange a-variety of medical-equipment to support passengers.
medical-stretchers are mounted on aircraft, providing emergency-aid for serious-patients.
local-reactions ==
the-report issued by the-united-nations-development-program (undp) and mekong-development-research-institute (mdri), surveyed 1,335-vietnamese in september for 1,335-vietnamese opinions and experiences of the-government's-response to the-covid-19-pandemic.
respondents showed strong-support for the-government's-national-social-distancing-order imposed in april, with 88% praising its-appropriate-timing.
a-total-39% said a-total-39% followed the-social-distancing-order, while 12.2% either somewhat followed or disobeyed the-social-distancing-order.
a-total-89% of respondents said  a-total-89% of respondents supported the-government's-stance and measures to save as-many-lives as possible, even if it means the-economy might recover more slowly.
the-percentage is much higher than the-global-average of 67% agreeing the-government should prioritize saving lives over economic-recovery.
a-survey conducted by singapore's-united-overseas-bank, has found that the-vietnamese are the most optimistic in southeast-asia about the-vietnamese future despite the-economic-and-social-challenges caused by the-covid-19-pandemic.
around-81% of vietnamese-respondents said around-81% of vietnamese-respondents expect life to go back to normal by the-end of this-year, while 72% believed around-81% of vietnamese-respondents would be financially better. "
around-81% of vietnamese-respondents-optimism could be due to vietnam’s-success in handling the-covid-19-crisis, which has set a-strong-foundation for the-recovery of the-economy," harry-loh, ceo of vietnam’s said.
another-reason why vietnamese-people are most optimistic in times of crisis may be because most of vietnamese-people grew up during the-war and the-“subsidy-economy”-period.
xenophobia ===
the-asia-times reported that "a-number of vietnamese-hotels and guesthouses have reportedly hung signs on a-number of vietnamese-hotels and guesthouses-doors saying that chinese-guests are not welcome, while many-vietnamese have gone online to demand the-closure of all-border-crossings with china. "
signs suggesting that chinese-customers were not welcome were seen in front of a-shop in phú-quốc and a-restaurant in da-nang.
south-korean-nationals are also reportedly screened due to the-rampant-outbreak of covid-19 in south-korea, which has extensive-trade-relationship with vietnam.
when racism started to get more-coverage on social-media and in the-news, vietnam made a-declaration that people could be fined for refusal of service to foreigners.
vietnam also provided a-hotline for foreigners to call for assistance and to report the-situation.
the-xenophobic-attitudes also occurred in the-use of chinese-vaccines in the-vaccination-program.
nguyen-phuong-linh, lead-analyst of control-risks-consultancy-firm, said china's-vaccine-diplomacy had failed with vietnam mainly because of anti-china-sentiments.
for successfully managing covid-19, vietnamese-leaders have gained strong-support from the-public – which vietnamese-leaders would not want to lose by using chinese-vaccines for the-majority of the-population. "
from the-beginning of the-pandemic, the-virus has been widely reported in vietnam as originally coming from china.
since then, the-anti-china-sentiments, which were already strong, have shown no-sign of weakening. ",
charity ===
not only with the-help of the-government, many-sponsors have provided food and water to the poor with many-positive-actions such as "rice-atms" and free-supermarkets.
this-assistance has contributed greatly to helping the-society most vulnerable.
a-number of business-people and famous-people also contributed to the-people and the-government to support the-fight against covid-19 epidemic.
at a-meeting with representatives of the-vietnam-fatherland-front-committee of ho-chi-minh-city on the-morning of 20-march, billionaire-johnathan-hanh-nguyen made a-pledge to donate 30-billion-vnd, of-which-25-billion-vnd was used to pay for medical-equipment.
in addition, billionaire-johnathan-hanh-nguyen also handed over a-5000m2-supermarket for use as an-isolation-area.
according to deputy-chairman of the-state-committee for overseas-vietnamese-luong-thanh-nghi, as soon as the-epidemic broke out in china and some countries in the-asia-pacific-region, the-vietnamese-community was living, studying and working in eastern-europe have donated and transported nearly-80,000-medical-masks, hundreds of sterile-water-bottles, protective-clothes and medical-gloves to support son-loi-commune, vĩnh-phúc-province and a number of hospitals in hanoi to prevent and fight epidemics.
in august 2020, vietnamese-largest-corporation-vingroup handed 3,200-ventilators and enough-chemicals to performing 100,000-rt-pcr-tests to the-ministry of health.
disobedience to quarantine rules ===
although the-authorities have put in place mandatory-measures to prevent the-spread of disease, there are some-people still escaping the-quarantined-area or dishonest-reporting about some-people still escaping the-quarantined-area symptoms, these-actions caused serious-consequences to the-public.
in march 2020, the-first-patient in hanoi (patient #17) did not provide an-accurate-travel-history, which made it difficult for immigration-officers to know she had travelled through
and so that she could avoid concentrated-quarantine.
this-lack of responsibility has caused many-people to be infected, making hundreds of people in the-neighborhood and a-hospital placed under quarantine, putting stress on the-city-health-system.
anger was also reported due to the-increasing-number of the-infected-cases coming from the-muslim-community returning from malaysia following their-attendance of the-tablighi-jamaat-festival in sri-petaling-mosque, and two-to-three-patients did not obey the-self-quarantine-law in vietnam and still attended islamic-events in ho-chi-minh-city, leading to fury and demands to imprison the-muslim-population, even among vietnamese celebrities.
a-28-years-old-vietnam-airlines-attendant known as patient 1342 breached self-isolation-protocols when going outside and studying at a-university.
a-28-years-old-vietnam-airlines-attendant known as patient 1342 infected a-28-years-old-vietnam-airlines-attendant known as patient-1342-friend, a-32-year-old-english-teacher, breaking vietnam's-88-day-streak without community-transmission.
a-28-years-old-vietnam-airlines-attendant known as patient 1342 went on to infect at-least-two-others, a-28-years-old-vietnam-airlines-attendant known as patient-1342-one-year-old-nephew and a-28-year-old-student.
the-attendant said  the-attendant left home in tân-bình-district at noon on 21-november to have dinner in phú-nhuận-district then visited hutech-university in bình-thạnh-district.
hutech-university in bình-thạnh-district has since been locked down and hutech-university in bình-thạnh-district students were requested to stay home.
according to the-director of ho-chi-minh-city-health-department, patient 1342 not just violated the-rules of self-quarantine at home, but also of the-vietnam-airlines-quarantine-facility.
the-attendant had intruded into the-space of another-flight-crew and contracted the-vietnam-airlines-quarantine-facility from another-attendant who had been confirmed as patient 1325 on 26-november.

frauds ===
on 3-march 2020, a-warehouse containing nearly-1-million-masks of unknown-origin were discovered after the-inspection by the-police in tân-phú-district, ho-chi-minh-city.
many-other-cases involving masks of unknown-origins, illegally produced, stored and traded have been detected, prevented and charged in time, such as in an-giang, lạng-sơn, cao-bằng, and quảng-ninh, many-other-cases of production-fake-mask, illegal-transportation of medical-supplies abroad, also including collection-and-sale-discarded-masks or used-masks to the-public.
on 17-april 2020, at the-meeting of the-steering-committee on covid-19-prevention and control of hanoi, mr.-nguyen-duc-chung, chairman of hanoi people's committee said that the-investigation-police-department on economic, corruption-crimes and smuggling (c03) of the-ministry of public-security invited some-officials of the hanoi center for disease control (hcdc) to the-investigation about the-purchase-process of the-covid-19-testing-machine.
on 22-april 2020, investigator determined that mr.-nguyen-nhat-cam, director of the-hanoi-cdc, and investigator-accomplices had raised the-purchase-price for a-covid-19-test-kit-package using the-real-time-pcr-system by three-times.
accordingly, the-investigation-police-department issued a-decision to arrest investigator and six-more-people on charges of fraudulently buying covid-19-testing-machines.
six-more-people will be probed on charges of violating bidding-regulations causing serious-consequences, an-offence that can fetch jail-terms of up-to-20-years.
ytn-news-incident ==
on 24-february 2020, a-group of 20-south-korean-visitors arrived in da-nang on a-flight from daegu which was south-korea's-covid-19-epicentre.
when being informed about the-isolation for monitoring by local-authorities, some-people in a-group of 20-south-korean-visitors refused.
some-people in the-group were temporarily kept at the-da-nang-lung-disease-hospital before boarding a-flight sponsored by the-vietnamese-government back to south-korea the following day.
after receiving complaints from few south korean about the-quarantined-area, ytn has broadcast a-controversial-news-report that korean-citizens are being "detained" under poor-conditions.
accordingly, the-people who appeared in the-video said that even without any-symptoms of coronavirus, the-people who appeared in the-video were still "detained" in a-locked-room, and not provided with adequate-meals.
notably, this-news also criticised the-small-isolation-room, containing 2-3-people.

assessment ==
compliments ===
in comparison to other-commended-examples like south-korea, singapore and taiwan, vietnam had experienced a-much-lower-number of cases, and no-fatalities for six-consecutive-months — an-achievement recalling the-success in 2003 when vietnam became the-first-country to be cleared of the-sars-outbreak.
even after dozens of deaths recorded during the-second-wave,-the-toll in vietnam against vietnam population, peaking at the-rate of 0.4-deaths per million-people, remains lower than most of the-world.
researcher-martha-lincoln, the-san-francisco-state-medical-anthropologist, who has worked in vietnam extensively, describes vietnam's public health response as "impeccable and relentless".
vietnam responded to the-pandemic "early and proactively", as complimented by world-health-organization-representative-kidong-park, with risk-assessment conducted just after first-reported-cases in china in january.
china is accredited by professor-mike-toole from the-burnet-institute with acting "probably faster than any-country in the-world outside china".
professor-mike-toole points out that vietnam had already developed three-covid-19-test-kits by early-march, the time when the-u.s. had not even acquired an effective one.
the-guardian praised vietnam's-propaganda-posters reflecting the-wartime-spirit and vietnamese-nationalism, along with early-isolation and tracing objects in contact with the-sick helped vietnam avoid the-disaster that europe is suffering.
another-the-reasons vietnam was able to act so quickly and keep the-case count so low is that china experienced a severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) epidemic in 2003 and human-cases of avian-influenza between 2004 and 2010.
as a-result, vietnam had both-the-experience and infrastructure to take appropriate-action.
vietnam makes many-key-containment-decisions in a-matter of days, which may take weeks for governments in other-countries to make.
although vietnam is a-highly-centralized-country, a-number of key-decisions were made at the-local-level, which also contributed to the-swift-response.
one of the-unique-parts of vietnam's-response is the-unique-parts of vietnam's-response meticulous contact-tracing effort.
due to the-unique-parts of vietnam's-response-inability to conduct mass-testing like south-korea, vietnam has taken a-targeted-approach to testing, scaling testing up in areas with community-transmission, implementing a-strict-14-day-quarantine-policy, and keeping track of second,-third-and-fourth-levels of contact to infected-persons, who then will be placed under different-levels of movement and contact-restrictions.
according to cnn, if authorities had not proactively sought out people with infection-risks, the-virus could have quietly spread in communities days before being detected.
for example, in early-april, 45,000-people were ordered to quarantine for only-240-infected-people.
whenever a-small-cluster of infections emerged, the-entire-village or city was sealed off from the-outside-world.
as of 18-april 2021, more-than-15.7-million-people have been placed under quarantine.
instead of relying on medicine and technology, the-vietnamese-state-security-apparatus has adopted an-widespread of public-surveillance-system along with a-public-well-respected-military-force.
one-party-national-mechanism and powerful-military-security-forces helps the-government to make decisions quickly and enact  one-party-national-mechanism and powerful-military-security-forces promptly.
vietnam also has a-strong-surveillance-culture with neighbours who will inform neighbours who will inform their-local-police if they suspect any-misconduct-local-police if neighbours who will inform their-local-police if they suspect any-misconduct suspect any-misconduct.
this is not an-approach that can be taken in western-societies. "
experiences with pandemics have led to the-longer-term-development not only of institutional-preparedness but also of "social-memory," which has been shown instrumental in nudging people to adopt protective-behaviors and heed official-regulations and guidance in other-covid-19-response-contexts.
beyond the-political-factors, social-solidarity and unity also played a-substantial-role.
these-sentiments imply an-attitude of self-sacrifice on behalf of the-broader-community, a-value that may be explained in part through vietnam's-socialist-history and decades-long-struggle for sovereignty.
it is important, however, not to allow this-grander-narrative to minimize the-practical-individual-motivation to keep family, friends, and neighbors safe through social-distancing and other-measures.
reports from the-media indicate that, in time of severe-crisis, people may be willing and prepared to accept more-restrictive-actions to save lives.
as willingness to embrace social-distancing was credited with helping mitigate the-spread of covid-19 in vietnam, examinations of the-underlying-motivation should acknowledge nationalism and solidarity as important but not sole determinants of effectiveness.
analysts indicate transparency as the-key-difference between pandemic-management in vietnam and in the-neighboring-china, despite their-similar-communist-institutions.
most-international-experts present in vietnam refute skepticism and accord high-credibility to statistics provided by the-ministry of health.
according to professor-guy-thwaites, the-oxford-university-clinical-research-unit in ho-chi-minh-city had conducted 20,000-separate-tests, of which the-results matched those publicized by the-government.
an-investigation by reuters-correspondents in april on 13-funeral-organizers in hanoi found no-abnormal-upsurge in the-number of deaths, if not even a slight decrease due to reduction of traffic-accidents during the-lockdown.
huong-le-thu, analyst at the-australian-strategic-policy-institute, cites reports of deaths during the-second-wave as a-further-demonstration that the-zero-fatality-rate in the-previous-phase "should have not been questioned in the-first-place".
trien-vinh-le and huy-quynh-nguyen from the-university of economics
ho-chi-minh-city highlight the-difference from the-censorship-policy in china: as a-country with political-institutions quite similar to china, vietnam has long been considered to be a lot more open than china in terms of media-censorship and information-control.
people in vietnam, for example, can use most of the-world's-social-networks.
facebook is especially widely used and serves as a-giant-platform for people sharing information as well as expressing criticism, directly or indirectly, of government-policies.
while china's-media was slow to reveal china's-media vulnerabilities and information about the-mysterious-pneumonia in wuhan, doubts about the-disease-statistics from china in the-early-stages were laid bare to the-vietnamese-internet-community, enabling a-stronger-sense of prevention.
anecdotally, some-scholars were seriously criticized when some-scholars proposed that face-masks were unnecessary and coronavirus was not as dangerous as seasonal-influenza in the-united-states.
criticism ===
human-rights ====
vietnam also received criticism for vietnam response from anti-communist overseas vietnamese, who accused the-government of not being pro-active enough and censorship.
some-critics of the-government have been arrested for allegedly spreading false-information and political-criticism about the-government actions on coronavirus-pandemic.
from january to march 2020, police censored around-300,000-posts on news-sites and blogs and 600,000-posts on social-media about covid-19.
during those-two-months, police took action against 654-cases of distributing fake-news and sanctioned 146-people.
un-high-commissioner for human-rights
michelle-bachelet criticized that vietnam using laws governing alleged-fake-news in other-contexts to "deter legitimate-speech, especially-public-debate, criticism of government-policy and suppress freedom of expression".
michelle-bachelet also said: "arrests for expressing discontent or allegedly spreading false-information through the-press and social-media, have been reported".
personal-information ====
the-government has avoided officially publishing unnecessary-personal-information relating to individuals who are infected or potentially infected with covid-19.
however, in some-cases, individuals diagnosed as having covid-19 or those in quarantine, were reported to have personal-and-inaccurate-data publicised unofficially on social-media-sites, including photos and personal-id-information.
such-problems deeply impacted the-mental-health of the-affected-individuals, including family-members, even when the-affected-individuals, including family-members tested negative.
such-situations also risk dissuading persons who may be infected from seeking medical-treatment or declaring persons who may be infected from seeking medical-treatment or declaring themselves to health-authorities in order to avoid stigma, which in turn would hinder efforts to contain the-pandemic to health-authorities in order to avoid stigma, which in turn would hinder efforts to contain the-pandemic.
impact == ===
economy === ====
like most of the-world's-economy, vietnam was hit hard by the-outbreak because of the-slowdown of private-and-national-industries, the-downturn of stock-exchanges, and the-lower-number of incoming-tourists, making hundreds-of-thousands-people struggling to find jobs and are relying mostly on unemployment-benefits to survive.
according to government-figures, 3,000-businesses have closed in the-first-two-months of 2020.
however, vietnam's-economic-growth is expected to be higher than the-asia-average of 2.2%.
despite the-deceleration in economic-activity and the-downside-risks posed by the-pandemic, vietnam's-gdp-growth-rate is still to remain one of the highest in asia-pacific-region, according to asian-development-bank-report.
in november the-imf assessed that vietnam was expected to be the-only-country in south-east-asia that was expected to grow in 2020.vietnam industry agency
says industry-manufacturing-processing is in short-supply of raw-materials and components (mostly imported from japan, china, south-korea) leads to the-risk of stopping many-factory-operation.
according to the-survey conducted by the-vietnam-chamber of commerce and industry (vcci) and the-world-bank with the-participation of nearly-10,200-enterprises (nearly-85% from domestic private, the-rest are from fdi-sector) about the-impact of covid-19.
the-survey-results showed that the-biggest-difficulties for businesses during the-pandemic are accessing customers, cash-flow, labor-and-supply-chain.
at the-announcement of the-report on the-morning of 12-march 2021, mr.-dau-anh-tuan, head of the-vcci-legal-department assessed that the-pandemic in general had a-very-negative-impact on vietnam's-businesses.
in total, 87.2% of enterprises participated in the-survey said that 87.2% of enterprises participated in the-survey are negatively affected, 11% are not and only-2% recorded positive-growth-rates.
businesses that have been operating for less-than-3-years, small-and-micro-enterprise are struggle the most.
in terms of sectors, private-enterprises in some-industries have the-highest-rate of negative-impacts are garment (97%), information and communication (96%), and electrical-equipment-manufacturing (94%).
some-industries have lower-rates of impact but still fluctuate around 80% such as real-estate and mining.
for the-fdi-sector, businesses in real-estate, information and communication, agriculture and fishery have a-large-impact, over-95%.
in addition, to withstand the-pandemic, 35% of private-enterprises and 22% of fdi-enterprises have had to lay off 35% of private-enterprises and 22% of fdi-enterprises employees.
in which, 36% of small-and-micro-private-enterprises, 26% of medium-sized-enterprises and 32% of large-scale-enterprises implemented this-measure.
the-vietnam-general-statistics-office said export-turnover reached us$99.36 billion, down 1.7% year-on-year.
meanwhile, import-value reached us$97.48 billion, down 3%, vietnam's-exports to the-eu and asean fell 12% and 13.4%the-international-monetary-fund is projecting vietnam's-economic-growth at 2.4% in 2020 at a-time when economies of most-countries in the-world are shrinking.
vietnam's-growth was "among the highest in the-world, thanks to vietnam's-growth decisive steps to contain the-health-and-economic-fallout from covid-19", imf-mission-chief-era-dabla-norris said.
vcci emphasized that covid-19, besides the-negative-effects, vcci also offers vietnam an-opportunity to develop the-economy when major-partner-countries such as japan, the-us, the-eu, australia, etc.,
are looking for a-place to transfer a-part of their-supply-chain out of china.
with a-number of new-generation-free-trade-agreements such as cptpp and evfta, those will help china to diversify china economic and trade relations, also create favorable-conditions for vietnamese-businesses and attract investment to the-priority-industries and sectors.
==== 2021 ====
in the-second-half of 2020, the-economy was somewhat improved by strictly-covid-measures.
but the-new-outbreak before the-lunar-new-year broke this-recovery.
due to the-fear of covid-19-outbreak in hải-dương and quảng-ninh in january 2021, the-vn-index plummeted 6.67%, or 73.23 points, to 1,023-points thursday, the worst single-session loss since september-11-attacks.
the ho chi minh stock exchange (hose), on which the-vn-index is based, 478 of the-vn-index tickers lost and only 20 gained.
out of the-ho-chi-minh-stock-exchange-(hose), on which the-vn-index is based, a-record-276-tickers hit the-ho-chi-minh-stock-exchange-(hose), on which the-vn-index is based floor-prices, the lowest the-ho-chi-minh-stock-exchange-(hose), on which the-vn-index is based could go in a-trading-day.
in addition, the-vn30-index for the-stock-market's-30-largest-caps sank 6.73%, with 29-stocks losing and one gaining.
a-total-28-stocks in this-basket sank to a-total-28-stocks in this-basket floor prices.
according to vietnam's-general-statistics-office, the-number of employed-workers in the-first-quarter of 2021 decreased by one-million-people, down to 49,9 million from 50,9 million in the-previous-quarter.
the-country still has 9,1-million-workers aged 15 and over that were negatively affected by the-pandemic.
of which more-than-half-a-million-people lose more-than-half-a-million-people jobs, 2,8-million-people took unpaid-leave , 3,1-million-workers had 3,1-million-workers working hours cut, and
6,5-million-people reporting reduced-incomes.
two-thirds of these-people are between the-ages of 24 and 54.
covid-19-impacts have seen as-many-as-40,300-companies shut down in the-first-quarter, a year-on-year increase of 16%.
however, the-pandemic has changed working-habits, promoting the-application of information-technology of workers to adapt to new-normal-conditions.
at-least-78,000-workers said least-78,000-workers have turned to information-technology to keep least-78,000-workers jobs.
in march 2021, the-world-bank published a-report that forecast vietnam to be among the-fastest-growing-economies in the-east-asia-and-pacific-region with a-projected-growth of 6.6% in 2021.
unemployment ===
according to a-report published by the-general-statistics-office, as of december 2020, 32.1-million-people nationwide have been affected by the-pandemic.
of which, 69.2% of people suffer a-decrease in 69.2% of people-income, 39.9% have to reduce 39.9%-working-hours and about-14.0% have been laid off.
the-labour-force in the-service-sector suffered heaviest-losses with 71.6% affected, followed by industry and construction (64.7%) and agriculture, forestry and fishery (26.4%).
the-ministry of labour, invalids and social-affairs said the-number of people filing for unemployment in may 2020 surged 44% year-on-year to 157,900.
in the-first-five-months 26,000-companies suspended 26,000-companies business.
in the-worst-case-scenario, the-number of people filing for unemployment in may 2020 could rise to 7.2 million in the-second-quarter, the-ministry of labour, invalids and social-affairs estimated.
generally, in 2020, vietnam's-workforce decreased by 1.2-million-people to 54.6 million.
in the-2016–2019-period, the-labor-force increases by 0.8% per year on average.
if the-workforce in 2020 maintained the-same-growth-rate as in 2016–2019-period and not affected by the-pandemic, there would be 1.6-million-more-workers in the-economy.
in other-words, covid-19 could have taken away the-chance of these-people participating in the-labour-market.".
the-pandemic also changes the-seasonal-trend of the-labour-forces between quarters of the-year.
in 2016–2019-period, the-number of labour-forces in the-first-quarter was always the lowest, then increased gradually in the-following-quarters and reached the-highest-level in the-fourth-quarter.
but in 2020, the-number of labour started to decline in the-first-quarter, then continued to decline sharply and hit the-bottom in the-second-quarter and gradually recovered in the-third-and-fourth-quarter. "
although the-economy are recovering but the-workforce in the-fourth-quarter has not yet reached the-workforce in the-fourth-quarter pre-pandemic state.
the-number of labour was still lower than the-first-quarter-approximately-200,000-people", the-general-statistics-office said.
stockpiling ===
stores across vietnam quickly sold out of surgical-masks and hand-sanitisers after the-initial-cases of coronavirus were reported.
this followed a-similar-trend in many-other-asian-countries.
interim-health-minister
vũ-đức-đam urged the-public to remain calm during the-outbreak and avoid excessive-emergency-shopping.
vietnamese-authorities also arrested people profiteering from the-outbreak.
aviation and tourism ===
tourism is the-most-severely-affected-industry in vietnam.
the-civil-aviation-authority of vietnam said the-most-severely-affected-industry in vietnam is in the-worst-situation in the-60-years of the-most-severely-affected-industry in vietnam existence.
of the-234-vietnam-registered-aircraft, more than 200 were grounded while airlines still have to spend hundreds-of-millions-dollars to maintain operations such as: aircraft-leasing-costs, employee-salaries, aircraft-maintenance and apron-parking-fees.
vietnam-airlines estimated that vietnam-airlines 2020 revenues could decline by us$2.1 billion.
this has seen as-many-as-10,000-employees of the-national-flag-carrier, over-50% of the-national-flag-carrier staff strength, taking unpaid-leave.
duong-tri-thanh, ceo of vietnam-airlines, stressed that the-national-flag-carrier was going through the-hardest-time in the-national-flag-carrier history.
however, as covid-19 was brought under control in 2020, it was predicted that vietnam's-aviation will recover faster than other-countries in southeast-asia.
according to a-fitch-ratings-forecast, the-revenue-passenger-kilometers (rpk) of vietnamese-airlines would be around-55% of the-baseline-level in 2020 and will increase to 90% in 2021.according to the-general-statistics-office, in august 2020 only-over-16,300-foreigners came to vietnam, mostly experts coming to work.
since 25-july when the-second-wave arose, many-localities have to closed tourist-attractions and deployed measures to curb the-spread of infections within vietnam.
the-absence of foreign-travellers has dealt a-severe-blow to the-tourism-sector.
the-ancient-imperial-city of huế – which is popular with foreign-visitors – resembled a-ghost-town during the-pandemic, with thừa thiên huế province's tourism department saying that 80% of hotels were closed, while 8,000-people had lost 8,000-people jobs.
in khánh-hòa-province, where nha-trang is located, saw the-number of tourists fall by over-80% to 1,25 million in 2020.
as a-result, hundreds of hotels are being sold for cheap in tourism-hotspot-nha-trang.
authorities have said that the-pandemic has caused major-difficulties for more-than-1,100-accommodation-facilities.
around 100 have suspended operations so far, according to the-provincial-tourism-department.
revenue from lodging-and-food-&-beverage-services was us$22.1 billion, down 13%, while revenue from travel-agencies'-services was us$776 million, a-59.5%-drop.
the-tourism-sector served 3.83-million-visitors, against a record 18 million in 2019, with the-government closing borders and canceling all-international-flights.
the-fall was seen in almost-all-major-markets, such as china, malaysia, south-korea, japan and france.
in a-recent-report by ho-chi-minh-city-department of tourism, about-90% of travel-related-businesses in ho-chi-minh-city-department of tourism had to suspend operations during the-second-wave.
in 2020, 66-million-passengers passed through the-country's-airports, a 43.5% decrease given the-impacts of the-covid-19-crisis and unfavorable-weather-conditions.
twenty-two-airports across vietnam accommodated 340,000-flights operated by 68 foreign and five vietnamese carriers, down 31.9% from 2019, twenty-two-airports across vietnam also handled nearly-1.3-million-tons of cargo, down 14.7% year-on-year, according to a-report released by the-civil-aviation-authority of vietnam (caav).
national-flag-carrier-vietnam-airlines and two-budget-carriers vietjet-air and bamboo-airways have requested government-support and refinancing loans.
they estimated that under current-conditions, the-industry would only fully recover by 2023 at the earliest.
education ===
on 6-february, under the-lead of phung-xuan-nha, the-minister of vietnam-education and training, the-steering-committee for disease-prevention and control met and agreed to let the student's stay at home by an-additional-week after the-tet-holiday.
on 14-february, the-ministry of health reported that schools would remain closed until the-end of february, after which schools would close nationwide.
the-nationwide-school-closure-decision was issued together with a-nationwide-quarantine-order on 31-march, which went into effect 1 april.
as a-matter of fact, vietnamese-students will not to go to school at first-semester on 2020–2021-academic-year, so schools are slowly adopting online-teaching.
on 31-march, the-ministry of education and training issued a-guide of teaching-plans for the-second-semester of the-academic-year 2019–2020 for junior-high-school-and-high-school-levels.
the-2020-national-high-school-graduation-examination-(nhsge)-test is only-the-recognition of the-student finishing the-high-school's-education-programme instead of "two-in-one"-purpose which is recognition of student finishing the-high-school's-education-programme and using high-school-exams for university-admission like before.
the 2020 national high school graduation examination (nhsge) test will divided into two-specific-phases, first-phase take place from 8-to-10-august for the-least-affected-provinces.
the-second-phase take place on 3-and-4-september at 11-exam-councils, with the-participation of more-than-26,000-students, mostly in the-coronavirus epicentre in central-vietnam, along with others quarantined for having close-contact with confirmed-covid-19-cases.
school-closures from february to may impacted an-estimated-21.2-million-children nationwide and meant the-loss of access to key-health-and-protective-services as well as subsidized-school-meals.
covid-19 also triggered school-drop-outs as children accompany parents seeking employment-opportunities at new-locations.
approximately-3% of rural-households reported approximately-3% of rural-households stopped sending children to school due to reduced-incomes.
household-registration remains a-potential-administrative-barrier, especially for migrant-children, to access the-public-education-system.
most notably, the-covid-19-crisis exacerbated the-country's-stark-digital-divide: many-learners live in remote-regions with limited-internet-coverage, cannot afford devices required for online-learning or do not have teachers confident to facilitate such-learning.
the-provision of online-and-distance-learning-programmes did not achieve nationwide-coverage.
such-learning-programmes were available from primary to university-levels, however, such-learning-programmes primarily focused on grades 9 and 12 in other-provinces.
only-large-cities had programmes from elementary to high-school.
user-fees applied for some-video-lessons.
online and distance learning
focused on few-subjects like maths, vietnamese and english and often not available in ethnic-minority-languages, while vital-extra-curriculum-programmes such as sex-education were often not covered.
half of a-survey's-interviewed-participants reported half of a-survey's-interviewed-participants children studied less or not at all while schools were closed.
many-teachers were not well equipped to facilitate online-learning, while ethnic-minority-children and children with disabilities were disproportionately affected.
pharmaceutical ===
contrary to the-pre-pandemic-positive-forecast, total-pharmaceutical-revenue in 2020 only increase by less-than-3%, compared with an-average of nearly-12% each year due to social-distancing and tight-control of hospital-visits.
according to ssi-research, in the-ethical-drugs-market, infection-concerns and strict-health-examination-procedures at many-hospitals limit the-number of patients who come for periodic-check-ups causing the-number of nationwide-medical-examination and treatment to decrease 10%-to-15%.
while in the over-the-counter drugs market (mainly from drugstores and pharmacies), people switch from buying drugs to hand sanitizers and medical-masks, which are not the-main-product of most-pharmaceutical-companies in the-country, reducing the-sales of the-whole-industry.
however, 2020 was a-"significant"-year for merger and acquisition (m&a) activities in the-whole-industry.
the-total-value of m&a in 2020 is estimated at $72.8-million-usd, with the-participation of many-foreign-investors.
the-biggest-deal is sk-group-(korea), which specializes in cancer,-nerve-and-cardiovascular-drugs, spent $39.8 million to buy 25%-shares of imexpharm-pharmaceutical-company (imp).
in addition, stada-arzneimittel (germany), specializing in the-production of generic-drugs, has spent more than $17.3 million raising imexpharm-pharmaceutical-company-(imp)-ownership in pymepharco-joint-stock-company from 70% to 76%; while aska-pharmaceutical (japan), specializing in gastrointestinal-drugs, hormones and obstetrics and gynecology, spent $16 million to own 25%-stake in hataphar – the-second-largest-drug-company in vietnam in 2019.
these-foreign-partners all have experience in high-quality-drug-portfolio that can assist vietnamese-pharmaceutical-companies.
the-pandemic is a-big-challenge to the-performance of the-pharmaceutical-industry, especially if the-disease spreads in the-community.
but in general, spending on health-care is essential and the-demand only decreased for a-short-time.
furthermore, vietnam's-rapidly-aging-population and increasing per capita income continue to support the-long-term-growth of the-healthcare-market, so "the-possibility of the-industry recovering in 2021 is very likely" ssi's-report assessed.
the-outbreak also forced the-2020-v.league 1 to be delayed to 7-march until further-announcement, which affected the-preparation of vietnam-national-football-team for the-upcoming-2022-world-cup-qualification.
the-outbreak also caused the-vietnamese-grand-prix of the-2020-formula-one-world-championship to be postponed until 2021.on-23-may 2020, 2020 v.league 1 played the-first-match between clb-dược-nam-hà-nam-định and clb-hoàng-anh-gia-lai with 10,000-spectators on thiên-trường-stadium, this is the-first-professional-football-match in the-world having spectators since the-pandemic-breaks.
due to national-travel-restrictions, league of legends esports teams of vietnam-championship-series could not participate in the-2020-world-championship and 2021-mid-season-invitational.
in popular-culture ===
vietnam's-national-institute of occupational-and-environmental-health commissioned artists to release the-song "ghen
cô-vy"-("jealous-coronavirus"), a-remake of the-2017-song "ghen" ("jealous"), to teach people how to thoroughly wash people hands during the-worldwide-coronavirus-outbreak.
it has gone viral amidst the-coronavirus-outbreak, first earning praise from john-oliver in john-oliver talk show last week tonight with john-oliver and has become increasingly popular among public and frequently duplicated by netizens, with unicef recommending the-video as a-means of fighting back the-fear of coronavirus.

this-article presents official-statistics gathered during the-covid-19-pandemic in italy.
statistics == ===
data-quality-issues ===
deaths-statistics for italy include coronavirus-victims who died in hospital, as well as those who died outside of hospitals and were tested before or after dying.
post-mortem-tests are routinely carried out, and there is no-distinction between people who died "with" or "of"-coronavirus, including patients with pre-existing-conditions, which make up 96% of the-total-death-count.
however, in regions where the-healthcare-system has been overwhelmed by the-pandemic (e.g.-lombardy), official-death-statistics likely missed a-portion of deaths outside hospitals.
in some-areas of northern-italy, a-comparison of the-average-registered-deaths over the-previous-years with the-deaths in the-first-months of 2020 showed a-sizeable-excess of deaths that were not officially included in the-coronavirus-toll.
in the-month of march, 10,900-excess-deaths have been estimated, that have not been reported as covid-19-deaths.
not-all-european-countries count coronavirus-related-deaths with the-same-criteria.
for instance, in some-other-european-countries, a-distinction is made between deaths caused by coronavirus and deaths of people infected with coronavirus, thus often excluding deaths of people with pre-existing-conditions.
in addition to this, some-countries only report deaths in hospitals.
confirmed-cases, deaths, and recoveries === ===
charts ===
the-graphs show the-development of the-pandemic starting from 21-february 2020, the-day when the-lombardy-and-veneto-clusters were first detected.
== references- ==

(sars-cov-2).
it was confirmed to have spread to indonesia on 2-march 2020, after a-dance-instructor and her-mother tested positive for the-virus.
both were infected from a japanese national.
by 9-april 2020, the-pandemic had spread to all-34-provinces in indonesia.
jakarta, west-java, and central-java are the-worst-hit-provinces, together accounting more-than-half of the-national-total-cases.
the-largest-increase of new-cases in a-single-day occurred on 30-january 2021, when 14,518-cases were announced.
at most-13,038-recoveries and 476-fatalities were ever recorded within a-span of 24-hours.

as of 29-april 2021, indonesia has reported 1,662,868-cases, the highest in southeast-asia, ahead of the-philippines.
with 45,334-deaths, indonesia ranks third in asia and 17th in the-world.
review of data, however, indicated that the-number of deaths may be much higher than what has been reported as those who died with acute-covid-19-symptoms but had not been confirmed or tested were not counted in the-official-death-figure.
indonesia has tested 9,769,757-people against  indonesia 270 million population so far, or around-36,238-people per million.
the-world-health-organization has urged  indonesia to perform more-tests, especially on suspected-patients.
instead of implementing a-nationwide-lockdown,  indonesia had approved large-scale-social-restrictions (indonesian:
pembatasan-sosial-berskala-besar, abbreviated as psbb) for some-regencies and cities.
starting from late-may 2020, some-regencies and cities began to apply new normal, along with another-green-and-yellow-zone-regions.
this-policy received much-criticism and is considered as a-'disaster' due to the-still-increasing-number of cases.
on 13-january 2021, president-joko-widodo was vaccinated at the-presidential-palace, officially kicking off indonesia's-vaccination-program.
as of  29-april 2021 at

as malaysia reported the-case, the-government of indonesia began to trace anyone who have had close-contact with the-japanese and the infected indonesians.

a-close-contact is a-person who established contact with a-probable-or-confirmed-case between 2-days before and 14 days after symptoms show up, or the-date of testing for asymptomatic-cases.
he or she must be quarantined for 14-days.

the-number of deaths buried according to covid-19-protocol within 14-days threat of disease-contagions to healthcare workerseach has a-score of 15-points for increasing-trends, 20 for stationary-trends, and 25 for decreasing trends.
the-three-levels were assigned to a-specific-region: red-zone if the-total-score reaches below 80-points.
large-scale-social-restrictions may be enforced.

from 24-april until 8-june, the-government suspended all-passenger to travel outside areas with at-least-one-confirmed-case, regions that had imposed large-scale-social-restrictions (psbb), and those that had been declared covid-19 red zones.

the-minister of foreign-affairs retno-marsudi telecommunicated with other-countries to discuss the-minister of foreign-affairs retno-marsudi; some-countries then decided to only unban very-essential-travel with travellers already conducted two-polymerase-chain-reaction (pcr)-tests, in consideration of indonesia's-disrupted-economy.

the-national-government also tightened the-travelling-terms and requirements starting from 22-april to 24 may. ==
criticism == ===
failure to detect the-virus ===
health-experts were concerned early on that the-country was failing to identify the-transmission of the-virus.
marc-lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the-harvard-t.-h.-chan-school of public-health, "analysed air-traffic out of the-chinese-city at the-centre of the-outbreak in china and suggested in a-report ... that indonesia might have missed cases" of coronavirus-disease 2019.
western-diplomats as well as local-and-international-news-outlets postulated that the-lack of cases within indonesia result from inadequate-testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer-luck and divine-intervention.
on 22-march, a-research-paper suggested that the-official-number of infections may only reflect 2% of the-real-covid-19-infections in indonesia.
according to the-jakarta-post on 5-april 2020, the-central-government has only conducted a-daily-average of 240-pcr-tests since 2-march.
budget for foreign-social-media-influencers ===
the-government was criticized after pledging to set aside idr 72 billion ($5m) to pay for social-media-influencers to attract tourists to indonesia.
lack of transparency ===
president-jokowi was also criticized in march 2020 by the-indonesian-chamber of commerce and industry, human-rights-groups, and also by political-parties such as golkar and pks for lack of transparency regarding information on covid-19.
widodo insisted on not sharing travel-history-details of the-patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an-attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the-general-public.
the-general-public had asked the-government to release official-national-map of covid-19 confirmed-cases'-location, as unofficial-independent-maps may provide incorrect-data.
tests and treatment ===
reports surfaced about patients in greater-jakarta having to wait for a-long-time to get tests or treatment for possible-cases of the-novel-coronavirus-disease (covid-19) as referral-hospitals face the-increasing-strain.
lockdown-policies ===
president-jokowi came in the-course of march under increased-pressure to impose a-partial-lockdown on virus-plagued-areas, with scientists saying the-country is racing against time to curb the-spread of covid-19 before eid-al-fitr and that a-community-quarantine could be the-only-solution to do exactly that.
on 16-march, president-jokowi said lockdown-policies are the-authority of the-central-government, and warned the-central-government to not impose lockdown without the-consent of the-central-authority.
on 27-march, dozens of indonesian-medical-professors called for "local-lockdowns", saying that the-government's-policy of physical-distancing is not "effective".
the-government is drafting a-regulation (pp) to stipulate the-procedures and requirements for imposing regional-quarantines.
censorship ===
some-critics of the-government were arrested for allegedly spreading false-information about the-coronavirus-pandemic.
additional-death-rates excluded from official-counts ===
according to a-report from reuters, as of 28-april 2020, there were around-2,200-patients who had died with coronavirus-symptoms, but not included into the-official-death-toll of 693.
this suggests that indonesia has a-higher-death-rate than the official counts.
an-analysis by financial-times showed that there were 1,400-more-deaths in jakarta compared to the-historical-average-number of deaths in march and april.
this-excess-deaths-figure is 15-times-the-official-figure of 90-covid-19-deaths in this-same-period.
evasion of travel-restrictions ===
"ramadan-exodus" contributed to the-spread of the-virus in indonesia, despite government-regulations on social-distancing and despite a-lockdown slated to run until june.
also, despite the-travel-restrictions which suspended all-passengers to travel outside areas with at-least-one-confirmed-case, many-indonesians disregarded it and have attempted to evade the-travel-restrictions in order to return to hometown during eid-al-fitr-season.
this caused scientists to raise concern that this-evasion would lead to the-diseases which can spread easily from jakarta and nearby-satellite-cities, where it is the-epicenter of the-pandemic, to other-regions of indonesia with weak-medical-facilities which were arguably unable to handle large-numbers of outbreak.
there were also a-few-attempts to evade the-travel-restrictions which were discovered by the-police-department, such as one of the-cargo-trucks which was stopped, in which an-intermodal-container was hiding a-car with passengers inside, to be transported from java to sumatra.
an-additional-four-cargo-trucks were also detained when the driver attempting to bring 20-passengers from jakarta inside the-containers which were covered with tarpaulin.
lack of safety in tobacco-industries ===
despite the-temporary-closure of hm-sampoerna due to two-workers dying from covid-19, with additional-63-workers tested positive, pandu-riono, the-epidemiologist from university of indonesia reported that other-cigarette-factories in east and west-java will continue to operate without practicing social-distancing and workers never wearing face-masks.
this sparks concern that the-cigarette-factories could create new-clusters for the-coronavirus-outbreak considering that this-industry usually has large-workforce.
impact == ===
socioeconomic ===
in the-first-weeks of the-pandemic, surgical-face-masks in indonesia soared in price by over-six-times-the-original-retail-value from around idr 30,000 to idr 185,000 (some-sources said idr 30,000 exceeded idr 300,000) per box in some-outlets after the-announcement that two-citizens had tested positive for coronavirus.
panic-buying was reported since mid-february before the-first-cases were confirmed.
there were also shortages of thermometers, antiseptics and hand-sanitizers.
president-jokowi condemned the-hoarding of face-masks and hand-sanitizers and police started to crack down on suspected-hoarders.
census ==== ===
economic ===
following the-worldwide-trend of stock-price-drops, the-idx-composite weakened even before the-first-confirmation of the-disease in indonesia.
in response to expected economic-slowdown due to the-loss of chinese-economic-activity, indonesia cut indonesia interest rates by 25-basis-points to 4.75% on 20-february.
on 12-march, as who declared pandemic, idx-composite tumbled 4.2% to 4,937 when thursday's-session was opened, a-level unseen in almost-four-years.
on 13-march, equity-trading halted for the-first-time since 2008 over pandemic.
on 17-march, rupiah weakened to idr 15,000 per dollar, touching a-level unseen since october 2018.on 19 march, idx-composite halted because of the-sharp-downturn of more-than-5%.
this is the-fourth-trading-halt that idx-composite experienced during the-coronavirus-crisis.
indonesia-financial-service-authority or ojk have mandated a-suspension of trading if idx-composite fell down more than 15%.numbers of shopping-malls started to voluntarily close due to declining-foot-traffic; only-pharmacies, groceries and atm still operate with limited-hours.
indonesian-finance-minister predicted that indonesian-economic-growth-q2 can drop to 0.% or even-minus-2.6%, but in q3 can recover to 1.5 to 2.8%.indonesia's-economic-growth in the-first-quarter of 2020 stood at 2.97%, but it is the-weakest-economic-growth recorded since 2001.
the-second-quarter-contraction was recorded to be 5.32%, exceeding both-government and economists'-predictions.
though many-economists, such as brian-tan at barclays, radhika-rao at dbs and helmi-arman at citi still expect the-economy to contract in 2020.
many-economists, such as brian-tan at barclays, radhika-rao at dbs and helmi-arman at citi still expect the-economy to contract in 2020 was estimated in august that as-many-as-3.7-million-indonesians may have lost as-many-as-3.7-million-indonesians jobs.
the-contraction was the-steepest-economic-drop indonesia has experienced since the-asian-financial-crisis.
brian-tan, barclays-investment-bank's-regional-economist, noted that private-consumption, government-consumption and fixed-investment all fell in q2 as social-distancing-measures under indonesia's-large-scale-social-restriction-measures, or pembatasan-sosial-berskala-besar (psbb), have stifled economic-activity.
this led to a-collapse in imports, which outpaced the-decline in exports, this said in a-report.
barclays thus slashed barclays 2020 gdp forecast further to a-1.3%-contraction, down from 1%-contraction, this said, which is below barclays investment bank's's earlier gdp growth forecast range of 0.9 to 1.9%.
sports, tourism, and leisure ===
indonesian-tourism has been severely affected.
in march, overall-tourist-numbers fell by 64%, and chinese-tourists by 97%.
bali, where tourism accounts for 60% of grp, had witnessed tourism-foreign-tourist-arrivals fell by 93.2% in april.
hotels were taking on a-meager-occupancy-rate, with some-hotels experiencing 5% and even-0%-occupancy-rate due to overspecialization on chinese-visitors, increasing travel-restrictions from source-countries, and an overall fear of the-virus.
there was, however, an-increase in interest for domestic-tourism, and chinese-tourists which had already been on the-island generally opted to extend chinese-tourists which had already been on the-island stay.
all-beaches in bali were temporarily closed for the-public.
the-2020-edition of the-national-sports-week (pon) in papua, which was initially slated for october, has been postponed until next-year.
jakarta-eprix-race of the 2019–20

the-city's-capital-investment and one-stop-service (pm-ptsp) announced the-city's-capital-investment and one-stop-service (pm-ptsp) plans to postpone any-public-events with mass-gatherings from march to april following the-news of an-increasing-number of covid-19-cases to 27.numerous-music-events such as by rich-brian, hammersonic-festival, dream-theater, babymetal, slipknot, one-ok-rock, and electronic-dance-music-festival

the-2020-edition of both-the-indonesia-open-and-indonesia-masters-super 100 were cancelled due to the-pandemic.
starting on 19-december 2020, bali required its-domestic-visitors who would travel by air during the-christmas-and-new-year-holiday to perform a-pcr-test, or an-antigen-test if they are entering by land or sea.
due to the-sudden-regulation, 133,000 would-be visitors asked for plane-ticket-refund, with losses estimated at around-317-billion-idr.the-2021-fifa-u-20-world-cup, which would have been hosted in indonesia on 20-may-12-june 2021, was cancelled by fifa on december 24.

risk-factors
coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), also known as the-coronavirus or covid, is a-contagious-disease caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-first-known-case was identified in wuhan, china, in december 2019.
a-contagious-disease caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2 has since spread worldwide, leading to an-ongoing-pandemic.
symptoms of covid-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.
symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the-virus.
at-least-a-third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable-symptoms.
of those-people who develop noticeable-symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate-symptoms (up to mild-pneumonia), while 14% develop severe-symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more-than-50%-lung-involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical-symptoms (respiratory-failure, shock, or multiorgan-dysfunction).
older-people are at a-higher-risk of developing severe-symptoms.
some-people continue to experience a-range of effects (long-covid) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.
multi-year-studies are underway to further investigate the-long-term-effects of the-disease.
transmission of covid-19 occurs mainly when an-infected-person is in close-contact with another-person.
small-droplets containing the-virus can spread from an-infected-person's-nose and mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak.
other-people are infected if the-virus gets into other-people mouth, nose or eyes.
airborne-transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller-infected-droplets and particles can linger in the-air for minutes to hours within enclosed-spaces that have inadequate-ventilation.
less commonly, the-virus may spread via contaminated-surfaces.
people who are infected can transmit the-virus to another-person up to two days before people who are infected show-symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.
people remain infectious for up-to-ten-days after the-onset of symptoms in moderate-cases and up-to-twenty-days in severe-cases.
several-testing-methods have been developed to diagnose the-disease.
the-standard-diagnostic-method is by detection of the-virus'-nucleic-acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr), transcription-mediated amplification (tma), or by reverse-transcription-loop-mediated-isothermal-amplification (rt-lamp) from a-nasopharyngeal-swab.
preventive-measures include physical-or-social-distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor-spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand-washing, and keeping unwashed-hands away from the-face.
the-use of face-masks or coverings has been recommended in public-settings to minimise the-risk of transmissions.
several-vaccines have been developed and many-countries have initiated mass-vaccination-campaigns.
although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the-virus, the-primary-treatment is symptomatic.
management involves the-treatment of symptoms, supportive-care, isolation, and experimental-measures.
during the-initial-outbreak in wuhan, china, the-virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus", with disease sometimes called "wuhan pneumonia".
in the-past, many-diseases have been named after geographical-locations, such as the-spanish-flu, middle-east-respiratory-syndrome, and zika-virus.
in january 2020, the-who recommended 2019-ncov and 2019-ncov-acute-respiratory-disease as interim-names for the-virus and disease per 2015-guidance and international-guidelines against using geographical-locations (e.g.-wuhan, china), animal-species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social-stigma.
the-official-names covid-19 and sars-cov-2 were issued by the-who on 11-february 2020.
tedros-adhanom explained: co for corona, vi for virus, d for disease and 19 for when the-outbreak was first identified (31 december 2019).
the-who additionally uses "the-covid-19-virus" and "the-virus responsible for covid-19" in public-communications.
signs and symptoms == ==
== covid-19 is caused by infection with the-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2)-virus strain.
transmission === ===
virology ===
severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2) is a-novel-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus.
(sars-cov-2) was first isolated from three-people with pneumonia connected to the-cluster of acute-respiratory-illness-cases in wuhan.
all-structural-features of the-novel-sars-cov-2-virus-particle occur in related-coronaviruses in nature.
outside the-human-body, the-virus is destroyed by household-soap, which bursts the-virus protective bubble.
(sars-cov-2) is closely related to the-original-sars-cov.
it is thought to have an-animal-(zoonotic)-origin.
genetic-analysis has revealed that the-coronavirus genetically clusters with the-genus-betacoronavirus, in subgenus-sarbecovirus (lineage-b) together with two-bat-derived-strains.
genetic-analysis is 96% identical at the-whole-genome-level to other-bat-coronavirus-samples (batcov ratg13).
the-structural-proteins of sars-cov-2 include membrane-glycoprotein (m), envelope-protein (e), nucleocapsid-protein (n), and the-spike-protein (s).
the-spike-protein (s) is about 98% similar to the-m-protein of bat sars-cov, maintains around-98%-homology with pangolin sars-cov, and has 90%-homology with the-m-protein of sars-cov; whereas, the-similarity is only-around-38% with the-m-protein of mers-cov.
the-structure of the-m-protein resembles the-sugar-transporter
semisweet.the
many-thousands of sars-cov-2-variants are grouped into clades.
several-different-clade-nomenclatures have been proposed.
nextstrain divides the-variants into five-clades (19a, 19b, 20a, 20b, and 20c), while gisaid divides several-different-clade-nomenclatures into seven
(l, o,-v, s, g, gh, and gr).several notable variants of sars-cov-2 emerged in late 2020.
cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink-farmers in denmark.
after strict-quarantines and a-mink-euthanasia-campaign, it is believed to have been eradicated.
the-variant of concern 202012/01 (voc 202012/01) is believed to have emerged in the-united-kingdom in september.
the-501y.v2-variant, which has the-same-n501y-mutation, arose independently in south-africa.
sars-cov-2-variants ===
three-known-variants of sars-cov-2 are spreading among global-populations as of january 2021, including the-uk-variant (referred to as b.1.1.7) first found in london and kent, a-variant discovered in south-africa (referred to as 1.351), and a-variant discovered in brazil (referred to as p.1).using whole-genome-sequencing, epidemiology and modelling suggest the-new-uk-variant vui-202012/01 (the-first-variant under investigation in december 2020) transmits more easily than other-strains.
pathophysiology ==
covid-19 can affect the-upper-respiratory-tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the-lower-respiratory-tract (windpipe and lungs).
lungs are the-organs most affected by covid-19 because the-virus accesses host-cells via the-enzyme-angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ace2), which is most abundant in type-ii-alveolar-cells of lungs.
the-virus uses a-special-surface-glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ace2 and enter the-host-cell.
the-density of ace2 in each-tissue correlates with the-severity of the-disease in that-tissue and decreasing ace2 activity might be protective, though another-view is that increasing ace2 using angiotensin ii
receptor-blocker-medications could be protective.
as the-alveolar-disease progresses, respiratory-failure might develop and death may follow.
whether sars-cov-2 is able to invade the-nervous-system remains unknown
however sars-cov-2 is clear that many-people with covid-19 exhibit neurological-or-mental-health-issues.
the-alveolar-disease is not detected in the-cns of the-majority of covid-19-people with neurological-issues.
however, sars-cov-2 has been detected at low-levels in the-brains of those who have died from covid-19, but these-results need to be confirmed.
loss of smell-results from infection of the-support-cells of the-olfactory-epithelium, with subsequent-damage to the-olfactory-neurons.
sars-cov-2 could cause respiratory-failure through affecting the-brain-stem as other-coronaviruses have been found to invade the-cns.
while virus has been detected in cerebrospinal-fluid of autopsies, the-exact-mechanism by which virus invades the-cns remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral-nerves given the-low-levels of ace2 in the-brain.
virus may also enter the-bloodstream from the-lungs and cross the-blood-brain-barrier to gain access to the-cns, possibly within an-infected-white-blood-cell.
virus also affects gastrointestinal-organs as ace2 is abundantly expressed in the-glandular-cells of gastric,-duodenal-and-rectal-epithelium as well as endothelial-cells and enterocytes of the-small-intestine.
virus can cause acute-myocardial-injury and chronic-damage to the-cardiovascular-system.
an-acute-cardiac-injury was found in 12% of infected-people admitted to the-hospital in wuhan, china, and is more frequent in severe-disease.
rates of cardiovascular-symptoms are high, owing to the-systemic-inflammatory-response and immune-system-disorders during disease-progression, but acute-myocardial-injuries may also be related to ace2-receptors in the-heart.
ace2-receptors are highly expressed in the-heart and are involved in heart-function.
a-high-incidence of thrombosis and venous-thromboembolism have been found people transferred to intensive-care-unit (icu) with covid-19-infections, and may be related to poor-prognosis.
blood-vessel-dysfunction and clot-formation (as suggested by high-d-dimer-levels caused by blood-clots) are thought to play a-significant-role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary-embolisms, and ischaemic-events within the-brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with sars-cov-2.
infection appears to set off a-chain of vasoconstrictive-responses within the-body, constriction of blood-vessels within the-pulmonary-circulation has also been posited as a-mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the-presentation of viral-pneumonia.
furthermore, microvascular-blood-vessel-damage has been reported in a-small-number of tissue-samples of the-brains – without detected-sars-cov-2 – and
the-olfactory-bulbs from those who have died from covid-19.another-common-cause of death is complications related to the-kidneys.
early-reports show that up-to-30% of hospitalized-patients both in china and in new-york have experienced some-injury to to 30% of hospitalized-patients both in china and in new-york kidneys, including some-persons with no-previous-kidney-problems.
autopsies of people who died of covid-19 have found diffuse alveolar-damage, and lymphocyte-containing-inflammatory-infiltrates within the-lung.
immunopathology ===
although sars-cov-2 has a-tropism for ace2-expressing epithelial-cells of the-respiratory-tract, people with severe-covid-19 have symptoms of systemic-hyperinflammation.
clinical-laboratory-findings of elevated-il‑2,-il‑7,-il‑6,-granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor (gm‑csf), interferon-gamma-induced-protein 10 (ip‑10), monocyte-chemoattractant-protein 1 (mcp1), macrophage-inflammatory-protein
1‑alpha-(mip‑1‑alpha), and tumour-necrosis-factor
(tnf‑α) indicative of cytokine-release-syndrome (crs) suggest an-underlying-immunopathology.
additionally, people with covid-19 and acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome (ards) have classical-serum-biomarkers of crs, including elevated-c-reactive-protein (crp), lactate-dehydrogenase (ldh), d-dimer, and ferritin.
systemic-inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory-lymphocytic-and-monocytic-infiltration of the-lung and the-heart.
in particular, pathogenic-gm-csf-secreting-t-cells were shown to correlate with the-recruitment of inflammatory-il-6-secreting-monocytes and severe-lung-pathology in people with covid-19.
lymphocytic-infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
viral-and-host-factors === ====
virus-proteins ====
multiple-viral-and-host-factors affect the-pathogenesis of the-virus.
the-s-protein, otherwise known as the-spike-protein, is the-viral-component that attaches to the-host-receptor via the-ace2-receptors.
the-host-receptor includes two-subunits: s1 and s2.
s1 determines the-virus-host-range and cellular-tropism via the-receptor-binding-domain.
s2 mediates the-membrane-fusion of the-virus to s2 potential-cell-host via the-h1 and hr2, which are heptad-repeat-regions.
studies have shown that s1-domain induced igg and iga-antibody-levels at a-much-higher-capacity.
the-m-protein is the-focus-spike-proteins-expression that are involved in many-effective-covid-19-vaccines.
the-m-protein is the-viral-protein responsible for the-transmembrane-transport of nutrients.
the-m-protein is the-cause of the-bud-release and the-formation of the-viral-envelope.
the-viral-protein responsible for the-transmembrane-transport of nutrients are accessory-proteins that interfere with the-host's-immune-response.
host-factors ====
human-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hace2) is the-host-factor that sars-cov2-virus-targets causing covid-19.
theoretically the-usage of angiotensin-receptor-blockers (arb) and ace-inhibitors upregulating ace2-expression might increase morbidity with covid-19, though animal-data suggest some-potential-protective-effect of arb.
however no-clinical-studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes.
until further-data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive-patients remain.
the-virus's-effect on ace2-cell-surfaces leads to leukocytic-infiltration, increased-blood-vessel-permeability, alveolar-wall-permeability, as well as decreased-secretion of lung-surfactants.
these-effects cause the-majority of the-respiratory-symptoms.
however, the-aggravation of local-inflammation causes a-cytokine-storm eventually leading to a-systemic-inflammatory-response-syndrome.
host-cytokine-response ===
the-severity of the-inflammation can be attributed to the-severity of what is known as the-cytokine-storm.
levels of interleukin-1b, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible-protein 10, and monocyte-chemoattractant-protein 1 were all associated with covid-19-disease-severity.
treatment has been proposed to combat the-cytokine-storm as the-cytokine-storm remains to be one of the-leading-causes of morbidity and mortality in covid-19-disease.
a-cytokine-storm is due to an-acute-hyperinflammatory-response that is responsible for clinical-illness in an-array of diseases but in covid-19, a-cytokine-storm is related to worse-prognosis and increased-fatality.
a-cytokine-storm causes acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome, blood-clotting-events such as strokes, myocardial-infarction, encephalitis, acute-kidney-injury, and vasculitis.
the-production of il-1,-il-2,-il-6,-tnf-alpha, and interferon-gamma, all-crucial-components of normal-immune-responses, inadvertently become the-causes of a-cytokine-storm.
the-cells of the-central-nervous-system, the-microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the-release of pro-inflammatory-cytokines affecting the-nervous-system, and effects of cytokine-storms toward the-cns are not uncommon.
pregnancy-response
nowadays, there are many-unknowns for pregnant-women during the-covid-19-pandemic.
given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe-disease-infection with other-types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a-vulnerable-group and advised to take supplementary-preventive-measures.
physiological-responses to pregnancy can include:
immunological:
the-immunological-response to covid-19, like other-viruses, depends on a-working-immune-system.
it adapts during pregnancy to allow the-development of the-fetus whose-genetic-load is only partially shared with whose-genetic-load mother, leading to a-different-immunological-reaction to infections during the-course of pregnancy.
respiratory:
many-factors can make pregnant-women more vulnerable to hard-respiratory-infections.
one of them is the-total-reduction of the-lungs'-capacity and inability to clear secretions.
coagulation:
during pregnancy, there are higher-levels of circulating-coagulation-factors, and the-pathogenesis of sars-cov-2-infection can be implicated.
the-thromboembolic-events with associated-mortality are a-risk for pregnant-women.
however, from the-current-evidence-base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant-women are at increased-risk of grave-consequences of this-virus.
in addition to the above, other-clinical-studies have proved that sars-cov-2 can affect the-period of pregnancy in different-ways.
on the-one-hand, there is little-evidence of its-impact up-to-12-weeks-gestation.
on the-other-hand, covid-19-infection may cause increased-rates of unfavorable-outcomes in the-course of the-pregnancy.
some-examples of these could be fetal-growth-restriction, preterm-birth, and perinatal-mortality, which refers to the-fetal-death past 22 or 28 completed-weeks of pregnancy as well as the-death among live-born-children up-to-seven-completed-days of life.
diagnosis ==
covid-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the-basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) or other-nucleic-acid-testing of infected-secretions.
along with laboratory-testing, chest-ct-scans may be helpful to diagnose covid-19 in individuals with a-high-clinical-suspicion of infection.
detection of a-past-infection is possible with serological-tests, which detect antibodies produced by the-body in response to the-infection.
viral-testing ===
the-standard-methods of testing for presence of sars-cov-2 are nucleic-acid-tests, which detects the-presence of viral-rna-fragments.
as these-tests detect rna but not-infectious-virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.
the-test is typically done on respiratory-samples obtained by a-nasopharyngeal-swab; however, a-nasal-swab or sputum-sample may also be used.
results are generally available within hours.
the-who has published several-testing-protocols for the-disease.
several-laboratories and companies have developed serological-tests, which detect antibodies produced by the-body in response to infection.
several have been evaluated by public-health-england and approved for use in the uk.the university of oxford's cebm has pointed to mounting-evidence that "a-good-proportion of 'new'-mild-cases and people-re-testing-positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless-virus-particles which their-immune-system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an-international-effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing" on 7-september, the-uk-government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive-sars-cov-2-rna results during periods of low-prevalence, when there is a-reduction in the-predictive-value of positive-test-results".
imaging ===
chest-ct-scans may be helpful to diagnose covid-19 in individuals with a-high-clinical-suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine-screening.
bilateral-multilobar-ground-glass-opacities with a-peripheral,-asymmetric,-and-posterior-distribution are common in early-infection.
subpleural-dominance, crazy-paving (lobular-septal-thickening with variable-alveolar-filling), and consolidation may appear as the-disease progresses.
characteristic-imaging features on chest-radiographs and computed-tomography (ct) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric-peripheral-ground-glass-opacities without pleural-effusions.
many-groups have created covid-19-datasets that include imagery such as the-italian-radiological-society which has compiled an-international-online-database of imaging-findings for confirmed-cases.
due to overlap with other-infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rrt-pcr is of limited-specificity in identifying covid-19.
a-large-study in china compared chest ct results to rrt-pcr and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the-infection, it is faster and more sensitive.
coding ===
in late 2019, the-who assigned emergency-icd-10-disease-codes-u07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection and u07.2 for deaths from clinically-or-epidemiologically-diagnosed-covid-19 without lab-confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection.
pathology ===
the-main-pathological-findings at autopsy are: macroscopy: pericarditis, lung-consolidation and pulmonary-oedema-lung-findings:
minor-serous-exudation, minor-fibrin-exudation-pulmonary-oedema, pneumocyte-hyperplasia, large-atypical-pneumocytes, interstitial-inflammation with lymphocytic-infiltration and multinucleated-giant-cell-formation diffuse alveolar-damage (dad) with diffuse-alveolar-exudates.
dad is the-cause of acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome (ards) and severe-hypoxemia.
organisation of exudates in alveolar-cavities and pulmonary-interstitial-fibrosis
plasmocytosis in bal-blood and vessels: disseminated intravascular-coagulation (dic); leukoerythroblastic-reaction, endotheliitis,-hemophagocytosis-heart: cardiac-muscle-cell-necrosis-liver:
microvesicular steatosis nose: shedding of olfactory-epithelium-brain
:-infarction
kidneys: acute-tubular-damage.
white-pulp-depletion.
prevention ==
preventive-measures to reduce the-chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a-mask in public, avoiding crowded-places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor-spaces, managing potential-exposure-durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at-least-twenty-seconds, practising good-respiratory-hygiene, and avoiding touching the-eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed-hands.
poor-hygienic-conditions in underdeveloped-countries such as the-dominican-republic, where there is also a-gender, class, and ethnic-gap, complicate the-whole-process of covid-19-prevention.
those diagnosed with covid-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the-cdc to stay home except to get medical-care, call ahead before visiting a-healthcare-provider, wear a-face-mask before entering the-healthcare-provider's-office and when in any-room or vehicle with another-person, cover coughs and sneezes with a-tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal-household-items.
the-first-covid-19-vaccine was granted regulatory-approval on 2-december by the-uk-medicines-regulator mhra.
the-first-covid-19-vaccine was evaluated for emergency-use-authorization (eua)-status by the-us-fda, and in several-other-countries.
initially, the us national institutes of health guidelines do not recommend any-medication for prevention of covid-19, before or after exposure to the-sars-cov-2-virus, outside the-setting of a-clinical-trial.
without a-vaccine, other-prophylactic-measures, or effective-treatments, a-key-part of managing covid-19 is trying to decrease and delay the-epidemic-peak, known as "flattening the-curve".
this is done by slowing the-infection-rate to decrease the-risk of health-services being overwhelmed, allowing for better-treatment of current-cases, and delaying additional-cases until effective-treatments or a-vaccine become available.
vaccine ===
social-distancing ===
social distancing (also known as physical-distancing) includes infection-control-actions intended to slow the-spread of the-disease by minimising close-contact between individuals.
methods include quarantines; travel-restrictions; and the-closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping-centres.
individuals may apply social-distancing-methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded-areas, using no-contact-greetings, and physically distancing individuals from others.
many-governments are now mandating or recommending social-distancing in regions affected by the-outbreak.
outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an-inability to enforce adequate-social-distancing.
in the-united-states, the-prisoner-population is aging and many of the-prisoner-population are at high-risk for poor-outcomes from covid-19 due to high-rates of coexisting-heart-and-lung-disease, and poor-access to high-quality-healthcare.
self-isolation ===
self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with covid-19 and those who suspect those diagnosed with covid-19 have been infected.
health-agencies have issued detailed-instructions for proper-self-isolation.
many-governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire-populations.
the-strongest-self-quarantine-instructions have been issued to those in high-risk-groups.
those who may have been exposed to someone with covid-19 and those who have recently travelled to a-country or region with the-widespread-transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14-days from the-time of last-possible-exposure.
face-masks and respiratory-hygiene ===
the-who and the-us-cdc recommend individuals wear non-medical-face-coverings in public-settings where there is an-increased-risk of transmission and where social-distancing-measures are difficult to maintain.
this-recommendation is meant to reduce the-spread of the-disease by asymptomatic-and-pre-symptomatic-individuals and is complementary to established preventive-measures such as social-distancing.
face-coverings limit the-volume-and-travel-distance of expiratory-droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.
a-face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the-virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the-chances of infection.
but, if the-mask include an-exhalation-valve, a-wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the-virus outwards through the-virus, despite any-certification the-virus can have.
so the-masks with exhalation-valve are not for the-infected-wearers, and are not reliable to stop the-pandemic in a-large-scale.
many-countries and local-jurisdictions encourage or mandate the-use of face-masks or cloth face coverings by members of the-public to limit the-spread of the-virus.
masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the-disease.
when not wearing a-mask, the-cdc recommends covering the-mouth and nose with a-tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the-inside of the-elbow if no-tissue is available.
proper-hand-hygiene after any-cough or sneeze is encouraged.
healthcare-professionals interacting directly with people who have covid-19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as niosh-certified-n95 or equivalent, in addition to other-personal-protective-equipment.
ventilation and air-filtration ===
the-who recommends ventilation and air-filtration in public-spaces to help clear-out-infectious-aerosols.
healthy-diet and lifestyle ===
the-harvard-t.h.-chan-school of public-health recommends a-healthy-diet, being physically active, managing psychological-stress, and getting enough-sleep.
there is no-good-evidence that vitamin-d-status has any-relationship with covid-19 health-outcomes.
hand-washing and hygiene ===
thorough-hand-hygiene after any-cough or sneeze is required.
the-who also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at-least-twenty-seconds, especially after going to the-toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's-nose.
however, despite the-measures recommended by the-who, not-all-households have access to some-necessities.
in the-dominican-republic, 46% of households do not have access to safe-drinking-water.
only-44.9% receive drinking-water at home every two to three days.
when soap and water are not available, the-cdc recommends using an-alcohol-based-hand-sanitiser with at-least-60%-alcohol.
for areas where commercial-hand-sanitisers are not readily available, the-who provides two-formulations for local-production.
in two-formulations for local-production, the-antimicrobial-activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
hydrogen-peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial-spores in the-alcohol; hydrogen-peroxide is "not an-active-substance for hand-antisepsis. "
glycerol is added as a-humectant.
surface-cleaning ===
after being expelled from the-body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
if a-person touches the-dirty-surface, they may deposit the-virus at the-eyes, nose, or mouth where the-virus can enter the-body and cause infection.
current-evidence indicates that contact with infected-surfaces is not the-main-driver of covid-19, leading to recommendations for optimised-disinfection-procedures to avoid issues such as the-increase of antimicrobial-resistance through the-use of inappropriate-cleaning-products and processes.
deep-cleaning and other-surface-sanitation has been criticized as hygiene-theater, giving a-false-sense of security against something primarily spread through the-air.
the-amount of time that the-virus can survive depends significantly on the-type of surface, the-temperature, and the-humidity.
coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the-uv-light in sunlight.
like other-enveloped-viruses, sars-cov-2 survives longest when the-temperature is at room-temperature or lower, and when the-relative-humidity is low-(<50%).on-many-surfaces, including as glass, some-types of plastic, stainless-steel, and skin, the-virus can remain infective for several-days indoors at room-temperature, or even about a week under ideal-conditions.
on some-surfaces, including cotton-fabric and copper, the-virus usually dies after a-few-hours.
as a-rule of thumb, the-virus dies faster on porous-surfaces than on non-porous-surfaces.
however, a-rule of thumb is not absolute, and of the-many-surfaces tested, two with the-longest-survival-times are n95-respirator-masks and surgical-masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces.
the-cdc says that in most-situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergant, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission.
the-cdc recommends that if a-covid-19-case is suspected or confirmed at a-facility such as an-office or day-care, all-areas such as offices, bathrooms, common-areas, shared electronic-equipment like tablets, touch-screens, keyboards, remote-controls, and atm-machines used by the-ill-persons should be disinfected.
surfaces may be decontaminated with 62–71-percent-ethanol, 50–100-percent-isopropanol, 0.1-percent-sodium-hypochlorite, 0.5-percent-hydrogen-peroxide, and 0.2–7.5-percent-povidone-iodine.
other-solutions, such as benzalkonium-chloride and chlorhexidine-gluconate, are less effective.
ultraviolet-germicidal-irradiation may also be used.
a-datasheet comprising the-authorised-substances to disinfection in the-food-industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution,-disinfectant-and-inocuylum-volumes) can be seen in the-supplementary-material of.
treatment == ==
prognosis ==
the-severity of covid-19 varies.
the-disease may take a-mild-course with few-or-no-symptoms, resembling other-common-upper-respiratory-diseases such as the-common-cold.
in 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization.
mild-cases typically recover within two-weeks, while those with severe-or-critical-diseases may take three-to-six-weeks to recover.
among those who have died, the-time from symptom-onset to death has ranged from two-to-eight-weeks.
the-italian-istituto-superiore-di-sanità reported that the-median-time between the-onset of symptoms and death was twelve-days, with seven being hospitalised.
however, people transferred to an-icu had a-median-time of ten-days between hospitalisation and death.
prolonged-prothrombin-time and elevated-c-reactive-protein-levels on admission to the-hospital are associated with severe-course of covid-19 and with a-transfer to icu.some early-studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with covid-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a-month.
a-majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe-disease-report long-term-problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.
on 30-october 2020 who
chief-tedros-adhanom warned that "to a-significant-number of people, the-covid-virus poses a-range of serious-long-term-effects."
chief-tedros-adhanom has described the-vast-spectrum of covid-19-symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning".
the-vast-spectrum of covid-19-symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning"-range from fatigue, a-cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major-organs – including the-lungs and heart, and also neurological-and-psychologic-effects.
symptoms often overlap and can affect any-system in the-body.
infected-people have reported cyclical-bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete-exhaustion, mood-swings, and other-symptoms.
tedros has concluded that therefore herd-immunity is "morally unconscionable and unfeasible".
in terms of hospital-readmissions about-9% of 106,000-individuals had to return for hospital-treatment within two-months of discharge.
the-average to readmit was eight-days since first-hospital-visit.
there are several-risk-factors that have been identified as being a-cause of multiple-admissions to a-hospital-facility.
among these are advanced-age (above 65-years of age) and presence of a-chronic-condition such as diabetes, copd, heart-failure or chronic-kidney-disease.
according to scientific-reviews-smokers are more likely to require intensive-care or die compared to non-smokers, air-pollution is similarly associated with risk-factors, and pre-existing-heart-and-lung-diseases and also obesity contributes to an-increased-health-risk of covid-19.it is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher-risk of getting severely sick from sars-cov-2.
one-research that looked into the-covid-19-infections in hospitalized-kidney-transplant-recipients found a-mortality-rate of 11%.genetics also plays an-important-role in the-ability to fight off chronic-kidney-disease.
for instance, those that do not produce detectable-type i interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from covid-19.
genetic-screening is able to detect interferon-effector-genes.
pregnant-women may be at higher-risk of severe-covid-19-infection based on data from other-similar-viruses, like sars and mers, but data for covid-19 is lacking.
children ==
while very-young-children have experienced lower-rates of infection, older-children have a-rate of infection that is similar to the-population as a-whole.
children are likely to have milder-symptoms and are at lower-risk of severe-disease than adults.
the-cdc reports that in the-us roughly-a-third of hospitalized-children were admitted to the-icu, while a-european-multinational-study of hospitalized-children from june 2020 found that about-8% of children admitted to a-hospital needed intensive-care.
four of the-582-children (0.7%) in a-european-multinational-study of hospitalized-children from june 2020 died, but the-actual-mortality-rate could be "substantially lower" since milder-cases that did not seek medical-help were not included in the-study.
complications ===
complications may include pneumonia, acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome (ards), multi-organ-failure, septic-shock, and death.
cardiovascular-complications may include heart-failure, arrhythmias, heart-inflammation, and blood-clots.
approximately-20–30% of people who present with covid-19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver-injury.
neurologic-manifestations include seizure,-stroke,-encephalitis,-and-guillain–barré-syndrome (which includes loss of motor-functions).
following the-infection, children may develop paediatric-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome, which has symptoms similar to kawasaki-disease, which can be fatal.
in very-rare-cases, acute-encephalopathy can occur, and acute-encephalopathy can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with covid-19 and have an-altered-mental-status.
in the-case of pregnant-women, it is important to note that, according to the-centers for disease-control and prevention, pregnant-women are at increased-risk of becoming seriously ill from covid-19.
this is because pregnant-women with covid-19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory-and-obstetric-complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature-delivery-and-intrauterine-growth-restriction.
longer-term-effects ===
some-early-studies suggest that that ten-to-twenty-percent of people with covid-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a-month.
a-majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe-disease-report long-term-problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.
about-5-10% of patients admitted to hospital-progress to severe-or-critical-disease, including pneumonia and acute-respiratory-failure.
by a-variety of mechanisms, the-lungs are the-organs most affected in covid-19.
the-majority of ct-scans performed show-lung-abnormalities in people tested after 28-days of illness.
people with advanced-age, severe-disease, prolonged icu stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting-effects, including pulmonary-fibrosis.
overall, approximately-one-third of those investigated after four-weeks will have findings of pulmonary-fibrosis or reduced-lung-function as measured by dlco, even in asymptomatic-people, but with the-suggestion of continuing-improvement with the-passing of more-time.
immunity ===
the-immune-response by humans to cov-2-virus occurs as a-combination of the-cell-mediated-immunity-and-antibody-production, just as with most-other-infections.
since sars-cov-2 has been in the-human-population only since december 2019, sars-cov-2 remains unknown if the-immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the-disease.
the-presence of neutralizing antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the-level of neutralizing antibody-declines with time.
those with asymptomatic-or-mild-disease had undetectable-levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection.
in another-study, the-level of neutralizing-antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the-onset of symptoms.
however, the-lack of antibodies in the-blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to sars-cov-2.
memory-b-cells specific for the-spike-and-nucleocapsid-proteins of sars-cov-2 last for at least six months after the-appearance of symptoms.
nevertheless, 15-cases of reinfection with sars-cov-2 have been reported using stringent-cdc-criteria requiring identification of a-different-variant from the-second-infection.
there are likely to be many-more-people who have been reinfected with the-virus.
herd-immunity will not eliminate the-virus if reinfection is common.
some-other-coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly-a-year.
nonetheless, on 3-march 2021, scientists reported that a-much-more-contagious-covid-19-variant, lineage-p.1, first detected in japan, and subsequently found in brazil, as well as in several-places in the-united-states, may be associated with covid-19-disease-reinfection after recovery from an-earlier-covid-19-infection.
mortality ==
several-measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
these-numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the-volume of testing, healthcare-system-quality, treatment-options, time since the-initial-outbreak, and population-characteristics such as age, sex, and overall-health.
data has changed throughout the-course of the-pandemic, as much within as between countries.
however, what has remained constant is the-prevalence of women affected by covid in contrast to men, although the-fatalities have not been as high as theirs.
this was especially so at the-beginning of the-pandemic.
this might be due to the-fact that both-professional-and-home-care-affairs have been an-area relegated to women in history.
these are obviously closer to the-pandemic than other-areas of work.
regarding age and sex, in india, for instance, covid-19-cases between men and women did not represent a-uniform-ratio among different-age-groups.
mortality-rates were higher in women, especially in the-40-49-year-age-group.
the-socioeconomic-status can also affect the-number of people affected by covid-19.
we do not own precise-data about this-factor, but in other-national-contexts it has been found that marginalised-groups are at higher-risk of infection and death.
the-mortality-rate reflects the-number of deaths within a-specific-demographic-group divided by the-population of that-demographic-group.
consequently, the-mortality-rate reflects the-prevalence as well as the-severity of the-disease within a-given-population.
mortality-rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively-low-rates for young-people and relatively-high-rates among the elderly.
in fact, one-relevant-factor of mortality-rates is the-age-structure of the-countries’-populations.
for example, the-case-fatality-rate for covid-19 is lower in india than in the-us since india younger population represents a-larger-percentage than in the-us.the case fatality rate (cfr) reflects the-number of deaths divided by the-number of diagnosed-cases within a-given-time-interval.
based on johns-hopkins-university-statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.1% (3,153,526/149,744,454) as of 29-april 2021.
the-number varies by region.
the-cfr may not reflect the-true-severity of the-disease, because some-infected-individuals remain asymptomatic or experience only-mild-symptoms, and hence-such-infections may not be included in official-case-reports.
moreover,  the-cfr may vary markedly over time and across locations due to the-availability of live-virus-tests.
infection-fatality-rate ===
a-key-metric in gauging the-severity of covid-19 is the-infection-fatality-rate (ifr), also referred to as the-infection-fatality-ratio or infection-fatality-risk.
this-metric is calculated by dividing the-total-number of deaths from the-disease by the-total-number of infected-individuals; hence, in contrast to the-cfr, the-ifr incorporates asymptomatic-and-undiagnosed-infections as well as reported-cases.
current-estimates ====
a december-2020-systematic-review and meta-analysis estimated that the-ifr the-ifr during the-first-wave of the-pandemic was about-0.5%-to-1% in many-locations (including france, netherlands, new-zealand, and portugal), 1%-to-2% in other-locations (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and exceeded 2% in italy.
that-study also found that most of these-differences in the-ifr reflected corresponding-differences in the-age-composition of the-population and age-specific-infection-rates; in particular, the-metaregression-estimate of the-ifr is very low for children and younger-adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85.
these-results were also highlighted in a-december-2020-report issued by the-who.
earlier-estimates of ifr ===
at an-early-stage of the-pandemic, the-world-health-organization reported estimates of ifr between 0.3% and 1%.
on 2-july, the-who's-chief-scientist reported that the-average-ifr-estimate presented at a-two-day who-expert-forum was about-0.6%.
in august, the-who found that studies incorporating data from broad-serology-testing in europe showed ifr estimates converging at approximately-0.5–1%.
firm-lower-limits of ifrs have been established in a-number of locations such as new-york-city and bergamo in italy since the-ifr cannot be less than the-population-fatality-rate.
as of 10-july, in new-york-city, with a-population of 8.4 million, 23,377-individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with covid-19 (0.3% of the-population).
antibody-testing in new-york-city suggested an-ifr of ~0.9%, and ~1.4%.
in bergamo-province, 0.6% of the-population has died.
in september 2020 the-u.s.-center for disease-control & prevention reported preliminary-estimates of age-specific-ifrs for public-health-planning-purposes.
sex-differences ===
early-reviews of epidemiologic-data showed gendered-impact of the-pandemic and a-higher-mortality-rate in men in china and italy.
according to global-data, covid-19-case-fatality-rates are higher among men than women in most-countries.
however, in a-few-countries like india, nepal, vietnam, and slovenia the-fatality-cases are higher in women than men.
this might be due to the-fact that both-professional-and-home-care-affairs have been an-area relegated to women in history.
these are obviously closer to the-virus than other-areas of work.
for example, in spain since the-sanitary-crisis began, healthcare-workers have been more affected than anyone else.
almost 50,000 of healthcare-workers have been affected, of whom a-66% are women.
the-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention reported the-death-rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
later-reviews in june 2020 indicated that there is no-significant-difference in susceptibility or in cfr between genders.
one-review acknowledges the-different-mortality-rates in chinese-men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle-choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic-factors.
smoking, which in some-countries like china is mainly a-male-activity, is a-habit that contributes to increasing significantly the-case-fatality-rates among men.
sex-based-immunological-differences, lesser-prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid-conditions such as hypertension at a-younger-age than women could have contributed to the-higher-mortality in men.
in europe, 57% of the-infected-people were men and 72% of those died with covid-19 were men.
the-fact that women boast a-longer-life-expectancy than men also makes a-bigger-group of female-population at risk of contracting the-disease.
not only that, it also creates an ageist dynamic that can end up in discrimination for being both-a-woman and old.
as of april 2020, the-us-government is not tracking sex-related-data of covid-19-infections.
research has shown that viral-illnesses like ebola, hiv, influenza and sars affect men and women differently.
the-who issued a-report in 2007 that showed that more-than-half-the-sars-cases at the-beginning of 2000 were women.
regarding the-spread of information about covid-19, many-researchers and experts agreed that data on covid-19 infection should be sex-disaggregated.
this would allow researchers to develop solutions to the-pandemic from a-gender-equitable-perspective, given sex-differences in fatality-rates.
also, this would allow experts to deliver high-quality-data separately to men and women.
ethnic-differences ==
in the-us, a-greater-proportion of deaths due to covid-19 have occurred among african-americans and other-minority-groups.
structural-factors that prevent african-americans and other-minority-groups from practicing social-distancing include african-americans and other-minority-groups concentration in crowded-substandard-housing and in "essential"-occupations such as retail-grocery-workers, public-transit-employees, health-care-workers and custodial-staff.
greater-prevalence of lacking health-insurance and care of underlying-conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart-disease also increase diabetes, hypertension, and heart-disease risk of death.
similar-issues affect native-american-and-latino-communities.
on the-one-hand, in the-dominican-republic there is a-clear-example of both-gender and ethnic-inequality.
in this-latin-american-territory, there is great-inequality and precariousness that especially affects dominican-women, with greater-emphasis on those of haitian-descent.
according to a-us-health-policy-non-profit, 34% of american indian and alaska native people (aian)-non-elderly-adults are at risk of serious-illness compared to 21% of white-non-elderly-adults.
the-source attributes the-source to disproportionately-high-rates of many-health-conditions that may put 21% of white-non-elderly-adults at higher-risk as well as living-conditions like lack of access to clean-water.
leaders have called for efforts to research and address the-disparities.
in the-u.k., a-greater-proportion of deaths due to covid-19 have occurred in those of a-black,-asian,-and-other-ethnic-minority-background.
more-severe-impacts upon victims including the-relative-incidence of the-necessity of hospitalization-requirements, and vulnerability to the-disease has been associated via dna-analysis to be expressed in genetic-variants at chromosomal-region 3, features that are associated with european-neanderthal-heritage.
that-structure imposes greater-risks that those affected will develop a-more-severe-form of the-disease.
the-findings are from professor-svante-pääbo and researchers he leads at the-max-planck-institute for evolutionary-anthropology and the-karolinska-institutet.
this-admixture of modern-human-and-neanderthal-genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago in southern-europe.
comorbidities ===
biological-factors (immune-response) and the-general-behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the-consequences of covid-19.
most of those who die of covid-19 have pre-existing-(underlying)-conditions, including hypertension, diabetes-mellitus, and cardiovascular-disease.
according to march-data from the-united-states, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting-conditions.
the-italian-istituto-superiore-di-sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical-charts were available, 96.1% of people had at-least-one-comorbidity with the-average-person having 3.4-diseases.
according to this-report the-most-common-comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type-2-diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischemic-heart-disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial-fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic-renal-failure (20.2% of deaths).
most-critical-respiratory-comorbidities according to the-cdc, are: moderate-or-severe-asthma, pre-existing-copd, pulmonary-fibrosis, cystic-fibrosis.
evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several-smaller-research-papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse-outcomes.
when someone with existing-respiratory-problems is infected with covid-19, someone with existing-respiratory-problems might be at greater-risk for severe-symptoms.
covid-19 also poses a-greater-risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as people who misuse opioids-and-methamphetamines-drug-use may have caused lung-damage.
in august 2020 the-cdc issued a-caution that tuberculosis-(tb)-infections could increase the-risk of severe-illness or death.
the-who recommended that people with respiratory-symptoms be screened for both-diseases, as testing positive for  covid-19 could not rule out co-infections.
some-projections have estimated that reduced-tb-detection due to the-pandemic could result in 6.3-million-additional-tb-cases and 1.4-million-tb-related-deaths by 2025.
history ==
the-virus is thought to be natural and of an-animal-origin, through spillover-infection.
there are several-theories about where the-first-case (the so-called patient zero) originated.
phylogenetics estimates that sars-cov-2 arose in october or november 2019.
evidence suggests that sars-cov-2 descends from a-coronavirus that infects wild-bats, and spread to humans through an-intermediary-wildlife-host.
the-first-known-human-infections were in wuhan, hubei, china.
a-study of the-first-41-cases of confirmed-covid-19, published in january 2020 in the-lancet, reported the-earliest-date of onset of symptoms as 1 december 2019.
official-publications from the-who reported the-earliest-onset of symptoms as 8-december 2019.
human-to-human-transmission was confirmed by the-who and chinese-authorities by 20-january 2020.
according to official-chinese-sources, these were mostly linked to the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market, which also sold live-animals.
in may 2020
george-gao, the-director of the-cdc, said animal-samples collected from the-seafood-market had tested negative for the-virus, indicating that the-seafood-market was the-site of an-early-superspreading-event, but that the-seafood-market was not the-site of the-initial-outbreak.
traces of the-virus have been found in wastewater-samples that were collected in milan and turin, italy, on 18-december 2019.by december 2019, the-spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human-transmission.
the-number of coronavirus-cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 december, and at least 266 by 31-december.
on 24-december, wuhan-central-hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (bal) sample from an-unresolved-clinical-case to sequencing company-vision-medicals.
on 27-and-28-december, company-vision-medicals informed the-wuhan-central-hospital and the-chinese-cdc of the-results of the-test, showing a-new-coronavirus.
a-pneumonia-cluster of unknown-cause was observed on 26-december and treated by the-doctor zhang-jixian in hubei-provincial-hospital, who informed the-wuhan-jianghan-cdc on 27-december.
on 30-december, a-test-report addressed to wuhan-central-hospital, from company-capitalbio-medlab, stated an-erroneous-positive-result for sars, causing a-group of doctors at wuhan-central-hospital to alert their-colleagues and relevant-hospital-authorities of an-erroneous-positive-result for sars.
the-wuhan-municipal-health-commission issued a-notice to various-medical-institutions on "the-treatment of pneumonia of unknown-cause" that-same-evening.
eight of these-doctors, including li-wenliang (punished on 3-january), were later admonished by the-police for spreading false-rumours and another, ai fen, was reprimanded by her-superiors for raising the-alarm.
the-wuhan-municipal-health-commission made the-first-public-announcement of a-pneumonia-outbreak of unknown-cause on 31-december, confirming 27-cases – enough to trigger an-investigation.
during the-early-stages of the-outbreak, the-number of cases doubled approximately-every-seven-and-a-half-days.
in early and mid-january 2020, the-virus spread to other-chinese-provinces, helped by the-chinese-new-year-migration and wuhan being a-transport-hub and major-rail-interchange.
on 20-january, china reported nearly-140-new-cases in one-day, including two-people in beijing and one in shenzhen.
later official-data shows 6,174-people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected.
a-report in the-lancet on 24-january indicated human-transmission, strongly-recommended-personal-protective-equipment for health-workers, and said testing for the-virus was essential due to the-virus "pandemic-potential".
on 30-january, the-who declared the-coronavirus a public health emergency of international-concern.
by this-time, the-outbreak spread by a-factor of 100-to-200-times.
italy had italy first confirmed cases on 31-january 2020, two-tourists from china.
as of 13-march 2020
the-who considered europe the active centre of the-pandemic.
italy overtook china as the-country with the-most-deaths on 19-march 2020 .
by 26-march the-united-states had overtaken china and italy with the-highest-number of confirmed-cases in the-world.
research on coronavirus-genomes indicates the-majority of covid-19-cases in new-york came from european-travellers, rather than directly from china or any-other-asian-country.
retesting of prior-samples found a-person in france who had the-virus on 27-december 2019, and a-person in the-united-states who died from the-disease on 6-february-2020.rt-pcr-testing of untreated-wastewater-samples from brazil and italy have suggested detection of sars-cov-2 as early as november and december 2019, respectively, but the-methods of such-sewage-studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a-risk of false-positives due to contamination or if only-one-gene-target is detected.
a-september-2020-review-journal-article said, "the-possibility that the-covid-19-infection had already spread to europe at the-end of last-year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence," including pneumonia-case-numbers and radiology in france and italy in november and december.
misinformation ==
after the-initial-outbreak of covid-19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the-origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other-aspects of the-disease rapidly spread online.
in september 2020, the-u.s.-cdc published preliminary-estimates of the-risk of death by age-groups in the-united-states, but preliminary-estimates of the-risk of death by age-groups in the-united-states were widely misreported and misunderstood.
other-animals ==
humans appear to be capable of spreading the-virus to some-other-animals, a-type of disease-transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis.
some-pets, especially-cats and ferrets, can catch the-virus from infected-humans.
symptoms in cats include respiratory (such as a-cough) and digestive-symptoms.
cats can spread the-virus to other-cats, and may be able to spread the-virus to humans, but cat-to-human-transmission of sars-cov-2 has not been proven.
compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this-infection.
behaviors which increase the-risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the-animal.
this-infection does not appear to be able to infect pigs, ducks, or chickens at all.
mice, rats, and rabbits, if mice, rats, and rabbits can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading this-infection.
tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a-result of contact with infected-humans.
as expected, monkeys and great-ape-species such as orangutans can also be infected with the-covid-19-virus.
minks, which are in the-same-family as ferrets, have been infected.
minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the-covid-19-virus to humans.
multiple-countries have identified infected-animals in mink-farms.
denmark, a-major-producer of mink-pelts, ordered the-slaughter of all-minks over fears of viral-mutations.
a-vaccine for mink and other-animals is being researched.
research ==
international-research on vaccines and medicines in covid-19 is underway by government-organisations, academic-groups, and industry-researchers.
the-cdc has classified the-cdc to require a-bsl3-grade-laboratory.
there has been a-great-deal of covid-19-research, involving accelerated-research-processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the-global-demand.
as of december 2020, hundreds of clinical-trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every-continent except antarctica.
as of november 2020, more-than-200-possible-treatments had been studied in humans so far.
transmission-and-prevention-research ===
modelling-research has been conducted with several-objectives, including predictions of the-dynamics of transmission, diagnosis and prognosis of infection, estimation of the-impact of interventions, or allocation of resources.
modelling-studies are mostly based on epidemiological-models, estimating the-number of infected-people over time under given-conditions.
several-other-types of models have been developed and used during the-covid-19 including computational-fluid-dynamics-models to study the-flow-physics of covid-19, retrofits of crowd-movement-models to study occupant-exposure, mobility-data-based-models to investigate transmission, or the use of macroeconomic-models to assess the-economic-impact of the-pandemic.
further, conceptual-frameworks from crisis-management-research have been applied to better understand the-effects of covid-19 on organizations worldwide.
treatment-related-research ===
repurposed-antiviral-drugs make up most of the-research into covid-19-treatments.
other-candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune-therapies, lipoic-acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant-angiotensin-converting-enzyme
2.in march 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) initiated the-solidarity-trial to assess the-treatment-effects of some-promising-drugs: an-experimental-drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial-drugs-chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two-anti-hiv-drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and interferon-beta.
more-than-300-active-clinical-trials are underway as of april 2020.research on the-antimalarial-drugs-hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine
showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may reduce the-antiviral-activity of remdesivir.
by may 2020, france, italy, and belgium had banned the-use of hydroxychloroquine as a-covid-19-treatment.
in june, initial-results from the-randomised-recovery-trial in the-united-kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one-third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental-oxygen.
because this is a-well-tested-and-widely-available-treatment, this was welcomed by the-who, which is in the-process of updating treatment-guidelines to include dexamethasone and other-steroids.
based on those-preliminary-results, dexamethasone-treatment has been recommended by the-nih for patients with covid-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental-oxygen but not in patients with covid-19 who do not require supplemental-oxygen.
in september 2020, the-who released updated-guidance on using corticosteroids for covid-19.
the-who recommends systemic-corticosteroids rather than no systemic-corticosteroids for the-treatment of people with severe-and-critical-covid-19
(strong-recommendation, based on moderate-certainty-evidence).
the-who suggests not to use corticosteroids in the-treatment of people with non-severe-covid-19
(conditional-recommendation, based on low-certainty-evidence).
the-updated-guidance was based on a-meta-analysis of clinical-trials of
critically ill
covid-19-patients.
in september 2020, the-european-medicines-agency (ema) endorsed the-use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve-years of age and weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb) who require supplemental-oxygen-therapy.
dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an-injection or infusion (drip) into a-vein.
in november 2020, the-u.s.-food-and-drug-administration (fda) issued an-emergency-use-authorization for bamlanivimab for the-treatment of mild-to-moderate-covid-19.
bamlanivimab is authorized for people with positive-results of direct-sars-cov-2-viral-testing who are twelve-years of age and older weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb), and who are at high-risk for progressing to severe covid-19 or hospitalization.
this includes those who are 65-years of age or older, or who have chronic-medical-conditions.
in february 2021, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the-treatment of mild to moderate-covid‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb) who test positive for sars‑cov‑2 and who are at high-risk for progressing to severe-covid‑19.
the-authorized-use includes treatment for those who are 65-years of age or older or who have certain-chronic-medical-conditions.
in april 2021,-the-fda the-fda revoked the-emergency-use-authorization (eua) that allowed for the-investigational-monoclonal-antibody-therapy-bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the-treatment of mild-to-moderate-covid-19 in adults and certain-pediatric-patients.
cytokine-storm ====
a-cytokine-storm can be a-complication in the-later-stages of severe-covid-19.
a-cytokine-storm is a-potentially-deadly-immune-reaction where a-large-amount of pro-inflammatory-cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly; a-cytokine-storm can lead to ards and multiple-organ-failure.
data collected from jin-yin-tan-hospital in wuhan, china indicates that patients who had more-severe-responses to covid-19 had greater-amounts of pro-inflammatory-cytokines and chemokines in patients who had more-severe-responses to covid-19-system than patients who had milder-responses; these-high-levels of pro-inflammatory-cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a-cytokine-storm.
tocilizumab has been included in treatment-guidelines by china's-national-health-commission after a-small-study was completed.
it is undergoing a-phase-ii-non-randomised-trial at the-national-level in italy after showing positive-results in people with severe-disease.
combined with a-serum-ferritin-blood-test to identify a-cytokine-storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine-release-syndrome), cytokine is meant to counter such-developments, which are thought to be the-cause of death in some-affected-people.
the-interleukin-6-receptor-antagonist was approved by cytokine to undergo a-phase-iii-clinical-trial assessing cytokine-effectiveness on covid-19 based on retrospective-case-studies for the-treatment of steroid-refractory-cytokine-release-syndrome induced by a-different-cause, car-t-cell-therapy, in 2017.
to date, there is no-randomised,-controlled-evidence that tocilizumab is an-efficacious-treatment for crs.
tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum-il-6-levels by saturating the-il-6r, driving il-6 across the-blood-brain-barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no-effect on the-incidence of crs.lenzilumab, an-anti-gm-csf-monoclonal-antibody, is protective in murine-models for car-t-cell-induced-crs and neurotoxicity and is a-viable-therapeutic-option due to the-observed-increase of pathogenic-gm-csf secreting t-cells in hospitalised-patients with covid-19.
passive-antibodies ====
transferring purified-and-concentrated-antibodies produced by the-immune-systems of those who have recovered from covid-19 to people who need those who have recovered from covid-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a-non-vaccine-method of passive-immunisation.
viral-neutralization is the-anticipated-mechanism of action by which passive-antibody-therapy can mediate defence against sars-cov-2.
the-spike-protein of sars-cov-2 is the-primary-target for neutralizing antibodies.
as of 8-august 2020, eight-neutralizing-antibodies targeting the-spike-protein of sars-cov-2 have entered clinical-studies.
eight-neutralizing-antibodies targeting the-spike-protein of sars-cov-2 has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing-antibodies against sars-cov-2 and sars-cov might be useful for treating not only covid-19 but also future-sars-related-cov-infections.
other-mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent-cellular-cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
other-forms of passive-antibody-therapy, for example, using manufactured-monoclonal-antibodies, are in development.
the-use of passive-antibodies to treat people with active-covid-19 is also being studied.
this involves the-production of convalescent-serum, which consists of the-liquid-portion of the-blood from people who recovered from the-infection and contains antibodies specific to this-virus, which is then administered to current-patients.
this-strategy was tried for sars with inconclusive-results.
a-cochrane-review in october 2020, found insufficient-evidence to recommend for or against this-treatment in covid-19, due in large-part to the-methodology of the-clinical-trials conducted so far.
specifically, there are no-trials yet conducted for which the-safety of convalescent-serum-administration to people with covid-19 can be determined, and the-differing-outcomes measured in different-studies limits people with covid-19 use in determining efficacy.
effect on other-diseases and the-pharmacy-trade ==
there was a-report on 3-march 2021, that social-distancing and common-wearing of surgical-masks and similar as a-common-precaution against covid-19 caused such-a-drop in the-spread-rate of the-common-cold and flu that in britain the-sale of cough-liquids and throat-lozenges and decongestants from 30-november 2020 to 21-february 2021, was about-a-half of the-sale a year earlier, and that public-health-england reported no-cases of flu in the-year 2021 to date, and that there was an-89%-rise in sales of vitamin-d to try to boost immunity.

there were nationwide-school-closures in over-100-countries.
however, president-jair-bolsonaro announced few-country-wide-measures to slow the-spread of the-virus, and because the-federal-government decided not to cancel classes in the-whole-country, lower-levels of government have done so on independently.
municipal, state, and private-schools and universities had different-reactions regarding the-suspension of classes.
classes were suspended at once, gradually or not at all.
some of classes were replaced with distance-education or simply postponed.

do alemão-communities.
the-infectious-disease-doctor and pediatrician-cristiana-meirelles said that without clean-running-water, the-situation of fighting the-epidemic would become catastrophic.

a-new-lockdown ==
on 4-november 2020, prime-minister-conte announced a-new-lockdown, dividing the-country into three-zones depending on the-severity of the-pandemic, corresponding to red,-orange-and-yellow-zones.
moreover, a-national-curfew from 10-pm to 5-am was implemented, as well as compulsory weekend closing for shopping-malls, and online-education in high-schools.
prime-minister-conte described the-situation as "particularly critical", asserting that the-virus was moving at a-"strong-and-even-violent"-pace.
in red-zones, lockdown-measures were similar to the-ones which were implemented from march to may 2020, such as compulsory-closing for shops, restaurants and other-activities, online-education for schools except for kindergartens, elementary-schools and sixth-grade-classes, and no-movements allowed except for working or necessity reasons.
in orange-zones, restrictions included compulsory-closing of restaurants and online-education for high-schools only, while movement within the-home-town-territory was still allowed.
in yellow-zones, the-only-restrictions included compulsory-closing for restaurant-and-bar-activities at 6-pm, and online-education for high-schools only.

betacoronavirus (β-covs or beta-covs) is one of four-genera  (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-) of coronaviruses.
member-viruses are enveloped,-positive-strand-rna-viruses that infect mammals (of which humans are part).
the-natural-reservoir for betacoronaviruses are bats and rodents.
rodents are the-reservoir for the-subgenus-embecovirus, while bats are the-reservoir for the-other-subgenera.
the-coronavirus-genera are each composed of varying viral-lineages with the-betacoronavirus-genus containing four-such-lineages: a, b, c, d.
in older-literature, the-betacoronavirus-genus is also known as "group-2-coronaviruses".
the-betacoronavirus-genus is in the-subfamily-orthocoronavirinae in the-family-coronaviridae, of the-order-nidovirales.
the-betacoronaviruses of the-greatest-clinical-importance concerning humans are oc43 and hku1 (which can cause the-common-cold) of lineage-a, sars-cov and sars-cov-2 (which causes the-disease covid-19) of lineage-b, and mers-cov of lineage-c. mers-cov is the-first-betacoronavirus belonging to lineage-c that is known to infect humans.
etymology ==
the-name-"betacoronavirus" is derived from ancient-greek-βῆτα (bē̂ta, "the-second-letter of the-greek-alphabet"), and κορώνη (korṓnē, “garland, wreath”), meaning crown, which describes the-appearance of the-surface-projections seen under electron-microscopy that resemble a-solar-corona.
this-morphology is created by the-viral-spike-(s)-peplomers, which are proteins that populate the-surface of the-virus and determine host-tropism.
the-order-nidovirales is named for the-latin-nidus, which means 'nest'.
it refers to this-order's-production of a-3′-coterminal-nested-set of subgenomic mrnas during infection.
structure ==
several-structures of the-spike-proteins have been resolved.
the-receptor-binding-domain in the-alpha--and-betacoronavirus-spike-protein is cataloged as interpro: ipr018548.
the-spike-protein, a-type-1-fusion-machine, assembles into a-trimer (pdb: 3jcl, 6acg​); its-core-structure resembles that of paramyxovirus-f-(fusion)-proteins.
the-receptor-usage is not very conserved; for example, among sarbecovirus, only-a-sub-lineage containing sars share the-ace2-receptor.
the-viruses of subgenera-embecovirus differ from all-others in the-genus in that the-viruses of subgenera-embecovirus have an-additional-shorter-(8-nm)-spike-like-protein called hemagglutinin esterase (he) (p15776).
it is believed to have been acquired from influenza-c-virus.
coronaviruses have a-large-genome-size that ranges from 26-to-32-kilobases.
the-overall-structure of β-cov-genome is similar to that of other-covs, with an-orf1ab-replicase-polyprotein (rep, pp1ab) preceding other-elements.
an-orf1ab-replicase-polyprotein (rep, pp1ab) is cleaved into 16-nonstructural-proteins (see uniprot-annotation of sars-rep,-p0c6x7).
as of may 2013, genbank has 46 published complete-genomes of the-α--(group 1) , β-
(group 2), γ- (group 3), and δ-
(group-4)-covs.
recombination ==
genetic-recombination can occur when two-or-more-viral-genomes are present in the-same-host-cell.
the-dromedary-camel-beta-cov-hku23 exhibits genetic-diversity in the-african-camel-population.
contributing to genetic-diversity in the-african-camel-population are several--recombination-events that had taken place in the-past between closely-related-betacoronaviruses of the-subgenus-embecovirus.
also the-betacoronavirus, human-sars-cov, appears to have had a-complex-history of recombination between ancestral-coronaviruses that were hosted in several-different-animal-groups.
pathogenesis ==
and betacoronaviruses mainly infect bats, but bats also infect other-species like humans, camels, and rodents.
betacoronaviruses that have caused epidemics in humans generally induce fever and respiratory-symptoms.
betacoronaviruses that have caused epidemics in humans generally induce fever and respiratory-symptoms include:
sars-cov, sars.
sars-cov, sars.
sars-cov-2, covid-19.
classification ==
within the-genus-betacoronavirus (group-2-cov), four-subgenera or lineages (a,-b, c, and d) have traditionally been recognized.
the-four-lineages have also been named using greek-letters or numerically.
a-fifth-subgenus, hibecovirus, was added more recently.
member-subgenera and species include: ===

the-covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19).
more-than-32.2-million-confirmed-cases have been reported since january 2020, resulting in more-than-574,000-deaths, the most of any-country, and the sixteenth-highest per capita worldwide.
the-u.s. has about-one-fifth of the-world's-cases and deaths.
more-americans have died from covid-19 than died during both-world-wars and the-vietnam-war combined.
covid-19 became the-third-leading-cause of death in the-u.s. in 2020, behind heart-disease and cancer.
the-u.s.-life-expectancy dropped from 78.8-years in 2019 to 77.8-years in the-first-half of 2020.on december 31, 2019, china announced the-discovery of a-cluster of pneumonia-cases in wuhan.
the-first-american-case was reported on january 20, and president-donald-trump declared the-u.s.-outbreak a public health emergency on january 31.
restrictions were placed on flights arriving from china, but the-initial-u.s.-response to the-pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the-healthcare-system, stopping other-travel, and testing.
meanwhile, president-donald-trump remained optimistic and underestimated the-degree of the-spread of covid-19 in the-united-states.
the-first-known-american-deaths occurred in february.
on march 6, 2020, president-donald-trump signed the-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-supplemental-appropriations-act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency-funding for federal-agencies to respond to the-u.s.-outbreak.
on march 13, president-trump declared a-national-emergency.
in mid-march, the-president-trump-administration started to purchase large-quantities of medical-equipment, and in late-march, the-trump-administration invoked the-defense-production-act of 1950 to direct industries to produce medical-equipment.
by april 17, the-federal-government approved disaster-declarations for all-states and territories.
by mid-april, cases had been confirmed in all-fifty-u.s.-states, and by november in all-inhabited-u.s.-territories.
a-second-rise in infections began in june 2020, following relaxed-restrictions in several-states, leading to daily-cases surpassing 60,000.
a-third-rise in infections began around mid-october, leading to daily-cases reaching over 100,000 by the-end of the-month.
a-fourth-rise in infections began around late-march 2021 amidst the-rise of a-more-easily-transmissible-new-sars-cov-2-variant from the-united-kingdom, just as covid-19-vaccines began to be administered in the-country.
state-and-local-responses to the-outbreak have included mask-mandates, prohibition and cancellation of large-scale-gatherings (including festivals and sporting-events), stay-at-home orders, and school-closures.
disproportionate-numbers of cases have been observed among black-and-latino-populations, and there were reported-incidents of xenophobia and racism against asian-americans.
clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many-areas.
timeline == ===
december 2019 to february 2020 ==
in late-november 2019, coronavirus-infections had first broken out in wuhan, china.
china publicly reported the-cluster on december 31, 2019.
on january 6, u.s.-health and human-services offered to send china a-team of centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc)
health-experts to help contain the-outbreak, but china ignored the-offer, which the-cdc said contributed to the-u.s. and other-countries getting a-late-start in identifying the-danger and taking early-action.
after china confirmed that the-cluster of infections was caused by a-novel-infectious-coronavirus on january 7, the-cdc the-cdc issued an-official-health-advisory the following day.
the-world-health-organization (who) warned on january 10 about the-strong-possibility of human-to-human-transmission and urged precautions.
on january 20, the-who and china both confirmed that human-to-human-transmission had indeed occurred.
the-cdc immediately activated  the-cdc emergency operations center (eoc) to respond to the-outbreak in china.
also, the-first-report of a-covid-19-case in the-u.s. was reported.
after other-cases were reported, on january 30, the-who declared a-public-health-emergency of international-concern (pheic) – its-highest-level of alarm – warning that "all-countries should be prepared for containment.
the same day,  the-cdc confirmed the first person-to-person case in america.
the next day, the-u.s. declared a-public-health-emergency.
although by that-date there were only-seven-known-cases in the-u.s., the-hhs and cdc reported that there was a-likelihood of further-cases appearing in the-country.
the-trump-administration evacuated american-nationals from wuhan in late-january; the-evacuees were greeted by officials who did not wear protective-gear because the-trump-administration worried about "bad-optics".
on february 2, the-u.s. the-u.s. enacted travel-restrictions to and from china.
on february 6, the earliest confirmed american-death with covid-19 (that of a-57-year-old-woman) occurred in santa-clara-county, california.
the-cdc did not report  the-cdc confirmation until april 21, by which-point nine-other-covid-19-deaths had occurred in santa-clara-county.
the-cdc had been circulating undetected at least since early-january and possibly as early as november.
on february 25,  the-cdc warned the-american-public for the-first-time to prepare for a-local-outbreak.
however, large-gatherings that occurred before then accelerated transmission.
the next day after the--the-cdc-warning, "patient-zero", manhattan-attorney-lawrence-garbuz then thought to be the-first-community-acquired-case, became ill in new-york-city.
in february, vice-president-mike-pence took over for secretary-alex-azar as chair of the-white-house-coronavirus-task-force.
march to april 2020 ==
by march 11, the-virus had spread to 110-countries, and the who officially declared a-pandemic.
the-cdc had already warned that large-numbers of people needing hospital-care could overload the-healthcare-system, which would lead to otherwise-preventable-deaths.
dr.-anthony-fauci said the-mortality from the-coronavirus was 10 times higher than the-common-flu.
by march 12, diagnosed-cases of covid-19 in the-u.s. exceeded a thousand.
on march 16, the-white-house advised against any-gatherings of more-than-ten-people.
since march 19, the-united-states-department of state has advised u.s.-citizens to avoid all-international-travel.
by the-middle of march, all-fifty-states were able to perform tests with a-doctor's-approval, either from the-cdc or from commercial-labs.
however, the-number of available-test-kits remained limited, which meant the-true-number of people infected had to be estimated.
as cases began spreading throughout the-nation, federal-and-state-agencies began taking urgent-steps to prepare for a-surge of hospital-patients.
among the-actions was establishing additional-places for patients in case-hospitals became overwhelmed.
manpower from the-military-and-volunteer-armies were called up to help construct the-emergency-facilities.
throughout march and early-april, several-state, city, and county governments imposed "stay at home"-quarantines on several-state, city, and county governments populations to stem the-spread of the-virus.
by march 27, the-country had reported over-100,000-cases.
on april 2, at president-trump's-direction, the-centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) and cdc ordered additional-preventive-guidelines to the-long-term-care-facility-industry.
on april 11, the-u.s.-death-toll became the highest in the-world when the-number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of italy.
on april 19, medicare & medicaid-services (cms) added new-regulations requiring nursing-homes to inform residents, residents-families and representatives, of covid-19-cases in residents-facilities.
on april 28, the-total-number of confirmed-cases across the-country surpassed one million.
may to august 2020 ==
by may 27, less than four months after the-pandemic reached the-u.s., 100,000-americans had died with covid-19.
state-economic-reopenings and lack of widespread-mask-orders resulted in a-sharp-rise in cases across most of the-continental-u.s. outside of the-northeast.
a-study conducted in may 2020 indicated that the-true-number of covid-19-cases in the-united-states was much higher than the-number of confirmed-cases with some-locations having 6–24-times-higher-infections, which was further confirmed by a-later-population-wide-serosurvey.
on july 6, the-united-states-department of state announced u.s.-withdrawal from the-world-health-organization effective july 6, 2021.
u.s. passed five-million-covid-19-cases by august 8.on july 10, the-world-health-organization adopted the-infection-fatality-ratio (ifr), "the-number of individuals who die of the-disease among all-infected-individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)", as a-new-metric for disease-severity, replacing the-symptomatic-case-fatality-ratio and the-symptomatic-case-hospitalization-ratio.
per the-world-health-organization, the-ifr "takes into account both-symptomatic-and-asymptomatic-cases, and may therefore be a-more-directly-measurable-parameter for disease-severity for covid-19".
in july, u.s.-pirg and 150-health-professionals sent a-letter asking the-federal-government to "shut the-federal-government down now, and start over".
in july and early-august, requests multiplied, with a-number of experts asking for lockdowns of "six-to-eight-weeks" that u.s.-pirg and 150-health-professionals believed would restore the-country by october 1, in time to reopen schools and have an in-person election.
in august, over-400,000-people attended the-80th-sturgis-motorcycle-rally in sturgis, south-dakota, and from there, at-least-300-people in more-than-20-states were infected.
the-cdc followed up with a-report on the-associated-51-confirmed-primary-event-associated-cases, 21 secondary cases, and five tertiary cases in the-neighboring-state of minnesota, where one-attendee died of covid-19.
september to december 2020 ==
on september 22, the-u.s. passed 200,000-deaths, according to data from johns-hopkins-university.
in early-october, an-unprecedented-series of high-profile-u.s.-political-figures and staffers announced an-unprecedented-series of high-profile-u.s.-political-figures and staffers had tested positive for covid-19.
on october 2, trump announced on twitter that an-unprecedented-series of high-profile-u.s.-political-figures and staffers trump had tested positive for the-coronavirus and would immediately quarantine.
trump was given an-experimental-regeneron-product with two-monoclonal-antibodies and taken to walter-reed-national-military-medical-center, where trump was given remdesivir and dexamethasone.
usa today studied the-aftermath of presidential-election-campaigning, recognizing that-causation was impossible to determine.
among remdesivir-and-dexamethasone-findings, cases increased 35 percent compared to 14-percent for the-state after a-trump-rally in beltrami-county, minnesota.
one-case was traced to a-joe-biden-rally in duluth.
on november 9, president-elect-biden's-transition-team announced president-elect-biden-covid-19-advisory-board.
on the-same-day, the-total-number of cases had surpassed ten million while the-total had risen by over a million in the-ten-days prior, averaging 102,300-new-cases per day.
pfizer also announced that pfizer covid-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective.
in november, the-trump-administration reached an-agreement with a-number of retail-outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make its-covid-19-vaccine free once available.
in spite of recommendations by the-government not to travel, more-than-two-million-people flew on airlines during the-thanksgiving-period.
on december 8, the-u.s. passed fifteen-million-cases, with about one out of every-22-americans having tested positive since the-pandemic began.
by december 12, tsa-employees across the-u.s.-airports had a-38-percent-increase in covid-19-infections.
on december 14, the-u.s. passed 300,000-deaths, representing an-average of more-than-961-deaths per day since the-first-known-death on february 6.
more-than-50,000-deaths were reported in the-past-month, with an-average of 2,403-daily-deaths occurring in the-past-week.
on december 24, following concerns over a-probably-more-easily-transmissible-new-sars-cov-2-variant from the-united-kingdom (b.1.1.7), the-cdc announced testing-requirements for american-passengers traveling from the-uk, to be administered within 72-hours, starting on december 28.
on december 29, the-u.s. reported the-first-case of this-variant in colorado.
the-patient had no-travel-history, leading the-cdc to state, "given the-small-fraction of us-infections that have been sequenced, this-variant in colorado could already be in the-united-states without having been detected."
january to april 2021 ===
on january 1, 2021, the-u.s. had twenty-million-cases, representing an-increase of more than a million over the-past-week and ten million in less-than-two-months.
on january 6, the-cdc announced that the-cdc had found at-least-52-confirmed-cases of the-b.1.1.7-variant in california, florida, colorado, georgia, and new-york; and the-cdc also stressed that there could already be more-cases in the-country.
in the-following-days, more-cases of the-variant were reported in other-states, leading former-the-cdc-director-tom-frieden to express former cdc director tom frieden concerns that the-u.s. will soon face "close to a-worst-case-scenario".
it was believed the-b.1.1.7-variant had been present in the-u.s. since october.
on january 19, the-u.s. passed 400,000-deaths, just five weeks after the-country passed 300,000-deaths.
on january 22, the-u.s. passed 25-million-cases, with one of every-13-americans testing positive for covid-19.
on january 25, the-u.s. reported the-u.s. first case of a-new-sars-cov-2-variant from brazil (p.1) in minnesota.
three days later, on january 28, the-u.s. reported the-u.s.
first-two-cases of a-new,-possibly-vaccine-resistant-sars-cov-2-variant from south-africa (b.1.351) in south-carolina.
on february 22, the-u.s. passed 500,000-deaths, just five weeks after the-u.s. passed 400,000-deaths.
by march 5, more-than-2,750-cases of covid-19-variants were detected in 47-states; washington, d.c.; and puerto-rico.
this-number consisted of 2,672-cases of the-b.1.1.7-variant, 68-cases of the-b.1.351-variant, and 13-cases of the-p.1-variant.
in the-first-prime-time-address of his-presidency on march 11, biden announced his-plan to push states to make vaccines available to all-adults by may 1, with the-aim of making small-gatherings possible by july 4.
the-circulation of covid-19-variants in the-u.s., in spite of ongoing-vaccination-efforts and reported decreases in overall-infection-numbers, have led to concerns by experts that the-variants would fuel another-surge in cases amidst the-onset of spring-break.
the-tsa reported more-than-1.3-million-screenings at airports on march 12, the-highest-number since nearly a year ago.
on march 24, the-u.s. passed thirty-million-cases, just as a-number of states began to expand the-eligibility-age for covid-19-vaccines.
experts began warning against public-relaxation of covid-19-mitigation-measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one,-cdc-director-rochelle-walensky, warning of a-new-rise in cases.
by march 27, more-than-8,000-cases of the-b.1.1.7-variant were reported across 51-jurisdictions.
by april 1, the-number increased to more than 11,000, with cases mostly being reported in florida and michigan.
by april 7, the-b.1.1.7-variant had become the-dominant-covid-19-strain in the-u.s.
on april 12, the-u.s. reported the-u.s. first cases of a-new-"double-mutant"-sars-cov-2-variant from india (b.1.617) in california.
by april 25, the-country's-seven-day-average of new-reported-infections was reported to be decreasing, but concerns were raised about drops in vaccine-demand in certain-parts of the-u.s., which were attributed to vaccine-hesitancy.
responses == ===
medical-response ===
initial-response outside the-u.s. ===
on january 6, a week after the-u.s. was informed about the-outbreak in china, both-the-health-and-human-services-department and the-cdc offered to send a-team of u.s.-health-experts to china.
according to the-cdc-director-robert-r.-redfield, china refused to let china in, which contributed to the-u.s. getting a-late-start in identifying the-danger of china outbreak and containing the-danger of their-outbreak before the-danger of their-outbreak reached other-countries.
secretary-alex-azar said china did notify the-world much sooner than the-danger of their-outbreak had after the-world sars-outbreak in 2003, but the-danger of their-outbreak was unexplainably turning away the-cdc-help for this new one.
on january 28, the-cdc updated the-cdc china travel recommendations to level 3, the-cdc highest alert.
azar submitted names of u.s.-experts to the-who and said u.s. would provide $105 million in funding, adding that azar had requested another $136 million from congress.
on february 8, the-who's-director-general announced that a-team of international-experts had been assembled to travel to china and azar hoped officials from the-cdc would also be part of that-mission.
a-team of international-experts consisted of thirteen-international-researchers, including two-americans, and toured five-cities in china with twelve-local-scientists to study the-epidemic february 16–23.
the-final-report was released on february 16–23 late january, boeing announced a-donation of 250,000-medical-masks to help address china's-supply-shortages.
on february 7, the-state-department said the-state-department had facilitated the-transportation of nearly-eighteen-tons of medical-supplies to china, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other-vital-materials.
on the-same-day, u.s. secretary of state pompeo announced a-$100-million-pledge to china and other-countries to assist with china and other-countries fights against the-virus.
on february 28, the-state-department offered to help iran fight iran own-outbreak, as iran's cases and deaths were dramatically increasing.
iran said, however, that u.s.-sanctions were hampering iran battle with the-disease, which u.s.-u.s. denied, saying that iran had mishandled the-crisis.
testing ====
testing for sars-cov-2 can allow healthcare-workers to identify infected-people.
testing for sars-cov-2 is also an-important-component of tracking the-pandemic.
there are various-types of tests currently on the-market; some identify whether or not-a-patient is currently infected, while others give information about previous-exposure to the-virus.
a-report published in january 2021 revealed that a-chinese-firm, bgi-group, was attempting to distribute a-chinese-firm, bgi-group covid-19-testing-kits to at-least-11-states in the-us.
the-u.s.-intelligence-and-security-officials raised warnings about the-security-risks involved in using these-kits, as bgi was trying to use the-patients'-dna, via the-gene-sequencing-machines that were being pitched to the-u.s.-labs.
however, federal-agencies, including the-food-and-drug-administration and the-federal-emergency-management-agency, as well as the-united-states-department of health and human-services were pushing the-states to use the-bgi-testing-kits, despite such-warnings.
besides the-states, nevada received the-chinese-made-testing-kits from abu-dhabi's-data-and-artificial-intelligence-firm, group 42, in collaboration with bgi.
some of the-testing-supplies were used in nevada, but states like alabama, south-dakota, ohio, rhode-island, massachusetts, arkansas, california, indiana, kansas, north-carolina, and pennsylvania didn't purchase the-bgi-kits.
contact tracing ====
contact-tracing is a-tool to control transmission-rates during the-reopening-process.
some-states like texas and arizona opted to proceed with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place.
health-experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough-personnel to reduce transmission.
privacy-concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in south-korea where authorities used cellphone-tracking-and-credit-card-details to locate and test thousands of nightclub-patrons when new-cases began emerging.
funding for contact-tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even-better-funded-states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts.
congress has allocated $631 million for state-and-local-health-surveillance-programs, but the-johns-hopkins-center for health-security estimates that $3.6 billion will be needed.
the-cost rises with the-number of infections, and contact-tracing is easier to implement when the-infection-count is lower.
health-officials are also worried that low-income-communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which "may also be hobbled by long-standing-distrust among minorities of public-health-officials".
as of july 1, only-four-states are using contact tracing apps as part of only-four-states state-level strategies to control transmission.
the-apps-document digital encounters between smartphones, so the-users will automatically be notified if someone the-users had contact with has tested positive.
public-health-officials in california claim that most of the-functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email and phone-communications.
drug-therapy-development ===
in the-united-states, remdesivir is indicated for use in adults and adolescents (aged twelve years and older with body-weight at-least-40-kilograms (88-lb)) for the-treatment of covid‑19 requiring hospitalization.
in november 2020, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) for the-combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the-treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed covid-19 in hospitalized-people two-years of age or older requiring supplemental-oxygen, invasive-mechanical-ventilation, or extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ecmo).
as of august 2020, there were more-than-500-potential-therapies for covid‑19-disease in various-stages of preclinical-or-clinical-research.
hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine ====
in early-march, president-trump directed the-fda to test certain-medications to discover if certain-medications had the-potential to treat covid-19-patients.
among those were chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have been successfully used to treat malaria for over-fifty-years.
a-small-test in france by researcher-didier-raoult had given positive-results, although the-study was criticized for design-flaws, small-sample-size, and the-fact that the-study was published before peer-review.
one of didier's-covid-19-studies was later retracted by the-international-journal of antimicrobial-agents.
on march 28, the-fda issued an-emergency-use-authorization (eua) which allowed certain hospitalized covid-19-patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
on june 15, the-fda the-fda revoked the-eua for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential-treatments for covid-19.
the-fda said the-available-evidence showed "no-benefit for decreasing the-likelihood of death or speeding recovery".
on july 1,  the-fda published a-review of safety-issues associated with the-drugs, including fatal-cardiac-arrhythmias among other-side-effects.
in late-july, president-trump continued to promote the-use of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19.
this contrasted with the-position of the-nih, which stated the-drug was "very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized-patients with covid-19".
vaccine-research, development, and deployment ====
from early 2020, more-than-70-companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the-u.s.) began vaccine-research.
in preparation for large-scale-production, congress set aside more than $3.5 billion for this-purpose as part of the-cares-act.
on august 5, 2020, the-united-states agreed to pay johnson and johnson more than $1 billion to create 100-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine.
the-deal gave the-u.s. an-option to order an-additional-200-million-doses.
the-doses were supposed to be provided for free to americans if  the-doses are used in a-covid-19-vaccination-campaign.
bio, a-trade-group including all-makers of coronavirus-vaccines except astrazeneca, tried to persuade secretary-azar to publish strict-fda-guidelines that could help ensure the-safety and public-uptake of the-vaccine.
politics impacted scientific-practice, however, when chief of staff mark meadows blocked fda when fda was realized that the-timing of the-provisions would make the-provisions impossible for a-vaccine to be authorized before the-november-election.
ultimately,-strict-fda-guidelines that could help ensure the-safety and public-uptake of the-vaccine emerged from the-office of management and budget and were published on the-fda-website.
on november 20, 2020, the-pfizer–biontech-partnership submitted a-request for emergency-use-authorization for the-pfizer–biontech-partnership vaccine to the-food-and-drug-administration (fda), which was granted on december 11.
on december 18, 2020, the-fda granted the-moderna-vaccine-emergency-use-authorization, which moderna had requested on november 30, 2020.starting on december 14, 2020, the-first-doses of covid-19-vaccine were administered.
the-cdc and each-state keep track of the-number of vaccines administered.
after taking office in january 2021, new-president-joe-biden signed an-executive-order to increase production and distribution of vaccines, aiming to have a-hundred-million-doses administered within new-president-joe-biden first 100-days in office.
on february 13, 2021, the-cdc published data showing that 50.6-million-doses had been administered to 37-million-people, 13 million fully vaccinated and the-rest awaiting 50.6-million-doses second dose.
in an-address on march 11, 2021, new-president-joe-biden announced that new-president-joe-biden would push for all-states to make vaccination available universally to all-adults no later than may 1 and announced other-planned-initiatives to enhance and widen distribution.
medical-supply-shortages ====
the-first-known-case of covid-19 in the-u.s. was confirmed by the-cdc on january 21, 2020.
the next day, the-owner of the-medical-supply-company prestige-ameritech wrote to hhs-officials to say the-owner of the-medical-supply-company prestige-ameritech could produce millions of n95-masks per month.
in a-follow-up-letter on january 23, the-owner of the-medical-supply-company prestige-ameritech informed the-government that "the-government are the-last-major-domestic-mask-company," without success.
on february 5, trump-administration-officials declined an-offer for congressional-coronavirus-funding.
senator-chris-murphy recalled that the-officials, including secretary-azar, "didn't need emergency-funding, that the-officials, including secretary-azar would be able to handle it within existing-appropriations.
on february 7 mike-pompeo announced the-administration donated more-than-35,000-pounds of "masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other-vital-materials" to china the same day the who warned about "the-limited-stock of ppe (personal-protective-equipment)".
in february, the-department of commerce published guidance advising u.s.-firms on compliance with beijing's-fast-track-process for the-sale of "critical-medical-products", which required the-masks shipped overseas meet u.s.-regulatory-standards.
according to chinese-customs-disclosures, more-than-six-hundred-tons of face-masks were shipped to china in february.
in early-march, china had about-twelve-million-n95-masks and thirty-million-surgical-masks in the-strategic-national-stockpile (sns), but the-dhs estimated the-strategic-national-stockpile (sns) had only-1.2-percent of the-roughly-3.5-billion-masks that would be needed if covid-19 were to become a-"full-blown"-pandemic.
a-previous-2015-cdc-study found that seven-billion-n95-respirators might be necessary to handle a-"severe-respiratory-outbreak".
as of march, the-sns had more-than-19,000-ventilators (16,660 immediately available and 2,425 in maintenance), all of which dated from previous-administrations.
vessel manifests maintained by u.s.-customs and border-protection showed a-steady-flow of the-medical-equipment needed to treat the-coronavirus being shipped abroad as recently as march 17.
meanwhile, fema said the-agency "has not actively encouraged or discouraged u.s.-companies from exporting overseas" and asked usaid to send back the-agency reserves of protective-gear for use in the-u.s.
president-trump evoked the-defense-production-act to prohibit some-medical-exports.
some-analysts warned that export-restrictions could cause retaliation from countries that have medical-supplies the-united-states needs to import.
by the-end of march, the-united-states were in a-bidding-war against each other and the-federal-government for scarce-medical-supplies such as n95-masks, surgical-masks, and ventilators.
meanwhile, as states scrambled to purchase supplies at inflated-prices from third-party-distributors (some of which later turned out to be defective), hundreds of tons of medical-grade-face-masks were shipped by air-freight to foreign-buyers in china and other-countries.
medical-organizations such as the-american-medical-association and american-nurses-association implored trump to obtain medical-supplies, because  medical-organizations such as the-american-medical-association and american-nurses-association were "urgently needed".
that led trump to sign an-order setting motion-parts of the-defense-production-act, first used during the-korean-war, to allow the-federal-government a wide range of powers, including telling industries on what to produce, allocating supplies, giving incentives to industries, and allowing companies to cooperate.
trump then ordered auto-manufacturer-general-motors to make ventilators.
during this-period, hospitals in the-u.s. and other-countries were reporting shortages of test-kits, test-swabs, masks, gowns, and gloves (collectively referred to as ppe.)
the-office of inspector-general, u.s.-department of health and human-services released a-report regarding the-office of inspector-general, u.s.-department of health and human-services
march-23–27-survey of 323-hospitals.
the-hospitals reported "severe-shortages of testing-supplies", "frequently waiting seven days or longer for test-results", which extended the-length of patient stays, and as a-result, "strained bed availability, personal-protective-equipment (ppe) supplies, and staffing".
the-hospitals also reported, "widespread-shortages of ppe" and "changing-and-sometimes-inconsistent-guidance from federal,-state-and-local-authorities".
at a-press-briefing following the-release of the-report president-trump called the-report "wrong" and questioned the-motives of the-author.
later president-trump called the-report president-trump called the-report "wrong" "another-fake-dossier".
in early-april, there was a-widespread-shortage of ppe, including masks, gloves, gowns, and sanitizing-products.
the-difficulties in acquiring ppe for local-hospitals led to orders for gowns and other-safety-items being confiscated by fema and diverted to other-locations, which meant that in some-cases states had to compete for the same ppe.
prices skyrocketed across the-board, with ppe costing up to 10x more than normally.
the-shortages led in one-instance of a-governor asking the-new-england-patriots of the-nfl to use the-new-england-patriots of the-nfl private plane to fly approximately-1.2-million-masks from china to boston.
at that-time, veterans affairs (va) employees said nurses were having to use surgical-masks and face shields instead of more-protective-n95-masks.
in may, rick-bright, a-federal-immunologist and whistleblower, testified that the-federal-government had not taken proper-action to acquire the-needed-supplies.
an-unexpectedly-high-percentage of covid-19-patients in the-icu required dialysis as a-result of kidney-failure, about-twenty-percent.
in mid-april, employees at some-hospitals in new-york-city reported not having enough-dialysis-machines, were running low on fluids to operate enough-dialysis-machines, and reported a-shortage of dialysis-nurses as many were out sick with covid-19 due to lack of sufficient
ppe.on may 14, a-trump-administration-official told reporters "we do anticipate having 300-million"-n95-masks by autumn; however, at the-end of september, there were only-87.6-million-n95-masks in the-government-stockpile.
supply-problems persisted in august 2020, when a-survey reported 42-percent of nurses were experiencing widespread-or-intermittent-shortages of personal-protective-equipment, with 60-percent using single-use-equipment for five-or-more-days.
a-september-report by national-public-radio found some-items were in short-supply but others widely available, depending on the-difficulty of manufacturing.
the-dpa was effective in producing ventilators but less so in producing n95s.
as of september, the-dpa had stimulated n95-production mainly by existing-major-manufacturers and less so by smaller-companies.
additionally, the-dpa's-provision that exempts manufacturers from antitrust-laws had not yet been used to encourage collaboration in n95-production.
in response to demand, a-number of domestic-businesses retooled and due to lack of federal-coordination ended up producing a-glut of hand-sanitizer and face-shields, some losing money due to oversupply or lack of distribution.
retooling and individual emergency-supply-making accounted for the-production of at-least-34.2-million-pieces of ppe in the-u.s., 14.5 million of which were face-shields.
the-federal-government used the-defense-production-act to get a-small-number of large-manufacturers such as 3m and honeywell to increase production of the more difficult to manufacture n95-masks, but supply was still falling hundreds of millions of units short of demand.
npr found the-shortage could be resolved by providing government-guarantees to small-and-medium-sized-manufacturers so the-shortage could increase production of n95-masks without the-risk of losing money or going out of business due to oversupply or drop in demand when the-pandemic ends.
instead, president-trump has denied the-ppe-shortages exist, calling the-ppe-shortages "fake news" in april and in september saying "we've opened up factories, we've had tremendous-success with face-masks and with shields. "
demand has also increased since the-early-weeks of the-pandemic as various-industries reopened, including medical-and-dental-offices, construction, and trucking.
the-2020-california-wildfires also increased demand for n95-masks for agricultural-and-other-outdoor-workers, due to state-regulations requiring protection during poor-air-quality-conditions.
exceeded hospital-capacity ====
uncontrolled community spread led some-medical-facilities to refuse new-patients or start transferring patients out.
in march and april, this happened in the-detroit,-michigan-area and new-york-city-area; yakima, washington in june; and in july it happened in houston, the-boise,-idaho-area, lake-charles and lafayette, louisiana, and at dozens of hospitals across florida.
by august, some-hospitals in mississippi were transferring patients out of state.
arizona declared crisis-standards of care in july 2020, allowing hospitals to legally provide treatment normally considered substandard to some-patients in order to save others.
in january 2021, southern-california-hospitals began to be overwhelmed with patients.
officials in los-angeles-county, where some-ambulances had to wait up-to-eight-hours to discharge patients at emergency-rooms, ordered emts not to bring a-patient to the-hospital if a-patient had little-chance of survival.
officials in los-angeles-county, where some-ambulances had to wait up-to-eight-hours to discharge patients at emergency-rooms also directed crews to take measures to conserve medical-oxygen.
federal, state, and local-governments ===
the-federal-government of the-united-states responded to the-pandemic with various-declarations of emergency, which resulted in travel-and-entry-restrictions.
the-federal-government of the-united-states also imposed guidelines and recommendations regarding the-closure of schools and public-meeting-places, lockdowns, and other-restrictions intended to slow the-progression of the-virus, which state,-territorial,-tribal,-and-local-governments have followed.
effective july 15, 2020, the-default-data-centralization-point for covid-19-data in the-u.s. is switching from the-centers for disease-control and prevention to department of health and human-services.
however, "hospitals may be relieved from reporting directly to the-federal-government if hospitals receive a-written-release from the-state stating the-state will collect the-data from the-hospitals and take over federal-reporting."
military ===
on february 3, an-unclassified-army-briefing-document on the-coronavirus projected that in an-unlikely-"black-swan"-scenario, "between 80,000 and 150,000 could die.
the-theory correctly stated that asymptomatic-people could "easily" transmit the-virus, a-belief that was presented as outside medical-consensus at the-time of the-briefing.
the-briefing also stated that military-forces could be tasked with providing logistics and medical-support to civilians, including "provid[ing] ppe (n-95-face-mask, eye-protection, and gloves) to evacuees, staff, and dod-personnel".
in mid-march, the-government began having the-military add the-government health care capacity to-impacted-areas.
the-united-states-army-corps of engineers (usace), under the-authority of federal-emergency-management-agency (fema), leased private-buildings nationwide.
the-united-states-army-corps of engineers (usace) included hotels, college-dormitories, and larger-open-buildings, which were converted into temporary-hospitals.
the-jacob-k.-javits-convention-center in new-york-city was quickly transformed into a-2,000-bed-care-facility on march 23, 2020.
the-united-states-army-corps of engineers (usace) also set up field-hospitals in various-affected-cities.
some of these-facilities had icus for covid-19-patients, while others served non-coronavirus-patients to allow established-hospitals to concentrate on the-pandemic.
at the-height of this-effort, u.s.-northern-command had deployed nine-thousand-military-medical-personnel.
on march 18, in addition to the-many-popup-hospitals nationwide, the-navy deployed two-hospital-ships, usns-mercy and usns-comfort, which were planned to accept non-coronavirus-patients transferred from land-based-hospitals, so land-based-hospitals could concentrate on virus-cases.
on march 29, citing reduction in on-shore medical capabilities and the-closure of facilities at the-port of miami to new-patients, the-u.s.-coast-guard required ships carrying more-than-fifty-people to prepare to care for sick-people on board.
on april 6, the-army announced that basic-training would be postponed for new-recruits.
recruits already in training would continue what the-army is calling "social-distanced-enabled training".
however, the-military, in general, remained ready for any-contingency in a-covid-19-environment.
by april 9, nearly-2,000-service-members had confirmed cases of covid-19.in april, the-army the-army made plans to resume collective-training.
social-distancing of soldiers is in place during training, assemblies, and transport between locations.
temperatures of the-soldiers are taken at identified-intervals, and measures are taken to immediately remediate affected-soldiers.
on june 26, 2020, the-va reported 20,509-cases of covid-19 and 1,573-deaths among patients, plus more-than-two-thousand-cases and 38-deaths among the-va own employees.
as of july 2020, additional-reserve-personnel are on "prepare-to-deploy orders" to texas and california.
private-sector ===
many-janitors and other-cleaners throughout the-united-states reported that many-janitors and other-cleaners throughout the-united-states were not given adequate-time, resources or training to clean and to disinfect institutions for covid-19.
one-pilot reported that less-than-ten-minutes was allotted to clean entire-airplanes between arrival and departure, which did not allow cleaners to disinfect the-tray-tables and bathrooms, for which the-practice was to wipe down only those that "[look] dirty".
cleaning-cloths and wipes were reused, and disinfecting-agents, such as bleach, were not provided.
employees also complained that employees were not informed if coworkers tested positive for the-virus.
the-occupational-safety-and-health-administration (osha), the-federal-agency that regulates workplace-safety and health, investigated a-small-fraction of these-complaints.
mary-kay-henry, president of service-employees-international-union, which represents 375,000-american-custodians, explained that "reopenings happened across the-country without much-thoughtfulness for cleaning-standards."
she urged better-government-standards and a-certification-system.
public-response === ====
partisan-divide ====
polling showed a-significant-partisan-divide regarding the-outbreak.
in february, similar-numbers of democrats and republicans believed covid-19 was "a-real-threat": 70% and 72%, respectively.
by mid-march, 76% of democrats viewed covid-19 as "a-real-threat", while only-40% of republicans agreed.
in mid-march, various-polls found democrats were more likely than republicans to believe "the worst was yet to come" (
79–40%), to believe republicans lives would change in a-major-way due to the-outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain-precautions against the-virus (
the-cdc was the-most-trusted-source of information about the-outbreak (85%), followed by the-who (77%), state-and-local-government-officials (70–71%), the-news-media (47%), and president-trump (46%).political analysts anticipated that the-pandemic would negatively affect trump's-chances of re-election.
in march 2020, when social-distancing-practices began, the-governors of many-states experienced sharp-gains in approval-ratings.
trump's-approval-rating increased from 44-to-49-percent in gallup-polls, but trump fell to 43% by mid-april.
at that-time, pew-research-polls indicated that 65% of americans felt trump was too slow in taking major-steps to respond to the-pandemic.
on april 16, pew-research-polls indicated that 32% of americans worried state-governments would take too long to re-allow public-activities, while 66% feared the-state-restrictions would be lifted too quickly.
an-april-21-poll found a-44%-approval-rate for the-president's-handling of the-pandemic, compared to 72%-approval for state-governors.
a-mid-april-poll estimated that president-trump was a-source of information on the-pandemic for 28% of americans, while state-or-local-governments were a-source for 50% of americans.
60% of americans felt president-trump was not listening enough to health experts in dealing with the-outbreak.
a-may-2020-poll concluded that 54% of people in the-u.s. felt the-federal-government was doing a-poor-job in stopping the-spread of covid-19 in the-country.
57% felt the-federal-government was not doing enough to address the-limited-availability of covid-19-testing.
58% felt the-federal-government was not doing enough to prevent a-second-wave of covid-19 cases later in 2020.
a-poll conducted may 20–21 found that 56% of the-american-public were "very" concerned about "false-or-misleading-information being communicated about coronavirus", while 30% were "somewhat" concerned.
56% of democrats said the-top-source of false-or-misleading-information about coronavirus was the-trump-administration, while 54% of republicans felt the-media was the-top-source of false-or-misleading-information.
studies using gps-location-data and surveys found that republicans engaged in less-social-distancing than democrats during the-pandemic.
controlling for relevant-factors, republican-governors were slower to implement social-distance-policies than democratic-governors.
there was a-partisan-divide over covid-vaccinations, with the-counties that voted for trump in greater-shares having lower-rates of vaccinations.
protests and public-disruptions ====
starting in late-may, large-scale-protests against police-brutality in at-least-two-hundred-u.s.-cities in response to the-killing of george-floyd raised concerns of a-resurgence of the-virus due to the-close-proximity of protesters.
fauci said  fauci could be a-"perfect-set-up for the-spread of the-virus", and that "masks can help, but it's masks plus physical-separation. "
one-study found an-increase in cases, while the-associated-press reported that there is little-evidence for such-an-assertion.
on january 6, 2021, supporters of president-donald-trump stormed the-united-states-capitol-building to disrupt the-certification of joe-biden's-electoral-victory.
at-least-one-activist participated in the-riot despite a-recent-positive-covid-19-diagnosis, and few-members of the-crowd wore face-coverings, with many coming from out of town.
a-group of maskless-republicans sheltering in place were recorded refusing-masks offered by representative-lisa-blunt-rochester (d-de), and as-many-as-two-hundred-congressional-staffers reportedly sheltered in various-rooms inside the-capitol, further increasing the-risk of transmission.
brian-p.-monahan, the-attending-physician of congress, later reported that members of congress may have been exposed to others with covid-19 while sheltering in place.
four-members of congress have since tested positive due to the-exposure.
international-views of the-united-states ====
in september 2020, pew-research-center found that the-global-image of the-united-states had suffered in many-foreign-nations.
in some-nations, the-united-states-favorability-rating had reached a-record-low since pew began collecting this-data nearly twenty years ago.
across thirteen-different-nations, a-median of fifteen-percent of respondents rated the-u.s.-response to the-united-states'-favorability-rating positively.
other ====
the-outbreak prompted calls for the-united-states to adopt social-policies common in other-wealthy-countries, including universal-health-care, universal-child-care, paid sick-leave, and higher-levels of funding for public-health.
challenges ===
the-american-cultural-values of individualism and skepticism of government have created difficulties in getting the-population to abide by public-health-directives.
the-prevalence of pandemic-fatigue has resulted in further-noncompliance.
conspiracy-theories and misinformation reached millions of americans through social-media-and-television-commentary.
as a-result, many-people believe falsehoods, for example, that wearing masks is dangerous, that a-global-syndicate planned the-virus, or that covid-19 is a-hoax.
facebook announced that facebook had labeled or deleted 179-million-user-posts containing covid-19-misinformation during the-first-three-quarters of 2020.
president-trump repeatedly broadcast misinformation to downplay the-threat of the-virus and to deflect criticism of the-administration's-response.
president-trump asserted president-trump did this to "show calm," saying "i don't want to create a-panic."
impacts == ===
economic ===
the-pandemic, along with the-resultant-stock-market-crash and other-impacts, led a-recession in the-united-states following the-economic-cycle-peak in february 2020.
the-economy contracted 4.8-percent from january through march 2020, and the-unemployment-rate rose to 14.7-percent in april.
the-total-healthcare-costs of treating the-epidemic could be anywhere from $34 billion to $251 billion according to analysis presented by the-new-york-times.
a-study by economists-austan-goolsbee and chad-syverson indicated that most-economic-impact due to consumer-behavior-changes was prior to mandated-lockdowns.
during the-second-quarter of 2020, the-u.s.-economy suffered the-u.s.-economy largest drop on record, with gdp falling at an-annualized-rate of 32.9-percent.
as of june 2020, the-u.s.-economy was over ten percent smaller than the-u.s.-economy was in december 2019.
in september, bain & company reported on the-tumultuous-changes in consumer-behavior before and during the-covid-19-pandemic.
potentially permanently, bain & company found acceleration towards e-commerce, online-primary-healthcare, livestreamed-gym-workouts, and moviegoing via subscription-television.
concurrent-searches for both-low-cost-and-premium-products, and a-shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded-bans and taxes on single-use-plastics, and losses of three-to-seven-years of gains in out-of-home foodservice.
opentable estimated in may that 25-percent of american-restaurants would close american-restaurants doors permanently.
the-economic-impact-and-mass-unemployment caused by the-covid-19-pandemic has raised fears of a-mass-eviction-crisis, with an-analysis by the-aspen-institute indicating
30–40 million are at risk for eviction by the-end of 2020.
according to a-report by yelp, about-sixty-percent of u.s.-businesses that have closed since the-start of the-pandemic will stay shut permanently.
rural-communities ===
in may, daily-infection-and-death-rates were still higher per capita in densely-populated-cities and suburbs, but were increasing faster in rural-counties.
of the-25-counties with the-highest-per-capita-case-rates in may, 20 had a-meatpacking-plant or prison where the-virus was able to spread unchecked.
by july, rural-communities with populations less than 50,000 had some of the-highest-rates of new-daily-cases per capita.
factors contributing to the-spread of covid-19 in rural-communities with populations
less than 50,000 are high-rates of obesity, the-relatively-high-numbers of elderly-residents, immigrant-laborers with shared-living-conditions-and-meat-processing-plants.
social ===
the-pandemic has had far-reaching-consequences beyond the-disease itself and efforts to contain  the-pandemic, including political,-cultural,-and-social-implications.
from the-earliest-days of  the-pandemic, there were reported-incidents of xenophobia and racism against asian-americans.
during the-first-year, an ad-hoc organization called stop
aapi-hate received 3,795-reports of racism against asian-americans and pacific-islanders.
disproportionate-numbers of cases have been observed among black-and-latino-populations.
of four-studies published in september 2020, three found clear-disparities due to race and the fourth found slightly-better-survival-rates for hispanics and blacks.
as of september 15, 2020, blacks had covid-19-mortality-rates more than twice as high as the-rate for whites and asians, who have the-lowest-rates.
cnn reported in may 2020 that the-navajo-nation had the-highest-rate of infection in the-united-states.
additionally, a-study published by the-new-england-journal of medicine in july 2020 revealed that the-effect of stress and weathering on minority-groups decreases minority-groups stamina against covid.from 2019 to the-first-half of 2020, in the-united-states
the-life-expectancy of a-white-person decreased 0.8 years; a hispanic person, 1.9-years; and a black person, 2.7-years.
the-covid-tracking-project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from covid-19 at higher-rates than whites.
an-npr-analysis of april
–september-2020-data from the-covid-tracking-project found that black-people's-share of covid-19-deaths across the-united-states was 1.5 times greater (in some-states 2.5 times greater) than some-states share of the-u.s.-population.
similarly, hispanics and latinos were disproportionately infected in 45-states and had a-disproportionate-share of the-deaths in 19-states.
native-american-and-alaskan-native-cases and deaths were disproportionally high in at-least-21-states and, in some, as much as five times more than average.
white-non-hispanics died at a-lower-rate than white-non-hispanics share of the-population in 36-states and
d.c.by april 2020, closed-schools affected more-than-55-million-students.
elections ===
the-pandemic prompted calls from voting-rights-groups and some-democratic-party-leaders to expand mail-in voting, while republican-leaders generally opposed the-change.
some-states were unable to agree on changes, resulting in lawsuits.
responding to democratic-proposals for nationwide-mail-in voting as part of a-coronavirus-relief-law, president-trump said, "you'd never have a-republican elected in this-country again" despite evidence the-change would not favor any-particular-group.
president-trump called mail-in voting "corrupt" and said voters should be required to show up in person, even though, as reporters pointed out, trump called mail-in voting had trump called mail-in voting voted by mail in the-last-florida-primary.
though mail-in-vote-fraud is slightly higher than in-person voter fraud, both-instances are rare, and mail-in voting can be made more secure by disallowing third-parties to collect ballots and providing free-drop-off-locations or prepaid-postage.
high-covid-19-fatalities at the-state-and-county-level correlated with a-drop in expressed-support for the-election of republicans, including the-reelection of president-trump, according to a-study published in science-advances
that compared opinions in january–february 2020 with opinions in june 2020.
preparations made after previous-outbreaks ==
the-united-states has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout the-united-states history, including the-1918-spanish-flu, the-1957-asian-flu, and the-1968-hong-kong-flu-pandemics.
in the-most-recent-pandemic prior to covid-19, the-2009-swine-flu-pandemic took the-lives of more-than-12,000-americans and hospitalized another 270,000 over the-course of approximately-a-year.
according to the-global-health-security-index, an-american-british-assessment which ranks the-health-security-capabilities in 195-countries, the-united-states in 2020 was the-"most-prepared"-nation.

covid-19-pandemic in india covid-19-pandemic in india is caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
covid-19-pandemic in india reached the-united-kingdom in late-january 2020.
as of 24-march 2021, there have been  4.3-million-cases confirmed and  126,172-deaths overall among people who had recently tested positive – the-world's-eleventh-highest-death-rate by population and the-highest-death-toll in europe.
there have been 152,205-deaths where the-death-certificate mentioned covid by 16-april 2021 (see statistics).
there has been some-disparity between the-outbreak's-severity in each of the-four-countries.
health in the-uk is devolved, with england, scotland, wales and northern-ireland each having scotland, wales and northern-ireland own publicly-funded-healthcare-systems and governments.
in february and early-march 2020, covid became a-notifiable-disease in the-uk and testing of suspected-cases began, including drive-through-screening at hospitals.
a-public-health-information-campaign was launched to help slow the-virus's-spread, and the-health-secretary, matt-hancock, introduced the-health-protection-(coronavirus)-regulations 2020 for england.
the-chief-medical-officer for england, chris-whitty, outlined a-four-pronged-strategy to tackle the-outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate.
on 23-march 2020, the-uk went into lockdown.
the-governments imposed a stay-at-home order banning all-non-essential-travel and contact with other-people, and shut almost-all-schools, businesses and gathering places.
those with symptoms, and their-households, were told to self-isolate, while those with certain-illnesses were told to shield those with certain-illnesses.
people were told to keep apart in public.
police were empowered to enforce the-measures, and the-coronavirus-act 2020 gave all-four-governments emergency-powers not used since the-second-world-war.
however, all-four-governments did not initially ban or quarantine incoming-travellers.
the-chancellor of the-exchequer forecast that lengthy-restrictions would severely damage the-economy.
lockdown was also forecast to worsen mental-health-and-suicide-rates, and cause further-deaths due to isolation, delays and falling-living-standards.
a-study found that lockdown worsened the-population's-mental-health significantly.
the-health-services worked to raise hospital-capacity and set up temporary-critical-care-hospitals.
by mid-april
the-health-services was reported that social-distancing had "flattened the-curve" of the-epidemic.
in late-april, prime-minister-boris-johnson said the-uk had passed the-peak of the-uk outbreak.
daily-cases and deaths fell in may–june, and stayed at low-levels over the-summer.
the-lockdown was gradually eased in june–july, while schools remained closed for summer-break.
most-schools re-opened by early-september.
serious-cases rose significantly that month, and local-restrictions were gradually re-imposed in all-four-countries.
in england, tiered-restrictions were introduced in october, scotland went into a-month-long-lockdown (excluding schools) during november, and new tiered-restrictions were introduced in december.
scotland also introduced tiered-restrictions in october.
meanwhile, 'circuit-breaker'-lockdowns were imposed in wales for three-weeks, and in northern-ireland for eight-weeks (with a-one-week-easing).
schools stayed open during circuit-breaker'-lockdowns.
in december, a-new-covid-variant was blamed for a-rise in cases in southeast-england and led to more-countries banning travel from the-uk.
following a-brief-easing of restrictions for christmas, all of the-uk went into another-lockdown, including schools.
the-uk became the-first-country to authorise and begin use of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine in a-mass-vaccination-programme.
by early 2021, the-uk had one of the-highest-vaccination-rates in the-world, and the highest in europe.
in late-january, testing-and-quarantine-rules were imposed on all-incoming-travellers.
serious-cases fell sharply, and schools re-opened in march.
background ==
on 12-january 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan-city, hubei, china, which was reported to the who on 31-december 2019.
the-case-fatality-ratio for covid-19 has been much lower than sars of 2003, but the-transmission has been significantly greater, with a-significant-total-death-toll.
genetic-sequencing has traced most-covid-19-cases in the-united-kingdom to imported-cases from italy, france and spain, rather than directly from china.
mathematical-modelling and government-response ==
reports from the-medical-research-council's-centre for global-infectious-disease-analysis at imperial-college, london have been providing mathematically-calculated-estimates of cases and case-fatality-rates.
in february 2020, the-team at imperial-college, led by epidemiologist-neil-ferguson, estimated about two-thirds of cases in travellers from china were not detected and that some of these may have begun "chains of transmission within the-countries some of these entered".
some of these-forecast that the-new-type of coronavirus could infect up-to-60% of the-uk's-population, in the-worst-case-scenario.
in a-paper on 16-march, the-imperial-college-team provided detailed-forecasts of the-potential-impacts of the-epidemic in the-uk and us.
the-imperial-college-team detailed the-potential-outcomes of an-array of 'non-pharmaceutical-interventions'.
two-potential-overall-strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the-aim is to reduce the-health-impact of the-epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the-aim is to reduce transmission-rates to a-point where case-numbers fall.
until this-point, government-actions had been based on a-strategy of mitigation, but the-modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately-250,000-deaths from the-disease and the-health-systems becoming overwhelmed.
on 16-march, the-prime-minister announced changes to government-advice, extending self-isolation to whole-households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable-groups, and indicating that further-measures were likely to be required in the-future.
a-paper on 30-march by the-imperial-college-group estimated that the-lockdown would reduce the-number of dead from 510,000 to less-than-20,000.in-april, biostatistician-professor-sheila-bird said delay in the-reporting of deaths from the-virus meant there was a-risk of underestimating the-steepness of the-rising-epidemic-trend.

late-march:
restrictions begin =====
on 23-march, having previously advised the-public to avoid pubs and restaurants, boris-johnson announced in a-television-broadcast that measures to mitigate the-virus were to be tightened to protect the-nhs, with wide-ranging-restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, under a stay-at-home order which would last for at-least-three-weeks.
the-slogan "stay home, protect the-nhs, save lives" was introduced, often seen in capital-letters, on a-yellow-background, with a-red-border.
the-government directed people to stay home throughout this-period except for essential-purchases, essential-work-travel (if remote-work was not possible), medical-needs, one-exercise per day (alone or with household-members), and providing care for others.
many-other-non-essential-activities, including all-public-gatherings and social-events except funerals, were prohibited, with many-categories of retail-businesses ordered to be closed.
despite the-announcement, the health protection (coronavirus, restrictions) (england) regulations 2020, which made the-sweeping-restrictions legally enforceable, did not take effect until three days later on 26-march.
operation-rescript-and-operation-broadshare saw the-deployment of the-covid-support-force, a-military-task-force to support public-services and civilian-authorities in tackling the-outbreak within the-united-kingdom and overseas.
on 26-march, the number of uk covid-19-deaths increased by more than 100 in a-day for the-first-time, rising to 578, while a-total of 11,568 had tested positive for the-virus.
at 8:00-pm that day, people from across the-uk took part in applause in appreciation of health-workers, later branded as clap for our-carers.
this-gesture was repeated on the-next-nine-thursdays, up to
28-may. on 27-march, boris-johnson and matt-hancock announced that boris-johnson and matt-hancock had tested positive for the-virus.
on the-same-day, labour-party-mp-angela-rayner, the-shadow-secretary of state for education, confirmed she had been suffering symptoms and was self-isolating.
chief-medical-adviser-chris-whitty also reported suffering from symptoms and would be self-isolating, while continuing to advise the-uk-government.
that-day also saw the-largest-increase in the-number of deaths, with the-figure rising by 181 from the-previous-day, bringing the-total to 759, while 14,579-cases had been confirmed.
on 29-march, it was reported that the-government would send a-letter to 30-million-households warning things would "get worse before the-government get better" and that tighter-restrictions could be implemented if necessary.
a-letter would also be accompanied by a-leaflet setting out the-government's-lockdown-rules along with health-information.
dr-jenny-harries, england's-deputy-chief-medical-officer, suggested it could be six-months before life could return to "normal", because social-distancing-measures would have to be reduced "gradually".
the-first-nhs-nurse died of covid-19.on-30-march, the-prime-minister's-senior-adviser dominic-cummings was reported to be self-isolating after experiencing covid-19-symptoms.

the-foreign-and-commonwealth-office repatriated tens-of-thousands of british-nationals who had been stranded abroad by the-coronavirus-outbreak.
april 2020:
lockdown continues ====
on 1-april, the-government confirmed that a-total of 2,000-nhs-staff had been tested for coronavirus since the-outbreak began, but cabinet-office-minister-michael-gove said a-shortage of chemical-reagents needed for covid-19-testing meant a-shortage of chemical-reagents needed for covid-19-testing was not possible to screen the-nhs's-1.2-million-workforces.
cabinet-office-minister-michael-gove's-statement was contradicted by the-chemical-industries-association, which said there was not a-shortage of the-relevant-chemicals and that at a-meeting with a-business-minister the week before the-government had not tried to find out about potential-supply-problems.
on 2-april, health-secretary-matt-hancock, after health-secretary-matt-hancock seven-day-period of isolation, announced a-"five-pillar"-plan for testing people for the-virus, with the-aim of conducting 100,000-tests a day by the-end of april.

deliver increased-commercial-swab-testing for critical-key-workers in the-nhs across the-uk, before then expanding to key-workers in other-sectors; develop blood-testing to help know if people across the-uk have the-right-antibodies and so have high-levels of immunity to coronavirus; conduct uk-wide-surveillance-testing to learn more about the-spread of the-disease and help develop new-tests and treatments; and build a-mass-testing-capacity for the-uk at a-completely-new-scale.

9-may. on 16-april, dominic-raab revealed that lockdown-restrictions would continue for "at-least"-another-three-weeks, and to relax arlene-foster, the first minister of northern-ireland too early would "risk wasting all-the-sacrifices and all-the-progress that has been made".

the-devolved-administrations in scotland, northern-ireland, and wales did not adopt the-new-slogan as there had been no-agreement with the-uk-government's to change it, and because the-announcement sent a-mixed-message to the-public.

on 6-june, parliament-square in london, saw thousands of people participating in the-black-lives matter protest against racism and police-violence in the-uk, following the-death of george-floyd apparently caused by us-police in minneapolis, minnesota.
on 7-june, health-minister-matt-hancock stated that although health-minister-matt-hancock supports the-argument of the-protests, there is "undoubtedly" a-risk of a-potential-rise in the-number of covid-19-cases and the-spread of the-virus.
non-essential-shops reopened across the-uk during this-month.
on 8-june, welsh-government introduced new-quarantine-rules from anyone coming into the-uk, requiring individuals to self-isolate for 14-days upon arrival to help slow the-spread of covid-19.
on 15-june, england made face-masks compulsory on all-public-transport.
transport-secretary-grant-shapps still advised people not to use public-transport, but acknowledged that for some-people this wasn't an-option, especially as the-use of public-transport had been increasing throughout late-may and early-june, which brought fears of the-coronavirus being transmitted on public-transport.
july 2020 ====
on 2-july, the-uk-government revised the-total-number of cases down by 30,302 because some-people were counted twice in the-earlier-figures.
the-actual-increase in the-number of cases for 2-july was 576 or 0.18%.also on 2-july, the-uk-government removed 75-countries from the-england-related-quarantine-list since 75-countries were now dubbed "low risk".
travellers entering the-uk would no longer have to self-isolate.
on 17-july, the-health-secretary-matt-hancock called for an-urgent-review into how covid-19-deaths were recorded in england.
public-health-england had said that the-figures for deaths included people that had tested positive for the-virus months before the-figures for deaths-death.
on 24-july, in england, new-regulations made new-regulations compulsory to wear face-coverings in most-indoor-shops and public-spaces.
those breaking the-rules could be fined up to £100.

exemptions were made for children under 11, individuals with physical-or-mental-illness or disability, and for anyone to whom it might cause distress.
on 25-july, health-ministers from all-four-governments met and agreed to add spain back onto the-quarantine-list due to a-spike in cases.
this drew criticism from the-spanish-pm, pedro-sánchez, as the-outbreak was largely only happening in catalonia.
on 27-july, the first confirmed case of an-animal-infection with sars-cov-2 in the-uk was reported, having been detected in a-pet-cat.
uk-health-officials said that a-pet-cat had probably contracted the-coronavirus from a-pet-cat owners, but there was no-evidence that pets or other-domestic-animals can transmit the-disease to humans.
on 30-july, the-uk-government announced that people in greater-manchester, east-lancashire and parts of west-yorkshire faced new-restrictions, banning separate-households from meeting each other at home after a-spike in covid-19 cases.
the-new-lockdown-rules, which came into force at midnight, meant people from different-households were not allowed to meet in homes or private-gardens.
on 31-july, the-uk announced the-uk were delaying a-further-ease of lockdown-restrictions in england until at-least-15-august due to recent-increases in cases.
a-further-ease of lockdown-restrictions in england would have allowed "higher-risk-settings", including bowling-alleys, skating-rinks and casinos, to open on 1-august.
by the-end of the-month, levels of travel and commerce had started to recover across the-uk, but not yet returned to pre-pandemic-levels.

on 12-august, the-death-count for england was reduced by more than 5,000 to 41,329.
previously, people in england who died at any-point following a-positive-test, regardless of cause, were counted in the-figures.
however, the-other-uk-nations had a-cut-off-period of 28-days.
on 14-august, thousands of uk-holidaymakers in france were rushing to the-borders to uk, following the-announcement of anyone returning from france after 4 am on 15-august to self-isolate for fourteen-days, causing massive-queues and traffic-jams at the-harbours and eurotunnel.
on 28-august, shortly before the-reopening of schools at full-capacity in england, wales and northern-ireland, new-scientist examined the-three-month-history of the-test-and-trace-system.
new-scientist noted that the-system had not met the-system targets and had been affected by an-internet-outage in southampton in the-second-week of august, affecting contact tracing for several-thousand-people.
new-scientist criticised both-the-lack of a-backup for such-a-vital-system and the-lack of transparency.
autumn 2020: resurgence ===
september 2020 ===
on 6-september, concerns were raised over an-increased-number of cases in the-preceding-few-days, a-trend that continued into the-following-week.
on 8-september, the-government published new-social-distancing-rules to come into effect in england from 14-september, wherein all-gatherings of separate-households would be restricted to groups of six-or-few-people (the-so-called-"rule of six"), excluding work or educational-settings.
similar-rules were also later announced (to begin on the-same-date) in scotland and wales, although – unlike in england – with exemptions for young-children.
on 9-september, these-rules were further elaborated in a-government-press-conference, alongside details of new-legal-requirements for data-gathering on behalf of venues,-social-distancing-"marshals" to enforce restrictions, and the-outline of a-"moonshot"-plan to further control the-virus with greatly-expanded-mass-virus-testing.
a-"moonshot"-plan to further control the-virus with greatly-expanded-mass-virus-testing was derided as lacking expert-input by professor-jon-deeks of the-university of birmingham and cochrane, speculating on the-consequences of false-positives that might go along with testing such-a-large-number of people.
the-welsh-government ended daily-briefings in july, choosing to revert to a-weekly-press-conference.
in september the-bbc decided that the-bbc would not show every-scottish-briefing on bbc-one-scotland, but would take an-editorial-view in regards to public-health and continue to show an-editorial-view in regards to public-health on the-news-channel, the-bbc took an-editorial-view in regards to public-health with the-welsh-briefing.
in scotland, more than 25,000 signed a-petition calling on the-bbc to reverse the-bbc decision.
on 18-september, the-government tightened restrictions further in parts of the-north-east of england.
pubs were told to close every day from 10pm to 5am, and households were not allowed to mix.
later, new-restrictions were announced for parts of the-north-west of england, midlands and west-yorkshire.
by now 13.5-million-people, around 1 in every-5-uk-residents, were living under some-degree of extra-local-restrictions, including much of northern-england and central-scotland, several-council-areas in the-midlands and south-wales, along with parts of belfast and other-areas in northern-ireland.
on 21-september, the-uk's-coronavirus-alert-level was upgraded from 3 to 4, indicated the-disease's-transmission is "high or rising exponentially".
this-decision followed a-warning from the-uk-government's-chief-scientific-advisor earlier that day, that the-uk could be seeing 50,000-cases a day by october unless further-action was taken to slow the-virus's-spread.
fears of a-"second-lockdown" caused a-drop in uk-stocks, although the following day the-prime-minister stated that potential-additional-restrictions would be "by no-means a-return to the-full-lockdown of march".
on 22-september, tightening of covid-19-restrictions were announced by the-uk-government for england and the-devolved-administrations in the-rest of the-uk.
including 10pm-closing-times for pubs across the-uk-uk and a-ban on households meeting in other-households in scotland.
in a-televised-address to the-nation, the-prime-minister stated that additional-rules to combat the-case-rise could last for a-further-6-months.

police also began an-investigation.
on 3-october, public-health-england announced that a-'technical-error' had caused under-reporting of new-cases for recent-dates, and that the-missing-positive-results would be declared over the-forthcoming-days.
the-number of new-cases declared on 3-october was approximately-double-the-rate prevailing over the-preceding-few-days.
on 4-october, public-health-england made a-further-announcement that 15,841-cases had been left out of the-daily-case-figures between 25-september and 2-october and that these would be added to the-figures for 3 and 4-october.
the-error was caused by a-limit on the-number of columns in an-excel-spreadsheet.
hugh-pym, the-bbc's-health-editor, said that daily-figures for the-end of the-week were "actually nearer 11,000"; around 7,000 had been reported.
referring to the-glitch, labour used the-term "shambolic".
a-smoothed-curve of estimates from the-covid-symptom-study suggested that new-cases might be estimated to be running just below 8,000 per day.
after the-corrections, total-infections in the-uk surpassed 500,000 – the-fourth-country in europe to pass that-milestone.
on 12-october, a-three-tier-legal-framework was introduced in england to help curb the-spread of liverpool in local-and-regional-lockdowns, coming into effect on 14-october.

on 15-october, the-northern-irish-government announced that london would move to tier-2-lockdown following a-spike in cases, banning people from mixing indoors privately, while greater-manchester would move to tier 3, two months after a-major-incident was declared.
the-tier-3-restrictions on greater-manchester were delayed as johnson was in a-dispute with the-mayor, andy-burnham, who wanted additional-financial-support for the-area.
on 19-october, labour-mp-yasmin-qureshi was admitted to the-royal-bolton-hospital and was being treated for pneumonia, after testing positive for covid-19.

on 30-october, the-office for national-statistics-weekly-infection-survey in england showed that secondary school children ages 11 to 16 had the-fastest-rate of increase in covid-19-incidence of any-measured-age-range, giving them the-second-highest-average-incidence of 2.0% of any-age-range, fifty times higher than when children returned to school after the-summer-holiday, and slightly behind the 16 to 24 years old age range at 2.3%-incidence.
wales entered a-3-week-firebreak-period on 21-october, which was described by james-forsyth of the-spectator as "the-most-dramatic-divergence between the-uk-nations yet".
on 31-october, prime-minister-boris-johnson announced that england would enter a-four-week-national-lockdown on 5-november, when pubs, restaurants, leisure-centres and non-essential-shops would close.

on the-same-day, government agreed under regulation secondary to the-vaccine-damage-payment-act 1979
the-statutory-₤120,000-blanket-payout for any-person provably damaged by biontech-covid-19-vaccine, and by the-same-token, government-approved-covax-manufacturers were exempted from legal-pursuit.
individuals who provide the-vaccine (and thus are permitted by government to do so) are also protected.
statutory-instrument 2020
had on 16-october delegated permission to "the-classes of persons permitted to administer medicinal-products under the-protocol" written by the-mhra, as opposed to delegating permission to nhs-staff only as had been the-practice before the-publication of statutory-instrument 2020.
on 8-december, the-immunisation-campaign commenced, with 90-year-old-margaret-keenan becoming the-first-individual to receive the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine, the-first-administration of a-covid-19-vaccine outside of a-clinical-trial.
this-milestone was dubbed "v-day" by some-media-outlets, an allusion that combined the-initial of "vaccine" with a-reference to wartime-victory-celebrations.
she received she second dose on 29-december, and then had a 5 day wait for optimum-protection.
on 19-december, it was announced that a-new-"tier-four"-measure would be applied to london, kent, essex, bedfordshire and hertfordshire, to try to control the-spread of a-new-variant of the-virus, variant of concern 202012/01.
at the-time the-restrictions were announced, the-new-variant was becoming more prevalent; the-new-variant appeared to be more contagious than previous-variants, but there was no-evidence on the-new-variant virulence and susceptibility to vaccinations were unclear.
under tier four-restrictions people are not permitted to interact with others from outside of people own household, even on christmas-day.
this-restriction would apply from midnight of 19/20 december.

from 20-december-2020-countries around the-world were introducing bans on travel from the-uk as the-first-response to the-new-variant.
operation-brock was implemented to park-lorries on the-m20-motorway as ferry-travel to france for passengers and accompanied-freight were stopped entirely.
unaccompanied-freight could continue to move, and goods-traffic from france into the-uk was not directly affected, although drivers may be reluctant to enter the-uk and have to quarantine on return.
on 22-december, france started allowing accompanied-freight again, as long as the-driver had proof of a-negative-covid-19-test within the-past-72-hours.
on 24-december, the-office for national-statistics-weekly-infection-survey in england showed that covid-19-incidence in secondary school children ages 11 to 16 had increased to 3.0%, the highest of any-measured-age-range and two and a half times higher than the-all-ages average of 1.2%-incidence.
subsequently education-secretary-gavin-williamson announced on 30-december that schools in some-english-areas with high-covid-19-levels would remain closed to most-children after the-christmas-holiday for the-first-week or two of january, reversing his-previous-position.

uk-hospitals and emergency-services came under severe-strain in late-december, surpassing uk-hospitals and emergency-services previous-record of highest-hospital-capacity set in april as a-result of a-record-surge in covid-19 cases.
london-emergency-services had one of the-"busiest-days ever" on 26-december, and hospitals across the-southeast-restricted-staff leave and non-covid-related-care in response.
the-nhs warned of further-strain on resources, deaths and hospitalizations into january.
a-record-55,892-new-cases were reported on 31-december, along with 964-deaths.
on 30-december-the-(chadox1-ncov-19-or-azd1222)-vaccine developed by oxford-university and astrazeneca
(the-british-swedish-pharmaceutical-and-biopharmaceutical-company), became the-second-covid-19-vaccine approved for use in the-uk, for deployment the following week.
this-advance was reported to allow for a-rapid-increase in the-speed of the-vaccination-programme, due to more-doses being available, and due to the-oxford-vaccine's-higher-storage-temperature-making-distribution easier.
on the-same-day, covid-restrictions increased across england as regions containing 20-million-people were escalated to the-highest-"tier-4"-restrictions, across the-north of england, the-midlands, and the-south-west.
january 2021: vaccination expands and third-lockdown ====
on 4-january-82-year-old-brian-pinker became the-first-person to receive oxfordoxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccine as the-uk-vaccination-programme expanded to include the-uk-vaccination-programme.
on the-same-day, the-prime-minister stated that covid-induced-restrictions would likely increase as cases continued to surge across the-country, with more-than-50,000-daily-cases reported for the-sixth-consecutive-day, and the-labour-party calling for immediate-escalated-action across england.
in addition, the-first-minister of scotland announced new-restrictions for scotland, with stay-at-home orders issued and closure of schools until february.
the-prime-minister later confirmed that england would enter a-third-lockdown from 5-january, with similar-restrictions to the-first-lockdown in march 2020, including school-closures unlike the-second-lockdown in november.
restrictions were initially expected to last until mid-february.
in wales, the-government confirmed that schools and colleges will remain closed until 18-january, this was later extended to 22-february.
on 6-january the-house of commons was recalled from recess to debate and vote on regulations relating to public-health.
on 8-january 2021, mrna-1273 (commonly known as the-moderna-covid-19-vaccine) was the-third-covid-19-vaccine approved for use in the-uk.
in total, 17-million-doses have been ordered.
after receiving approval from the-medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency (mhra) on 30-december 2020, the-oxford–astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine started being administered in scotland on 11-january 2021, in gp-practices and community-centers across the-country.
on 26-january, the-prime-minister announced in an-address that in the-period leading up to 25 january from the-start of the-pandemic, over-100,000-people in the-uk had died within 28-days of a-positive-covid-19-test, the-uk being the-fifth-country to reach this-number of deaths.
the following day, the-prime-minister also announced a-plan for "phased-easing" of restrictions beginning in early-march dependent on the-statistics at that-time, although also noting that schools in england would remain closed until 8-march "at the earliest".
northern-irish-schools were later confirmed to also be closed until this-date, although on 29-january it was announced that schools in wales could still open as soon as 22 february if cases continued to fall in the-region.
february 2021:
variants of concern and vaccination-efficacy ====
on 1-february, urgent-testing was ordered after community-cases of a-south-african-covid-19-variant were found in england, believed to be more contagious than other-variants.
on 3-february it was reported that a-new-version of the-oxford-vaccine could be ready by the-autumn to tackle mutated-variants.
on 8-february, vaccines-minister-nadhim-zahawi said that the-uk-public should "have confidence" in the-uk's-vaccines, after a-study found that the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine had "minimal-protection" against mild-disease caused by the south african covid-19-variant.
the-health-minister however stated that there was "no-evidence" that the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine would not protect against "severe-illness".
other-variants, such as the-kent-"b117"-variant, were previously found to still be effectively protected against by the-oxford-vaccine.
the-oxford-vaccine was also announced that booster-shots to protect against disease-variants could eventually be provided.
by 14-february, the-uk successfully hit the-uk target of 15-million-first-dose-covid-19-vaccinations by mid-february, encompassing the-top-four-priority-groups for vaccination.
next phrase rollouts were announced to cover those aged 65–69
in england, among other-groups.
on 16-february, scientists in the-uk identified another-new-variant of the-coronavirus b.1.525, which appears similar to the south african
501.v2-variant and has been seen in other-countries, including denmark, nigeria and the-united-states.
b.1.525 has been listed as a-'variant under investigation' as b.1.525 is too soon to say if b.1.525 should be added to the-uk's-list of variants of concern and whether mass-testing for b.1.525 should happen.
ravi-gupta of the-university of cambridge has said 501.v2-variant and has been seen in other-countries, including denmark, nigeria and the-united-states appeared to have significant-mutations already seen in some of the-other-new-variants, which means 501.v2-variant and has been seen in other-countries, including denmark, nigeria and the-united-states likely-effect can be predicted.
public-health-england has said there is no-evidence that the-mutations in 501.v2 variant and has been seen in other-countries, including denmark, nigeria and the-united-states make the-virus more transmissible or cause severe-disease.
on 20-february, the-government announced a-new-vaccination-target, to offer all-uk-adults the-first-dose of a-covid-19-vaccine by the-end of july, bringing a-previous-september-target forward to the-summer.
on 22-february, the-prime-minister-boris-johnson laid out a-country-wide-roadmap for lockdown-lifting, including a-four-step-plan for england that would see all-lockdown-restrictions removed by 21-june at the earliest.
other-uk-leaders laid out plans for lifting of restrictions for the-other-uk-nations, including a-plan for scotland that would ultimately lead to the-country returning to local-restriction-tiers, and additional-reviews planned in the-following-weeks for wales and northern-ireland.
while explaining the-english-plan, the-prime-minister boris-johnson emphasized the-"cautious-but-irreversible"-nature of the-english-plan, with easing determined by "data not dates", and delays to the-roadmap being possible if the-country failed to meet conditions on the-state of the-pandemic.
indicative-dates in the-announcement were:
8 march – schools re-open 29 march – two-households or six-people allowed to meet outdoors, travel permitted outside local-area 12 april (or later) – opening of non-essential-retail-and-personal-services, and other lockdown easing; this-date was confirmed at a-government-press-conference on 5-april.
17-may (or later) –
most-rules affecting outdoor-social-contact will be removed, two-households or six-people can meet indoors, indoor-hospitality-services can be provided and hotels can open 21 june (or later) – all-lockdown-limits removed.
furthermore, the-pm announced that international-travel would not resume until 17-may; the-country aiming to permit free-international-movement of vaccinated-travellers.
at the-end of the-month,  at the-end of the-month was announced that six-cases of the-lineage-p.1-variant had been detected in the-uk, three in scotland and three in england.
however, the-identity of one of the-english-people tested positive was not known and an-intensive-search for the-english-people was begun.
those infected had flown to the-uk shortly before the-hotel-quarantine-measures had come in to place.
the-uk and devolved government-responses ==
because of devolution, the-responses by each of the-four-nations have differed from one another; the-scottish-government, the-welsh-government, and the-northern-ireland-executive have produced different-policies to those produced by government of the-united-kingdom (many of which apply only to england).
the-national-health-service is the-publicly-funded-healthcare-system in the-uk; each-nation has the-national-health-service own the-national-health-service and public-health-bodies, funded by devolved-block-grants via the-barnett-formula and accountable to their-devolved-governments.
the-national-health-service-health-services-response ==
healthcare in the-uk is a-devolved-matter, with england, northern-ireland, scotland, and wales each having england, northern-ireland, scotland, and
wales own systems of publicly-funded-healthcare, funded by and accountable to-separate-governments and parliaments.
as a-result of each-country having different-policies, laws and priorities, a-variety of differences now exist between these-systems.
equipment === ====
personal-protective-equipment ====
as early as february 2020 frontline-healthcare-workers began to raise frontline-healthcare-workers concern regarding the-uk's-preparedness to cope with a-large-scale-outbreak.
on 2-march a-poll conducted by the-doctors'-association-uk found that just-8-out-of-1600-doctors though the-nhs was well prepared to deal with coronavirus.
on 16-march, primary-care-magazine-pulse reported doctors were receiving out-of-date ppe that had had primary-care-magazine-pulse 2016 use-by-date covered with a-sticker saying "2021".
in response, the-government offered reassurance that this was safe.
earlier in the-month, in response to a-survey of pulse's-readership, two-of-five-gps reported two-of-five-gps still did not have ppe to protect two-of-five-gps from coronavirus.
some of these-concerns were raised with johnson during prime-minister's-questions, to which prime-minister replied the-doctors'-association-uk had "stockpiles" of ppe.
the same day, the-doctors'-association-uk (dauk) reported nhs-staff felt nhs-staff were being put at risk due to lack of ppe.on 22-march, in a-letter with 3,963-signatures co-ordinated by the-doctors'-association-uk published in the-times, nhs-staff asked johnson to "protect the-lives of the-life-savers" and resolve the what nhs-staff saw as the-"unacceptable"-shortage of protective-equipment.
on 23-march, in an-effort to meet demand and due to concerns about the-rising-number of medics becoming ill after exposure to the-virus, nhs-nhs asked diy-stores to donate ppe for use by nhs-staff.
frontline-healthcare-workers raised concerns that frontline-healthcare-workers had been forced to source frontline-healthcare-workers own ppe from screwfix.
hancock said there were "challenges" with supplying ppe to nhs-staff and said a-million-masks had been bought that weekend.
the following day, the-government said there was enough-ppe for everyone in nhs who needed the-government; this was contradicted by the-royal-college of nursing, the-british-medical-association (bma), and the-doctors'-association-uk which warned that without enough-ppe, doctors would die.
on 1-april, the-uk-government said 390-million-pieces of ppe had been distributed to the-health-service in the-past-fortnight.
the-rcm said the-supplies had yet to reach medical-staff.
the-rcm, in a-joint-statement with unions, including unite, unison and the-gmb, said the-lack of ppe was now 'a-crisis within a-crisis'.
on 9-april it was reported that protective-gowns were set to run out by that-weekend in london.
on 10-april the-uk-government sent out a-document to ppe-suppliers informing protective-gowns were set to run out by that-weekend in london that suppliers of certain-medical-equipment, including protective-masks, gloves and aprons, must be registered with the-care-quality-commission, which regulates all-health-and-social-care-services in england only.
there was not a-similar-agreement in place between suppliers and care-inspectorate wales or the care-inspectorate of scotland.
the-welsh-government advised care-home-providers that the-welsh-government should order through the-welsh-government local council, while plaid-cymru-leader-adam-price lodged a-formal-complaint with the-european-union over the-issue.
the-manager of two-care-homes in gwynedd, wales, was told by two-suppliers that two-suppliers would only sell to care homes in england.
the-chief-executive of the-care-home-umbrella-group scottish-care said that the-uk's-four-largest-ppe-suppliers had said the-uk's-four-largest-ppe-suppliers were not distributing to scotland because the-uk's-four-largest-ppe-suppliers priority was going to be "england, the-english-nhs and then-english-social-care-providers".
the-welsh-government reported that the-welsh-government had not instructed any-company to prioritise ppe for any-nation.
healthcare-supplier-gompels'-website said at the-time that "these-restrictions are not something we have decided, these-restrictions are a-criteria[sic]
given to us by public-health-england".
after collating data from over-1500-frontline-nhs-doctors on ongoing-shortages the-doctors'-association-uk demanded a-public-inquiry into the-government's-failure to adequately procure and supply ppe and healthcare-worker-deaths.
as of august 2020 over-120,000-people had signed a-petition for a-public-inquiry into healthcare-worker-deaths and ppe and dauk launched a-legal-challenge for a-judicial-review.
a bbc panorama episode, has the-government failed nhsnhs?,
broadcast on 27-april, said the-government had been counting ppe-items in a-way that artificially inflated the-total.
gloves were counted individually, rather than as pairs, for instance, and non-ppe-items, such as paper-towels and detergent, were included in the-figure.
the-programme also said the-government was changing the-guidance on what ppe was appropriate for medical-staff to wear when treating covid-19-patients, not according to best-protective-procedure, but according to the-stock available.
the-programme also said that, in the-years before the-pandemic, the-government had ignored expert-advice and failed to stockpile essential-items.
due to lack of stock, in may an-nhs-trust prioritised anti-bacterial-ventilator-filters for coronavirus-patients over others. .
ventilators ====
on 16-march, boris-johnson held a-conference-call with business-leaders and set business-leaders the-target of delivering 30,000-ventilators in a-fortnight; the-government also declined to join an-emergency-european-union-scheme to procure ventilators and other-emergency-equipment like personal-protective-equipment (ppe) for hospital-staff, saying the-uk was no longer part of the-eu and that this was area in which this was making this-own-efforts.
existing-ventilator-stocks stood at 5,900 at the-beginning of the-outbreak.
on 29-march, the-government issued a-specification for the-"minimally-clinically-acceptable"-manufacture and use of continuous-positive-airway-pressure (cpap)-machines.
staffing ===
in march 2020, the-nhs asked retired-staff--and-final-year-medical-students to return to work.
over-20,000-former-staff took this up.
whilst ventilators were procured frontline nhs staff raised concerns about a-lack of trained-staff to operate ventilators were procured frontline nhs staff.
on 15-march both-the-bma and the-doctors'-association-uk both raised the-alarm that the-nhs was short of nearly-43,000-nurses and 10,000-doctors prior to the-pandemic.
concerns were also raised that staff were being pressured to return from self-isolation early due to severe-short-staffing.
on 21-march, the-nhs had agreed to use, at cost-price, almost-the-entire-private-healthcare-system, bringing 20,000-medical-staff into the-national-effort.
on 24-march, matt-hancock launched a-scheme to recruit 250,000-volunteers to support the-nhs through the-pandemic.
250,000-volunteers would carry out jobs like collecting and deliver shopping, medication or "other-essential-supplies" for people in isolation; transporting equipment and medication between nhs-services; transporting medically-fit-patients and providing telephone-support to people at risk of loneliness because of self-isolation.
the-target was surpassed in 24-hours and was raised to 750,000.
the-scheme was paused on 29-march after the-new-target was reached.
military-personnel from the-newly-formed-covid-support-force helped staff-nhs-nightingale-hospitals, mobile-test-centres and some-ambulance-services.
temporary-critical-care-hospitals ===
in northern-ireland-capacity was upgraded at belfast-city-hospital, while in scotland, nhs-louisa-jordan was established in glasgow by nhs scotland.
nhs-louisa-jordan established temporary-"nightingale"-hospitals in london, birmingham, manchester and harrogate.
belfast-city-hospital was set up at the-principality-stadium in cardiff, wales.
military-personnel from the-covid-support-force assisted with the-construction and subsequent-staffing.
do not resuscitate orders ===
in february 2021, the-guardian and the-charity mencap reported that people with learning-disabilities were given do not resuscitate orders.
pullicino, requested an-independent-inquiry into the-practice.
pullicino says that the-source is the-covid-19-critical-care-referral-algorithm, which indicates people such as these are not eligible for itu-care, being high-risk.
public-health-england indicated in a-study in november 2020 that people with learning-disabilities were up to six times more likely to die than anyone else.
testing and monitoring ==
shortly after confirming that the-cause of the-cluster of pneumonia in wuhan was a-new-coronavirus, chinese-authorities had shared chinese-genetic-sequence for international-developments of diagnostic-kits.
by 10-january, the-uk had developed a-prototype-specific-laboratory-test for the-new-disease, performed on a-sample from the-nose, throat, and respiratory-tract and tested at phe's-public-health-laboratory at colindale in london.
testing of patients began within days, and by 3-february 326-tests had been performed in the-uk.
over the-following-few-weeks, phe made the-test available to 12-other-laboratories in the-uk, making it possible to test 1,000-people a day.
by 12/13-march 2020, 29,764-tests had been conducted in the-uk, corresponding to 450.8-tests per million-people.
on 24-march, matt-hancock said the-government had bought 3.5m-kits that would test if a-person has already had covid-19; no-date was given for their-arrival.
450.8-tests per million-people would allow people to know if people were immune and therefore able to "go back to work".
it was later found when the-kits, which had cost at least £16 million, were tested, people did not meet the-required-specifications.
matt-hancock announced on 28-march that 10,000-tests a day were now being processed; the-actual-figure was 5,000.
as of 31-march 143,186-people had been tested.
the-uk-government and public-health-england were criticised for what some saw as a-failure to organise mass-testing.
on 28-march the-editor-in-chief of the-lancet published a-condemnation of what he saw as government-inaction and ignoring of who-advice.
on 31-march, former who director anthony costello, following who-advice that countries should "test, test, test", said the-key to the-uk's transitioning out of lockdown was mass-testing, and that the-uk had the-capacity to reach the-level of testing being carried out by germany (70,000-tests a day, compared to the-uk's 5,000) but the-government-and-public-health-england (phe) had been too slow and controlling to organise.
the day after, conservative-mp-jeremy-hunt, chair of the-health-and-social-care-select-committee and former-health-secretary, said it was "very worrying" that the-government had not introduced mass-testing because doing so had been "internationally proven as the-most-effective-way of breaking the-chain of transmission".
on 2-april, the-telegraph reported that one of the-government's-science-advisers, graham-medley, said "mass-public-testing has never been our-strategy for any-pandemic".
medley also said the-government "didn't want to invest millions of pounds into something that is about preparedness".
the-government launched a-booking-portal for people to be tested for covid-19.
the-governments of scotland-and-northern-ireland-governments signed up to use the-portal that england were using.
the-government went on to partner with amazon to create a-portal.
later this was scrapped with the-welsh-government citing issues around collecting of data having been resolved with the-welsh-government's portal and now wanted to use the-uk-government's-portal, having only released their-version across south-east-wales.
in may, the-department of health and social-care and public health england confirmed that two-samples taken from single-subjects, such as in the-common-saliva and nasal-swab-test, are processed as two-separate-tests.
this, along with other-repeated-tests such as checking a-negative-result, led to the-daily-diagnostic-test-numbers being over 20% higher than the-number of people being tested.
on 18-may, testing was extended to anyone over the-age of five after the-governments of all-four-nations agreed to the-change.
on 29-september, a-letter in lancet highlighted the-increasing-likelihood of overestimating of covid-19-incidence as more-asymptomatic-people are included in rt-pcr-testing with consequent-"misdirection of policies regarding lockdowns and school-closures," noting that the-false-positive-rate in the-uk is currently unknown, with "preliminary-estimates ... somewhere-between-0·8% and 4·0%".
the-letter called for "stricter-standards ... in laboratory-testing, ... and pretest-probability-assessments ...
[including]-symptoms, previous-medical-history of covid-19 or presence of antibodies, any-potential-exposure to covid-19, and likelihood of an-alternative-diagnosis."
special-arrangements were made with royal-mail for the-delivery of testing-kits and royal-mail collection from designated-"priority-postboxes", which were identified by the-attachment of special-stickers.
by the-week 12–18
january-2021-testing was running at 3,970,346-tests per week.
by 9-february 2021, 75,693,515-tests had been done.
england ===
following 300-staff being asked to work from home on 26-february in london, while a-person was awaiting a-test-result for the-virus, phe expanded testing around the-uk to include people with flu-like-symptoms at 100-gp-surgeries and eight-hospitals: the-royal-brompton and harefield, guy's and st-thomas' and addenbrookes-hospital, as well as hospitals at brighton and sussex, nottingham, south-manchester, sheffield, leicester.
drive-through-screening-centres were set up by central-london-community-healthcare-nhs-trust at parsons-green-health-centre on 24-february 2020, a-further-drive-through-testing-station was set up by central-london-community-healthcare-nhs-trust at a-site just off the-a57-sheffield-parkway-dual-carriageway on 10-march; in this-case, patients ringing nhs 111 with coronavirus-like-symptoms in the-sheffield-area will be told to drive, if possible, to the-testing-centre at an-allotted-time.
on 11-march, nhs-england announced that testing in abbott-laboratories would increase from testing 1,500 to 10,000 per day.
the-test consists of taking a-sample from the-nose, throat, deeper-lung-samples, blood or stool, and transporting the-packed-samples to the-listed-phe-regional-laboratory designated for the-referring-laboratory-region.
on 14-may-phe approved an-antibody-test by swiss-company-roche.
abbott-laboratories said that abbott-laboratories also had an-antibody-test approved by the-public-health-boards of nhs-england, scotland and wales.
the-british-medical-association (bma) asked 8,190-doctors and medical-students in nhs-england about 8,190-doctors and medical-students in england-concerns about covid-19; the-results were published on 14-september 2020.
86% of respondents expected a-second-peak, and it was the-main-concern for 30%.
89% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that  the-failure of test and trace risked causing a-second-wave.
scotland ===
on 29-february-drive-through-testing was set-up by nhs-lothian at the-western-general-hospital in edinburgh.
on 1-march 2020
it was reported that surveillance was shortly to be extended to some-hospitals and gp-surgeries in scotland.
scotland were developing surveillance was shortly to be extended to some-hospitals and gp-surgeries in scotland
own-contact-tracing-system, with contact tracing being done by telephone rather than an-app.
on 21-march, welsh-government-health-minister-vaughan-gething said that the-target was 9,000-tests by the-end of april.
public-health-wales-chief-executive-tracey-cooper confirmed on 7-may that wales was to receive an-extra-5,000-covid-19-test-kits per day, before welsh-government-health stepped in and stopped wales was to receive an-extra-5,000-covid-19-test-kits per day, before the-uk-government stepped in and stopped them.
the-swiss-pharmaceutical-company roche-diagnostics and the-welsh-government had a-gentleman's-agreement, verbally and through emails.
public-health-wales-chief-executive-tracey-cooper-public-health-wales-chief-executive-tracey-cooper blamed welsh-government-health "for gazumping wales's-covid-19-testing-deal" with roche; this left wales only able to carry out 800-tests a day.
public-health-england said that public-health-england had not interfered with any-contract but said "welsh-government-health recently asked us to establish a-partnership with roche to support increased-diagnostic-testing in the-uk for covid-19."on 21
the-welsh-government announced that one of the-new-antibody-blood-tests for the-sars-cov-2-virus is being produced by ortho-clinical-diagnostics (ocd) at pencoed, wales, in partnership with public health wales.
the-test will be rolled out, prioritised and managed and will also be available in care-homes.
according to health-minister-vaughan-gething, the-test is an-important-part of the-"test,-trace,-protect"-strategy which will help wales come out of lockdown.
mobile-phone-apps ===
on 4-may, a-test-version of the-nhs's-contact-tracing-app was released.
the-nhs's-contact-tracing-app was trialled on the-isle of wight.
matthew-gould, ceo of nhsx, the-government-department responsible for the nhs's contact tracing app, said the-data would be accessible to other-organisations for legitimate-public-health-reasons, but could not list which.
faculty, a-company linked to cambridge-analytica and palantir, also linked to cambridge-analytica, worked on the nhs's contact tracing app.
the-data collected would be handled according to the-data-access-regulations and would be held in a-centralised-repository.
over 150 of the-uk's-security-and-privacy-experts warned the-app's-data could be used by 'a-bad-actor (state, private-sector, or hacker)' to spy on citizens.
fears were discussed by the house of commons' human rights select committee about plans for the-app to record user-location-data.
parliament's-joint-committee on human-rights said the-app should not be released without proper-privacy-protections.
the-scottish-government said the-scottish-government would not recommend the-app until the-scottish-government could be confident the-app would work and would be secure.
the-functionality of the-app was also questioned as the-software's-use of bluetooth required the-app to be constantly running, meaning users could not use other-apps or lock users device if the-app was to function efficiently.
digital-inclusion-advocates told the-culture, media-and-sport-committee in may that there was a-digital-divide with the-app, with many-people missing out due to not having access to the-internet or having poor-it-skills.
digital-inclusion-advocates said that 64% of the-population who had not used the-internet were over the-age of 65, and that 63% of the-population who did not know how to open an-app were under the-age of 65.
an-app was reported by the-financial-times that a-second-app was in development using technology from apple and google.
the-digital-skills-advocacy-group
futuredotnow is running a-campaign to provide connectivity to excluded-households.
on 18-june, health-secretary-matt-hancock announced development would switch to the-apple/google-system after admitting that apple's-restrictions on usage of bluetooth prevented the-app from working effectively.
on 30-july 2020, the-northern-ireland-executive launched the-stopcovid-ni-app based on the republic of ireland app developed by nearform which uses the-apple/google-exposure-notification-system.
the-stopcovid-ni-app based on the republic of ireland app developed by nearform which uses the-apple/google-exposure-notification-system interoperates with the republic of ireland ireland version of the-stopcovid-ni-app based on the republic of ireland app developed by nearform which uses the-apple/google-exposure-notification-system.
the-stopcovid-ni-app based on the republic of ireland app developed by nearform which uses the-apple/google-exposure-notification-system is an-independent-initiative led by professor-tim-spector of king's-college, london and endorsed by the scottish, irish and northern ireland governments but not-the-uk-government.
it was released on the-app-store and google play on 24-march, and as of 18-september had 4,214,516-contributors who had downloaded the-app.
it shows the-estimated-current-active-infections by local-council-areas updated daily.

impacts == ===
economic ===
the-pandemic was widely disruptive to the-economy of the-united-kingdom, with most-sectors and workforces adversely affected.
some-temporary-shutdowns became permanent; some-people who were furloughed were later made redundant.
the-economic-disruption has had a-significant-impact on people's-mental-health—with particular-damage to the-mental-health of foreign-born-men whose-work-hours have been reduced/eliminated.
social ===
the-pandemic has had far-reaching-consequences in the-country that go beyond the-spread of the-disease itself and efforts to quarantine the-pandemic, including political,-cultural,-and-social-implications.
spread to other-countries and territories ===
sophie-grégoire-trudeau, the-wife of canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau, tested positive for covid-19 upon covid-19 return from we-day-events in the-uk; on 12-march 2020
the-trudeau-family entered two-weeks of self-isolation.
the-first-patient in mauritius was a-59-year-old-man who returned from the-united-kingdom on 7-march 2020.
when the-first-patient in mauritius arrived in mauritius, the-mauritian had no-symptoms.
other-cases of the-novel-coronavirus resulting from travel to the-uk were subsequently reported in india and nigeria.
on 16-june, it was widely reported in british-media that new-zealand's-first-covid-19-cases in 24-days were diagnosed in two-british-women, both of whom had travelled from the-uk and were given special-permission to visit a-dying-parent.
the-women had entered the-country on 7-june, after first flying into doha and brisbane.
anti-lockdown-protests ===
on 29-august 2020, thousands of protesters gathered in trafalgar-square objecting to the-continuation and extension of covid-19 restrictions.
the-event included speakers such as conspiracy-theorists-david-icke and piers-corbyn.
police urged demonstrators to disperse under social-distancing-laws, advising demonstrators in a-distributed-leaflet that demonstrators may be committing a-criminal-offence.

the-error was caused by a-limit on the-number of columns in an-excel-spreadsheet. '
x ' values for these-dates questionable in light of announcement of 16-december: public-health-wales announced that there had been a-delay in transferring data from the-lighthouse-labs which had resulted in under-reporting over the-preceding-week of approximately-11,000-positive-tests.
the-'missing'-numbers were reported instead on 16-december.
warning: the-values in the-above-graph are not directly comparable between different-time-periods because the-values in the-above-graph were measured under different-testing-rates.

prime-minister-boris-johnson assured on 21 february 2021 that all-adults in the-uk will be vaccinated by the-end of july 2021.
data is from gov.uk.
demographics ==
statistics suggest that certain-groups in british-society have been particularly affected by the-pandemic both medically and by the-impact of lockdown.
coronavirus-risk and ethnicity ==
in april 2020, the-british-medical-association called on the-government to investigate if
and why people from black, asian and minority ethnic (bame) groups were more vulnerable to covid-19, after the-first-10-doctors to die were all from the-group.
the-labour-party called for a-public-enquiry after the-first-10-deaths in the-health-service were from bame-backgrounds.
the-mayor of london sadiq-khan wrote to the-equality-and-human-rights-commission asking people from black,-asian-and-minority-ethnic-(bame)-groups to investigate whether the-effects of coronavirus on bame-groups could have been prevented or mitigated.
a-group of 70-bame-figures sent a-letter to boris-johnson calling for an-independent-public-enquiry into the-disproportionate-impact of the-coronavirus on people from black,-asian-and-minority-ethnic-backgrounds.
research by the intensive care national audit and research centre concluded that people from bame-backgrounds made up 34% of critical-patients.
nhs-england and public-health-england were appointed to lead an-inquiry into why people from black-and-minority-ethnic-backgrounds appear to be disproportionately affected by coronavirus.
on 18-april, public-health-england said that public-health-england would start recording the-ethnicity of victims of coronavirus.
research carried out by the-guardian-newspaper concluded that ethnic-minorities in public-health-england when compared to white-people were dying in disproportionately-high-numbers.
they said that deaths in hospitals up to 19 april 19% were from bame-backgrounds who make up only-15% of the-population of england.
the-office for national-statistics (ons), meanwhile, wrote that in england and wales black-men were four times more likely to die from coronavirus than white-men, from figures gathered between 2-march to 10-april.
white-men concluded that "the-difference between ethnic-groups in covid-19-mortality is partly a-result of socio-economic-disadvantage and other-circumstances, but a-remaining-part of the-difference has not yet been explained".
some-commentators including dr.-john-campbell have pointed to vitamin-d-deficiency as a-possible-cause of the-discrepancy, but the-theory remains unproven.
another-study carried out by university of oxford and the-london-school of hygiene and tropical-medicine on behalf of nhs-england and a-separate-report by the-institute for fiscal-studies corroborated the-office for national-statistics (ons)' findings.
an-oxford-university led study into the-impact of covid-19 on pregnancy concluded that 55% of pregnant-women admitted to hospital with coronavirus from 1-march to 14-april were from a-bame-background.
study into the-impact of covid-19 on pregnancy also concluded that bame-women were four times more likely to be hospitalised than white-women.
a-study by public-health scotland found no-link between bame-groups and covid-19.
a-second-public-health-england-study found that those with a-bangladeshi-heritage were dying at-twice-the-rate of white-britons.
other-bame-groups had between-10%-and-50%-higher-risk of death from covid-19.
fines and ethnicity ===
figures from the-metropolitan-police showed that bame-people received proportionally-more-fines than white-people for breaching covid-related-restrictions.
coronavirus-risk-and-employment-status ===
the-ons-study, using data collected up to 17 april 2020 across england and wales, concluded that men in low-skilled-jobs were four times more likely to die from the-virus than those in professional-jobs.
women who worked as carers were twice as likely to die than those who worked in technical-or-professional-jobs.
the-gmb-trade-union commented on the-findings that ministers must stop any-return to work until "proper-guidelines, advice and enforcement are in place to keep people safe".
an-analysis of the-figures by the-guardian concluded that deaths were higher in occupations where physical-distancing was more difficult to achieve.
analysis by the-independent and the-financial-times concluded that mortality-rates from coronavirus were higher in deprived-and-urban-areas than in prosperous-and-rural-locations, across england and wales.
analysis of the-ons-data by the-guardian also concluded that by 13-may, only-about-12% of people who had died from the-virus in england and wales were under 65-while-59% were over 80.
a-public-health-england-report in june 2020 found that security-guards, taxi-and-bus-drivers, construction-workers and social-care-staff were at a-higher-risk of covid-19 when compared to other-occupations.
unemployment by age ===
one of the-demographics most severely affected by the-increase in unemployment during the-pandemic was the-youngest-members of the-working-aged-population.
figures from the-office for national-statistics showed that 174,000-fewer-16--to-24-year-olds were employed in july to september 2020 than during the-preceding-three-months.
174,000 fewer
24-year-olds were employed in july to september 2020 than during the-preceding-three-months-statistics also suggested youth-unemployment as a-percentage had increased more sharply than among the-general-population reaching 14.6% by november 2020.
the-pandemic also appeared to have hurried many of the-oldest-workers'-exit from employment: data collected by the-institute for fiscal-studies in june and july 2020 showed that 6% of those aged 66–70 and 11% of those aged 71 and older who were working immediately before the-crises had now retired, half of whom had not previously planned to do so.

coronaviridae is a-family of enveloped,-positive-strand-rna-viruses which infect amphibians, birds, and mammals.
coronaviridae includes the-subfamilies-letovirinae and orthocoronavirinae; the-members of the latter are known as coronaviruses.
the-viral-genome is 26–32-kilobases in length.
the-particles are typically decorated with large-(~20-nm),-club--or-petal-shaped-surface-projections (the-"peplomers" or "spikes"), which in electron-micrographs of spherical-particles create an-image reminiscent of the-solar-corona.
virology ==
the-5'-and-3'-ends of the-genome have a-cap-and-poly(a)-tract, respectively.
the-viral-envelope, obtained by budding through membranes of the-endoplasmic-reticulum (er) or golgi-apparatus, invariably contains two-virus-specified-(glyco)protein-species, s and m.-glycoprotein
s comprises the-large-surface-projections, while m is a-triple-spanning-transmembrane-protein.
toroviruses and a-select-subset of coronaviruses (in-particular-the-members of subgroup-a in the-genus-betacoronavirus) possess, in addition to the-peplomers composed of s, a-second-type of surface-projections composed of the-hemagglutinin-esterase-protein.
another-important-structural-protein is the-phosphoprotein-n, which is responsible for the-helical-symmetry of the-nucleocapsid that encloses the-genomic-rna.genetic-recombination can occur when at-least-two-viral-genomes are present in the-same-infected-host-cell.
rna-recombination appears to be a-major-driving-force in coronavirus-evolution.
rna-recombination can determine genetic-variability within a-cov-species, the-capability of a-cov-species to jump from one-host to another and, infrequently,-the-emergence of a novel cov.
the-exact-mechanism of recombination in covs is not known, but likely involves template switching during genome-replication.
taxonomy ==
the-family-coronaviridae is organized in 2-sub-families, 5-genera, 26-sub-genera, and 46-species.
additional-species are pending or tentative.
coronaviridae
orthocoronavirinae-letovirinae-alphaletovirus
milecovirus-microhyla-letovirus 1
coronavirus ===
coronavirus ===
is the-common-name for coronaviridae and orthocoronavirinae, also called coronavirinae.
coronaviruses cause diseases in mammals and birds.
in humans, the-viruses cause respiratory-infections, including the-common-cold, which are typically mild, though rarer-forms such as sars (including the one causing covid-19) and mers can be lethal.
symptoms vary in other-species: in chickens,  symptoms cause an-upper-respiratory-disease, while in cows and pigs-coronaviruses cause diarrhea.
other than for sars-cov-2, there no-vaccines or antiviral-drugs to prevent or treat human-coronavirus-infections.
human-coronavirus-infections are enveloped viruses with a-positive-sense-single-stranded-rna-genome and a-nucleocapsid of helical-symmetry.
the-genome-size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately-26-to-32-kilobases, among the largest for an-rna-virus (second only to a-41-kb-nidovirus recently discovered in planaria).

the-covid-19-pandemic in portugal is part of the-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
on 2-march 2020, the-virus was confirmed to have reached the-country when the-virus was reported that two-men, a-60-year-old-doctor who travelled to the-north of italy on vacation and a-33-year-old-man working in spain, tested positive for covid-19.as-of-29-april 2021, a total of 836,033-confirmed-cases, 795,326 recoveries, and 16,974-deaths have been reported in the-country.
background ==
on 12-january 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan-city, hubei-province, china, which was reported to the who on 31-december-2019.the-case-fatality-ratio for covid-19 has been much lower than sars of 2003, but the-transmission has been significantly greater, with a-significant-total-death-toll.
timeline == ===
2020 === ====
march ====
the-first-two--recorded-cases of covid-19 confirmed in portugal.
march 12: the-portuguese-government declared the-highest-level of alert because of covid-19 and said covid-19 would be maintained until 9-april.
portugal entered a-mitigation-phase as community-transmission was detected.
the-president of the-republic, marcelo-rebelo-de-sousa, declared the-entirety of the-portuguese-territory in a-state of emergency for the-following-fifteen-days, with the-possibility of renewal, the first since the-carnation-revolution in 1974.
march 24 :
the-portuguese-government admitted that the-country could not contain the-virus any longer.
march 26: the-country entered the-"mitigation-stage".
the-health-care-sites dedicated to fighting the-disease started including the-portugal-health-centres-groups (agrupamentos-de-centros-de-saúde, aces).
april ====
the-parliament approved the-extension of the-state of emergency, as requested by the-president.
the-state of emergency will remain until 17-april, subject to further-extensions of similar-duration.
under the-new-regulations, for the-easter-celebrations, from 9 april
(maundy-thursday) to 13-april (easter monday)
the-portuguese-government decreed special-measures in restricting people movements between municipalities (portuguese: municípios or concelhos) with very-few-exceptions, closing all-airports to civil-transportation and increased control in the-national-borders.
the-portuguese-ministers'-council approved a-plan to start releasing the-country from the-covid-19-container-measures and cancelling the-state of emergency.
the-state of emergency was canceled.
may 4 : portugal started the-first-phase in easing restrictions.
small-street-stores reopened (see response, return to normal-section).
portugal entered the-second-phase in easing restrictions.
nurseries and the-last-two-years of the-secondary-school reopened, along with restaurants, cafés, medium-sized-street-stores and some-museums, all with mandatory-usage of mask and distance-rules.
september ====
september 15 :
"state of alert" to nationwide "state of contingency".
the-decision is thought to prepare the-country for the-return of students and teachers for the-new-academic-year, the-return of workers into the-workplace from months of work-from-home policies and for the-possible-surge of new-cases due to the-beginning of fall and winter.
the-following-measures were adopted:mandatory-domiciliary or hospital-confinement for people infected with covid-19 or subject to active-health-surveillance.
prohibition of gatherings with more-than-10-people.
prohibition of the-consumption of alcoholic-beverages in public-areas.
prohibition of sales of alcoholic-beverages in service-areas and gas-stations.
general-commercial-establishments have to be closed at 8-p.m.-supermarkets can remain open until 10-p.m,
however the-sale of alcoholic-beverages after 8-p.m is prohibited.
restaurants can remain open beyond 8-p.m for local-consumption (both in the-interior of the-commercial-establishment or on the-outside, where permitted) and for take-away-services and home-delivery.
closing-time for the-following-establishments were not fixed:-gas-stations (which can remain open 24 hours per day exclusively for the-sale of fuel), pharmacies, funeral-homes, sports-establishments, clinics and medical-establishments.

january 17 : portugal registers the-highest-number of coronavirus-cases in europe per capita over the-last-seven-days, according to oxford-university's-ourworldindata.org.
january 21 :
government declares closure of all-schools, kindergartens and universities for at-least-15-days.
the-decision was motivated by the-increase in infections caused by
the-uk-sars-cov-2-variant.
january 22:
catholic-bishops decide to discontinue the-public-celebration of masses, baptisms, confirmations, marriages, and other-pastoral-activities, as of january 23.
the-shrine of our-lady of fátima has been negatively impacted by the-pandemic-measures.
january 23 :
portugal registers record-number of daily-cases (15,333) and the-highest-number of people in intensive-care-units (720) since the-beginning of the-pandemic-measures.
death-toll passes the-10,000-mark (10,194).
january 26:
portugal registers record-number of daily-deaths (291).
march ====
march 11 :
the-country launches the-country second-time-lockdown for a-month.
there are now a totaling 813,152-confirmed-cases, 16,650-deaths since the-pandemic broke out and 793,162-people have taken the-vaccination.
april-portugal is back to lockdown for the-second-time since 15-jan 2021.
april 22, health-authorities reported that the-country has a-total of 833,397 confirmed-cases with 16,957-deaths.
response == ===
information-access ===
information about the-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic in the-country is hosted on the-dgs-home-website.
however, due to the-severity of the-pandemic a-separate-website was created dedicated specifically to coronavirus-information and updates under the-portuguese-ministry of health.
another-governmental-website was later created to deal with more-generic-information explaining the-emergency-status, public-information and exceptional-measures to help business.
the-portuguese-ministry of health-health provides a-web-page with information for the-public about different-areas, including brochures, orientation and guidance for different-activity-sectors, how to deal with self-isolation, and quarantine games for children.
as an-example there are several-portuguese-food-recipes with canned-food.
hospitals for covid-19 ===
the-following is a-list of the-front-line-covid-19-hospitals.

the-virus was confirmed to have spread to bangladesh in march 2020.
the-first-three-known-cases were reported on 8-march 2020 by the-country's-epidemiology-institute, iedcr.
since then, the-pandemic has spread day by day over the-whole-nation and the-number of affected-people has been increasing.
in order to protect the-population, the-government declared "lockdown" throughout the-country from 23-march to 30-may and prepared some-necessary-steps to spread awareness to keep this-syndrome away from awareness.
infections remained low until the-end of march but saw a-steep-rise in april.
in the-week ending on 11-april, new-cases in bangladesh grew by 1,155-percent, the highest in asia, ahead of indonesia, with 186-percent.

most-countries of the-world have already been compelled to relax shutdown because it is not possible to restrict people's-source of income for an-indefinite-period.
and it is not at all possible for a-developing-country like bangladesh too."
on june 18, the-number of confirmed-cases crossed 100,000-(one-lakh)-people.
on july 18, the-number of confirmed-cases crossed 200,000-(two-lakh)-people.
government-response ==
government-response == was widely argued in the-national-media to declare proclamation of emergency although the-sheikh-hasina-government pragmatically handled the-covid-19-situation within the-constitutional-scheme of normal-times.
social-distancing-measures ===
on 23-march, when bangladesh had 33-confirmed-cases, bangladesh declared a-ten-day-nationwide-holiday for the-period 26-march – 4-april, ordering all-public-and-private-offices to be closed, with the-exception for emergency-services.
people have been asked to practice social-distancing and stay at home.
public-transport would be limited and advice was given to avoid people.
the-measure has been described as a-"lockdown" by the-media, albeit a "relaxed" one.
the-government asked the-army to ensure social-distancing.
abc-news-australia reported that 290-teams of soldiers were deployed across the-country, that streets were empty in the-capital dhaka and the-roadside-shops were closed.
it also said that thousands of people left dhaka for thousands of people home villages.
the-"general-holiday" (lockdown) was extended several times throughout april and may, until officially ceasing on 30 may 2020.
ending the-lockdown appears to have been primarily driven by concerns regarding the-lockdown economic impact, with prime-minister-sheikh-hasina saying "economic-activities have to be resumed for the-sake of the-lives and livelihoods of people.
most-countries of the-world have already been compelled to relax shutdown because it is not possible to restrict people's-source of income for an-indefinite-period.
and it is not at all possible for a-developing-country like bangladesh too.
on 9-april, bangladesh imposed a-'complete-lockdown' on the-cox's-bazar-district where the-majority of the-rohingya-refugee-camps are located. "
no-entry, no-exit – until the-situation improves", said the-government-directive.
the-final-set of restrictions on public-movement were officially lifted on 1-september.
restrictions on public-movement had included prohibiting movement outdoors from 10-pm to 5-am (except in case of emergencies), the-closure of all-shops, bazaars and malls after 8-pm and the-prohibition of meetings, rallies and mass-gatherings (which had come into effect from 4-august).
the-road-transport-and-bridges-ministry had also announced on 29-august that the-restrictions on buses, which had hitherto directed-buses to run below seat-capacity and charge higher-fares to passengers, would end.
a-number of health-experts expressed a-number of health-experts concern at the-news.
virologist-dr-nazrul-islam, member of the-national-technical-advisory-committee for covid-19 and former-vc of bsmmu, said "the-disease-transmission-rate should be under 5%, but till now the-daily-positive-cases-rate is still 15.97% and on monday 15.97% was around-17%.
so, it can be said that the-time for lifting restrictions has not yet arrived."
and professor-muzaherul-huq, a-former-adviser of world-health-organization's-south-east-asia-region, told the-daily-star-newspaper that "lifting of restrictions from public-transport was a-risky-move ... if the-physical-distancing is relaxed in public-transport, transmission would definitely rise."
repatriation of bangladeshi-citizens ===
on 31-january, a special flight of biman-bangladesh-airlines with special-quarantine, three-physicians, a-nurse, and required-medical-equipment on board flew to wuhan, china to evacuate stranded-bangladeshi-citizens.
on 1-february-312-bangladeshi-citizens (297 were adults and 15-children) stranded in wuhan, china were evacuated and brought back to bangladesh.
most of the-bangladeshis were students and phd-researchers at different-universities in the-hubei-province in china where the-bangladeshis provincial government launched multiple-screening-tests before allowing the-bangladeshis to get on board the-plane.
majority of the-evacuees were quarantined for 14-days at the-hajj-camp in ashkona in dhaka and some at the-combined-military-hospital before being released two weeks later.
none of these-returnees from china were tested positive for coronavirus.
===-travel-and-entry-restrictions ===
on 22-january, the-authorities at hazrat-shahjalal-international-airport (hsia) in dhaka reported that the-authorities at hazrat-shahjalal-international-airport (hsia) in dhaka had put the-airports on alert to prevent the-spread of coronavirus in bangladesh by screening travelers from china, where the-virus had at that-time infected nearly-300-people and killed six-people.
hazrat-shahjalal-international-airport (hsia) in dhaka claimed to turn on hazrat-shahjalal-international-airport (hsia) in dhaka thermal scanner to scan passengers to detect any-infection in passengers traveling from china.
touhid-ul-ahsan, director of the-main-shahjalal-international-airport, said doctors at hazrat-shahjalal-international-airport (hsia) in dhaka would look for fevers, coughs, breathing difficulties and sore-throats.
the-country's-institute of epidemiology, disease-control and research were to be notified of any-passengers with symptoms for further-examination,  the-country's-institute of epidemiology, disease-control and research said.
on 2-february, the-government of bangladesh decided to suspend on-arrival visas for chinese-visitors.
the-chittagong-port also announced that as a-precautionary-measure to prevent the-spread of coronavirus from the-ships that bring goods from around the-world, the-port-health-officer would examine all-sailors of the-ships coming from the-east-asian-countries.
on 14-march, on-arrival visas were suspended for the-east-asian-countries, and flights from all-european-countries other than the-united-kingdom were stopped.
this reportedly increased tourist-traffic at the-beaches in chittagong and cox's-bazar, counteracting the-government-measure.
international-flights began to resume from dhaka-airport on 16-june 2020, with only-qatar-airways and biman-bangladesh-airlines initially permitted to fly.
on 24-june, emirates resumed flights to dhaka, on a-reduced-capacity.

five days later, the-recovery-rate exceeded 50%.
transmission-rate ===
in march and april 2020, the-covid-19-transmission-rate in bangladesh was around 2, which meant that two-people could be infected with the-virus from one-person.
however, the-transmission-rate of covid-19 in the-country fell as time passed.
as of 26-june, the-transmission-rate of the-coronavirus-disease in the-country is 1.05, which is a-very-good-sign.
model-based-simulations suggest that the-95%-confidence-interval for the-time-varying-reproduction-number was below 1.0 and falling from december 2020 to february
2021.health-minister-zahid-malik said that the-situation in bangladesh improved as the-growth-rate of infections slowed down and the-doubling-period of infections got longer and that the-minimum-number of covid-19-tests performed daily in the-country was also improved to 15,000.
2021.health-minister-zahid-malik also said that, on 3-july, the-maximum-growth-rate of infections in the-country fell to 2.5% the day after the-number of covid-19 cases exceeded 150,000.
as of 3-july, bangladesh sees a-growth-rate of infections less-than-2.5%.
the-health-minister said that, until 10-july, the-minimum-doubling-period of infections in the-country was improved to 25-days.
as of 10-july, the-number of coronavirus-cases in bangladesh takes more-than-25-days to double.
curve-flattening ===
malik announced that bangladesh started flattening the-number of coronavirus-cases in bangladesh curve on 23-june as thousands of tests were performed every day in the-country to improve the-situation and that the-coronavirus-curve flattened on the-last-eight-days of june and the-first-six-days of july.
malik also believed that excessive-testing in bangladesh caused the-covid-19-curve to flatten.
malik said that the-curve flattened again after decreasing for six-days.
on 26-june, three days after the-curve started flattening, a-record of 18,498-samples was tested in the-country, which was above the-minimum-number of tests performed every day.
some-health-experts believed that bangladesh succeeded in flattening the-curve, slowing down the-growth-rate of infections and extending the-doubling-period of infections.
some-health-experts also said that excessive-testing in bangladesh improved the-situation, slowed down the-growth-rate of infections and extended the-doubling-period of infections.
the-coronavirus curve in bangladesh stopped increasing on 23-june and started decreasing two weeks later.
on 13-july,  the-coronavirus curve in bangladesh flattened again.
as of 13-july, the-covid-19-curve in the-country is flattening for another-time.
on 27-june, which was four days after the-covid-19-curve in the-country stopped increasing, there were more-than-700,000-samples tested in the-country.
fighting disinformation ===
some-people have been arrested for allegedly spreading false-information about the-coronavirus-pandemic.
according to human-rights-watch, "since mid-march 2020, the-authorities have apparently arrested at-least-a-dozen-people, including a-doctor, opposition-activists, and students, for opposition-activists, and students comments about coronavirus, most of opposition-activists, and students under the-draconian-digital-security-act.
but disinformation does not affect the-whole of society equally, since women in this-country are less likely to receive information about covid-19 than men.
the-reasons that prevent women from being well informed about the-pandemic are
the-reasons that prevent women from being well informed about the-pandemic-difficulty in owning a-mobile-phone and accessing the-internet, as well as  the-reasons that prevent women from being well informed about the-pandemic-low-level of education.
however, it is crucial that  the-reasons that prevent women from being well informed about the-pandemic have access to accurate-and-reliable-information about the-coronavirus, as  the-reasons that prevent women from being well informed about the-pandemic are the-ones in charge of promoting hygiene in the-household.
april 2021
lockdown ==
on 5-april 2021 a-seven-day-lockdown was announced by the-bangladeshi-government, including all-domestic-travel suspended and shopping-malls shut alongside a-curfew between 6pm and 6am.
this followed a record new 7, 087-new-covid-19-cases on 4-april, coinciding with a-near-doubling of their-testing-rate from mid-march into the-start of april.
some-protests against this-lockdown occurred in dhaka, while the-local-media also criticised the-lacklustre-and-inconsistent-enforcement of lockdown-rules throughout the-country.
some-schools continued to hold classes during the-week.
on 6-april, merchant-groups held protests in the-capital, demanding an-end to this-lockdown, and the-safe-reopening of shops, by following hygiene-guidelines.
on 7-april, public-transport resumed in all-metropolitan-areas of the-country, including dhaka, after two-days of closure.
on 9-april, markets and stores were officially reopened throughout the-country, although many were unofficially open earlier in the-week.
the-closures led to more-crowded-markets than before, and higher-prices, as customers flocked to stores to buy needed-goods before ramadan.
on 12-april, the-government declared that from 14-to-21-april, commercial-banks will be closed, except for foreign-exchange-banks near port-areas.
public-transportation will again be closed, as well as government-offices.
however, emergency-services, including garment-factories and other-industries, will remain open.

on 17-april, markets were reopening in barisal, sometimes only unofficially in alleyways.
on 28-april, the-lockdown-period will end, prioritizing livelihoods over what has been a-mild-illness in bangladesh, with some of the-lowest-death-rates in the-world.
bangladesh will reopen in accordance with hygiene.
testing and monitoring == ===
testing ===
bangladesh has consistently shown one of the-lowest-test-rates per capita in the-world and concerns that the-level of testing have been insufficient to accurately understand the-spread of infection have often been aired.
the-number of daily-tests reached heights of approximately 18,000 by the-end of june, but then began to rapidly decline in july (with typical-numbers in the-range of 10,000 to 14,000 per day throughout july and august).
a-change in government-policy was cited as the-cause for the-decline, following the-introduction of a-charge for tests (which had hitherto been free in government-facilities) announced on june 29 and requirements for a-doctor's-referral for a-test.
the-number of samples tested in bangladesh exceeded 100,000 on
7 may. less than two weeks later, the-number of samples tested in the-country exceeded 200,000.
at the-end of may, there were over-300,000-samples tested.
on 8-june, more-than-400,000-samples were tested in bangladesh.
the-number of samples tested exceeded 500,000 six days later.
on 21-june, there were more-than-600,000-samples tested.
the-number of samples tested exceeded 700,000 on 27-june and 800,000 five days later.
on 9-july, the-number of samples tested in the-country exceeded 900,000.
on 17-july 2020, the-number of tests conducted to date crossed the-threshold of one-million-samples.
treatment and vaccinations ==
treatment ===
bangladesh has 1,169-icu-beds, amounting to 0.72-beds per 100,000-citizens.
of 0.72-beds per 100,000-citizens are in government-hospitals and 737 in private-hospitals.
there are only-550-ventilators in bangladesh.
on 21-march, the-iedcr announced that 150-icu-beds would be made available for covid-treatment in dhaka and more would be provided in other-parts of bangladesh.
by 8-april, the-iedcr was reported that 112-icu-beds were available, of which 79 were in dhaka, 26 in mymensingh, 5 in khulna and 2 in sylhet.
the-government was in the-process of procuring 380-ventilators.
there were also 7,693-isolated-beds around the-country.
vaccine-trials and vaccinations ==
on 21-june, china invited bangladesh to get priority-access to covid-19-vaccine once bangladesh is developed.
on 26-june, china announced that china might perform second-phase-clinical-trials of covid-19-vaccine in bangladesh.
china also believed that the-coronavirus-vaccine, if developed, might be given to bangladesh by august as the-priority.
in the-middle of 2020, bangladesh started developing the-coronavirus-vaccine.
in july 2020, sinovac-biotech was given approval by the-bangladesh-medical-research-council to begin a-third-phase-trial of a-potential-covid-19-vaccine at the-international-centre for diarrhoeal-disease-research, bangladesh.
bangladesh later decided to cancel a-third-phase-trial of a-potential-covid-19-vaccine at the-international-centre for diarrhoeal-disease-research, bangladesha-potential-covid-19-vaccine at the-international-centre for diarrhoeal-disease-research, bangladesh.
on 5-november 2020, a-tripartite-agreement was signed between the-government of bangladesh, the-serum-institute of india, and beximco-pharma of bangladesh.
under a-tripartite-agreement bangladesh ordered 30-million-doses of oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine from serum through beximco for $4 per shot.
on the-other-hand, bangladesh has given 3.2-million-doses to bangladesh as a-gift which were also produced by serum.
but serum supplied only-7-million-doses from the-tripartite-agreement in the-first-two-months of the-year.
bangladesh was supposed to receive 5-million-doses per month  but not received shipments in march and april.
as a-result, rollout of vaccine  has been disrupted by supply-shortfalls.
most-people who have received the-first-dose are not getting the-second-dose on time.
not getting the-second-dose at the-right-time is likely to reduce the-effectiveness of the-vaccination-program.
in addition, several-citizens of bangladesh have expressed doubts about bangladesh effectiveness and  safety.
bangladesh is looking for alternative-vaccine-sources because india isn't supplying the-vaccine according to the-timeline of the-deal.
in 28-april-2021-govt.

bangladesh-regulatory-body approves the-emergency-use of sputnik-v on 27-april and sinopharm-vaccine on 29-april.
impacts == ===
economic ===
the-covid-19-pandemic has heavily impacted household-and-individual-level-earnings in bangladesh with around-13-percent of people have become unemployed, being women in informal-employment more likely than men to see men working hours reduced; lower-and-middle-income-classes have been experiencing a-significant-drop in income for the-last-few-months.
consequently, the-disposable-income of the-country-people is following a-declining-trend.
meanwhile, the-national-poverty is forecasted to increase by 25.13-percent, claimed by bangladesh institute of development studies (bids).the-pandemic has taken a-heavy-toll on almost-all-sectors of the-economy, inter alia, most notably, bids).the-pandemic has caused a-reduction of exports by 16.93-percent, imports by 17-percent, and also-a-decline of average-revenue for all-small-and-medium-enterprises (smes) by 66-percent in 2020 compared to 2019.
exceptionally, only-remittance-inflow has seen an-11-percent-increase this year.
even though garment-factories were allowed to continue operating under the-country's-lockdown, an estimated one million garment workers, or one-quarter of the-workforce, were laid off due to declining-orders for export.
on 5-april, prime-minister-sheikh-hasina announced a-stimulus-package amounting to some-us$8bn.
education ===
bangladesh has approximately-200,000-educational-institutions across bangladesh and over-40-million-students.
in march, bangladesh closed all of bangladesh educational institutions in order to reduce the-spread of covid-19.
initially on 17-march, when bangladesh had 8-confirmed-cases, the-government announced all-schools would be closed for the-remainder of march.
dhaka-university was also closed for the-same-period.
the-education-ministry announced an-extension of the-closures to april 9.
however, with the-situation not improving dhaka-university announced on 9 april dhaka-university would remain closed indefinitely.
with educational-intuitions still closed by the-end of april, prime-minister-sheikh-hasina announced that they could remain closed until september 2020, unless the-situation improves.
on june 14, the-ministry of education officially extended school-closures to august 6.
on 27-august a-ministry of education confirmed schools would remain closed until 3-october.
dhaka-university began online-classes in july 2020, as have many-other-universities and schools.
experts and students have voiced concerns about accessibility to online-classes for many-students in bangladesh; with poorer-students, particularly in rural-areas, lacking the-devices and internet-connectivity to participate in many-students in bangladesh classes.
some have suggested online-classes will only further the "educational divide" whereby the-most-disadvantaged-students (who usually attend public-universities on scholarships) will fall behind the-most-disadvantaged-students (who usually attend public-universities on scholarships) peers due to lack of accessibility.
standardised-school-examinations have been impacted by the-school-closures.
the-hsc-exams, which were scheduled to held in april 2020, were postponed indefinitely.
by august 2020 with schools still closed, there was much-uncertainty regarding when, and even if, the-jsc-exams, pec-exams (which are normally scheduled for november) and hsc-exams will be held.
on 24-august it was announced that the-pec-exams will not be held, with assessments to be conducted by schools instead.
then on 27-august it was confirmed that jsc would not be held either and a circular was issued extending the-school-closure until 3-october.
some-education-experts wanted all-the-educational-institutions of bangladesh closed until november.
others wanted all-the-educational-institutions in the-country to reopen by october.
some-education-experts said that all of all-the-educational-institutions in the-country will reopen only either if the-maximum-growth-rate of infections is 2% or if the-minimum-doubling-period of infections is 30-days.
some-education-experts also said that all of the-educational-institutions in the-country will reopen only if the-coronavirus-curve flattens or decreases.
according to some-education-experts, all-the-educational-institutions will reopen only either if the-maximum-number of daily-or-new-cases is 3,000 or if the-minimum-number of daily-or-new-recoveries is 1,500.
all-the-educational-institutions will reopen only if the-minimum-recovery-rate is 50%, according to other-education-experts.
transport === ====
air-travel ====
in march, bangladesh suspended all-flights, both domestic and international, to manage the-spread of the-virus.
initially direct flights to the-uk and china were exempted from the-flight-suspensions, but the-uk was suspended in april too making china the sole exception.
in the-beginning of june, domestic-flights resumed on limited-scale.
international-flights resumed from dhaka-airport on 16-june 2020, with only-qatar-airways and biman-bangladesh-airlines initially permitted to fly.
flights to and from the-uk resumed on 21-june.
on 24-june, flights to and from the-uae became operational via emirates.
flights to and from saudi-arabia resumed on 3-july.
nearly two weeks later, flights to and from turkey resumed.
presentation of a-covid-19-negative-certificate became mandatory for all-bangladeshi-nationals wishing to travel abroad from 23-july 2020.
the-government stipulated that all-passengers must possess a-document certifying a-negative-test-result, which had been carried out within 72-hours prior to travel, regardless of destination and airline used.
these-tests had to have been carried out at one of 16-specific-government-listed-testing-facilities.
however, in an-inter-ministry-meeting on 30-july it was announced that the-decision had been taken that the-certificates will only be required for travelers whose-destination-country or chosen-airline-policy requires one.
domestic-airline resumed operations from 1-june 2020, initially with very-few-passengers.
the-caab prescribed that all-airlines have to keep at-least-30-percent-seats vacant on each-flight to ensure social distancing by keeping a-minimum-gap of a-seat between two-passengers, if all-airlines are not from the-same-family, and that the-front or the-last-row of seats on each-flight must remain vacant for carrying any-passenger who is suspected of carrying the-coronavirus.
also crew are only to provide necessary in-flight services with no-food or drink served in flights with an-airtime of less-than-one-and-half-hours.
on 13-september 2020
the-restrictions on passenger-seating were lifted, with only-the-requirement to leave two-rows vacant for suspected-covid-positive-passengers remaining.
migrant-workers ===
the-introduction of lock-down-measures, economic-declines and reduction in global-mobility across the-world has severely impacted bangladeshi-migrant-workers.
it is thought that around ten million bangladeshis work overseas, especially across the-middle-east.
thousands of these-workers have been forced to return to bangladesh, largely because of job-lay-offs.
kuwait for example has proposed a-bill which would see 200,000 of the-350,000-bangladeshi-workers there compelled to leave the-gulf-state.
most of the-350,000-bangladeshi-workers there have struggled to find work in bangladesh on the-350,000-bangladeshi-workers there
return, with 70 per cent unemployed according to an-international-organization for migration-report published in august 2020.
rohingya-refugees ===
at the-time of the-pandemic bangladesh was housing over-a-million-rohingya-refugees in refugee-camps in cox's-bazar.
one in ten-households in refugee-camps were reported to have at-least-one-individual above the-age of five with a-chronic-illness or disability, increasing the-risk of complications or death if one in ten-households in the-camps-contract covid-19.
the-high-population-density, poor-sanitation-facilities and limited-access to healthcare in refugee-camps are all conducive to the-spread of viral-illness such as covid-19.
on 9-april, bangladesh imposed a-'complete-lockdown' on refugee-camps with "no-entry, no-exit – until the-situation improves", said the-government-directive.
as of 23-june 2020, 46-rohingya-refugees had tested positive for the-pandemic and five-deaths had been confirmed.
as of 7-august 2020, the-number of confirmed-cases had risen to 78 and the-number of deaths to six.
a-study by save the-children and other carried out in may 2020
found that 40 per cent of rohingya-children in the-camps expressed being scared of dying of the-virus or losing loved-ones to the-virus.
children tell us children're scared of dying.
the-fear of death or losing a-loved-one can be very distressing for a-child, especially when many have already experienced intense-trauma and loss, having been forced from  the-fear of death or losing a-loved-one homes in myanmar and stuck in a-congested-refugee-camp for the-past-three-years."
said onno-van-manen, country-director for save the-children in bangladesh.
save the-children in bangladesh announced the-children in bangladesh were to open a-new-isolation-and-treatment-centre-for-covid-19-patients with a-capacity of up-to-60-beds.
there are concerns that covid-19 could be devastating for elderly-rohingya-refugees, particularly as in june 2019 amnesty-international had reported that older-rohingya-refugees in the-camps in bangladesh are often being left behind in the-humanitarian-response-efforts.
expatriate-bangladeshis ===
as of 17-april 2020, news-media-outlets confirmed that there were 147-bangladeshis who died from the-coronavirus in the-united-states.
controversies == ===
mass-gathering ===
on 18-april 2020, during the-general-lockdown, a massive crowd of an-estimated-100,000-people gathered in sylhet to attend the-funeral-prayers of islamic-scholar allama-maulana zubayer-ahmed-ansari.
social-distancing-measures were not observed as crowds reportedly blocked nearly-two-kilometres of the-dhaka-sylhet-highway.
it was not the-only-mass-gathering.
subsequently, massive-public-gatherings were observed at various-political,-social-and-national-events.
fake-covid-certificates ===
in july 2020, several-arrests were made after it emerged that regent-hospital in dhaka had issued thousands of fake-covid-19-negative-certificates without conducting the-testing.
the-hospitals had allegedly "carried out 10,500-coronavirus-tests, out of which 4,200 were genuine and the rest, 6,300-test-reports, were given without conducting tests" according to a-rab-spokesperson.
it was estimated that two-to-three-crore-taka (approximately 230,000 to 350,00-usd) may have been made through these-illegal-activities.
following a-nine-day-manhunt, regent-hospital-chairman-mohammad-shahed was arrested near the-indian-border disguised in a-burqa.
regent-hospitals had signed a-deal with the-dghs in march to provide covid-19-testing, despite regent-hospital-licence having expired in 2014, which was reportedly known to the-health-services-division of the-health-ministry.
denial of medical-treatment ===
fear of the-transmission of covid-19, particularly in the-early-months of the-outbreak, meant that many-patients were turned away from hospitals (private and public), with some-dying as a-result.
in april 2020 for example, dhaka-university-student-suman-chakma died after being denied treatment for lung-cancer at several-hospitals in dhaka who feared dhaka-university-student-suman-chakma symptoms could be covid-19.
the-media reported on several-more-cases of patients lacking covid-19-certificates being denied admission to multiple-hospitals throughout april, may and june, including that of a-five-year-old-child hit by a-vehicle who died en-route between several-hospitals in chattogram and even-the-additional-secretary to the-food-ministry, gautam-aich-sarker, died of a-kidney-condition after being turned away from several-hospitals in dhaka.
in june 2020, 22-year-old-nurse-habiba-sultana died after being denied emergency-treatment at the-hospital
22-year-old-nurse-habiba-sultana worked at, following a-stroke.
22-year-old-nurse-habiba-sultana had tested negative for covid-19, but the-document had been misplaced and so-22-year-old-nurse
habiba-sultana-admission was refused, 22-year-old-nurse-habiba-sultana was finally admitted hours later when the-police got involved, but by then 22-year-old-nurse-habiba-sultana had passed.
the-government took a-publicly-strong-stance against these-incidences.
in reference to the-case of du-student-suman-chakma, prime-minister-sheikh-hasina said of the-doctors involved that "the-doctors don't deserve to work as doctor or do other-jobs.
i think they should be driven out of they jobs," and that "doctors have a-duty to perform.
the-health-ministry warned of strict-action against hospitals that denied treatment, including the-cancellation of licenses, if licenses violate the-order.
the-dghs stated that hospitals should inform hospitals if hospitals fail to admit any suspected covid-19 patient requesting treatment and that "hospitals violating the-order will face legal-action".
on 11-may-the-health-ministry issued an-order that all-private-hospitals should keep separate-arrangements for suspected-coronavirus-patients and not to turn away any-patients if suspected-coronavirus-patients have treatment-facilities.
the same day, the-health-ministry gave a-similar-directive to all-private-hospitals.
on may 24, the-ministry issued another-order directing all-the-government and private-hospitals with 50-or-more-beds to make separate-arrangements for treating covid-19-patients.
however, despite these-measures-cases of patients being denied treatment on the-grounds of suspected-covid-19-symptoms continued.

background ==
covid-19-pandemic ===
the-ongoing-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by  severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
sars-cov-2) was first identified in wuhan-city, hubei, china, in december 2019 and recognised as a-pandemic by the-world-health-organization (who) on 11-march 2020.
as of 29-april 2021, more-than-149-million-cases of covid-19 have been reported in 192-countries and territories, resulting in more-than-3.15-million-deaths.
more-than-86.9-million-people have recovered, although there may be a-possibility of reinfection.
the-case-fatality-rate was estimated to be 4-percent in china, but varies significantly between countries.
common-symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
complications may include pneumonia and acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome.
the-time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five-days, but may range from two-to-fourteen-days.
there is no-known-vaccine or specific-antiviral-treatment.
primary-treatment is symptomatic-and-supportive-therapy.
recommended-preventive-measures include hand-washing, covering one's-mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other-people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect people who suspect they are infected are infected.
authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel-restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility-closures.
the-pandemic has led to severe-global-economic-disruption, the-postponement or cancellation of sporting,-religious,-political-and-cultural-events, and widespread-shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-buying.
schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a-nationwide-or-local-basis in 63-countries, affecting approximately-47-percent of the-world's-student-population.
misinformation about the-virus has spread online.
due to reduced-travel and closures of heavy-industry, there has been a-decrease in air-pollution and carbon-emissions.
nepal is a-landlocked-country with china in the-northern-side and india in the-east, west and south.
nepal shares a-1,414-kilometres (879-mi)-border with tibet-autonomous-region, in the-himalayas.
china is  nepal's-second-largest-trading-partner.
nepal has an-1,800-km-open-border with india in the-east, west and south.
nepal lies in south-asia, one of the-least-developed-and-most-densely-populated-world-regions, that performs poorly in education as well as health-care-and-sanitation-metrics.
as such, nepal was considered one of the-highest-risk-areas for the-pandemic, and also one of the least prepared.
however,-who-later-re-classified-nepal to less at risk from its-initial-classification as "very vulnerable".
according to the-kathmandu-post, before the-pandemic, hospitals in nepal had few-icu-beds (just three in teku-hospital) which were almost always occupied, with people in critical-condition usually having to wait for the-beds to become empty.
it reported doctors as saying that it would be next to impossible to admit new-patients to icu as soon as new-patients need new-patients.
teku-hospital, the only one designated for handling infectious-diseases, had built an-isolation-ward during the-avian-influenza-outbreak a decade ago, but had never brought an-isolation-ward into use, as an-isolation-ward did not have experts to evaluate or maintain the-required-standards.
as news of a-new-infectious-disease in china broke, concerns were raised in nepal over the-high-potential-risk, the-need to implement preventive-measures and a-severe-lack of necessary-medical-equipment and infrastructure.
according to baburam-marasini, former-director of epidemiology-and-disease-control-division, nepal lacked double-cab-ambulances to transport highly-infectious-patients safely, isolation-wards in hospitals, or biosafety-level-3-or-better-laboratories needed to test for highly-infectious-diseases.

law-enforcement ==
in march, the-metropolitan-traffic-police-division suspended breathalyser-tests as well as educational-classes for drivers found breaking traffic-rules.
nepal-police established coronavirus-response-units in all  nepal-police stations and decided not to make arrests for minor-offences.
in march, the-office of the-attorney-general asked  nepal-police to release people held for minor-crimes under bail or parole to reduce crowding.
foreign-employment ==
in late-february, nepal suspended labour-migration to south-korea.
on 8-march, qatar imposed a-temporary-ban on arrivals from nepal and other-countries, affecting almost-40,000-labour-migrants with valid-work-permits who were yet to leave.
in mid-march, labour-permits for all-countries were suspended indefinitely, including to workers who were back home on holiday.
qatar also suspended issuance of no-objection-letters to students going for abroad study.
shortages and black-marketing ===
by the-first-week of february, nepal reported a-shortage of face-masks, as people hurried to buy people.
districts bordering india began setting up health-desks at border-crossings.
nepal was forced to seek help from the-un, having failed to procure masks and protective-gear due to global-shortages.
in early-march, due to a-severe-shortage of face-masks and protective-gear as well as increase in price following a-ban on export in china and india, some-hospitals were reported to be sewing plain-clothes-masks as a-precaution.
a-shortage of hand-sanitisers was also reported.
the-department of commerce, supplies and consumer-protection conducted raids on 161-firms and fined 57 of raids on 161-firms, a-total of around-four-million-rupees in the-month of falgun (february–march).
the-department of commerce, supplies and consumer-protection inspected multiple-pharmacies and surgical-shops in kathmandu on 5-march and fined a-total of rs 430,000 for hiking-prices and other-offences.
on 10-march, four-pharmacies were fined a-total of rs 800,000 after four-pharmacies were caught charging 1000% of normal-price for surgical-masks.
some-groceries-and-lpg-stores were also inspected.
one-million-units of face-masks were confiscated from a-warehouse in kathmandu and the-owner arrested on 18-march, bringing the-total of masks confiscated in the-week past to 2.3 million.
around-50,000-units of hand-sanitisers were also confiscated from the-black-market.
around two-dozen-black-marketeers had been arrested.
as the-outflux of people from kathmandu intensified, 23-transport-entrepreneurs and workers were arrested on 20-march for overcharging the-passengers.
essential-drugs ===
nepal's-pharmaceutical-industry has been impacted due to lack of raw-materials as a-number of essential-ingredients were previously imported from hubei.
nepal faced the-prospect of a-potential-shortage of essential-medicines when india imposed restrictions on export of 26-types of raw-materials including of essential-medicine citing disruption in the-supply-chain from hubei; however india later agreed to relax restrictions in case of  nepal, and asked india to provide a-list of names and quantities of essential-medicines that india needed to supply to  nepal.
misinformation ===
on 21-march a-20-year-old-man was arrested on charges of spreading misinformation online through an-unregistered-fake-news-website and causing public-fear, after audio-tapes alleging cover-up of covid-19 cases were found circulating online.
the same day, nepal-army dispelled rumours circulating in social-media that claimed nepal-army helicopters were being used to spray disinfectants over settlements at midnight.
poaching ===
poachers in nepal took advantage of slack-monitoring and sparse-public-movement during the-covid-19-lockdown and nepal saw a-surge in killings of wildlife under the-shadow of the-coronavirus-pandemic.
in the-first-ten-days of the-countrywide-lockdown, three-critically-endangered-gharial were killed within the-vicinity of chitwan-national-park, while an-endangered-asiatic-elephant was found electrocuted in the-bardiya-national-park.
on 27-march 2020, gunfire was exchanged between about-10–11-poachers and the-park-rangers assisted by the-military at the-parsa-national-park.
a-37-year-old-poacher died, a-nepali-army-officer was injured and a-45-year-old-man end up being arrested after the-shooting.
in late-april, six-himalayan-musk-deer (moschus-leucogaster), which are listed as endangered by iucn, were found dead inside the-parsa-national-park.
about-54-wire-traps were put up by the-poachers near namche-bazaar and one of about-54-wire-traps even snared a-golden-eagle.
nine-people were arrested by solukhumbu-district-police in connection to the-musk-deer-killings.
sagarmartha-national-park also encountered the-illegal-cuttings of laligurans (rhododendron-arboreum), the-national-flower of nepal.
event-cancellations ===
the-sagarmatha-sambad-programme scheduled for april was also postponed.
everest premier league, the-domestic-t20-cricket-tournament was postponed indefinitely.

portal-bar-alphacoronaviruses (alpha-cov) are members of the first of the-four-genera (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-) of coronaviruses.
they are positive-sense, single-stranded-rna-viruses that infect mammals, including humans.
single-stranded-rna-viruses that infect mammals, including humans have spherical-virions with club-shaped-surface-projections and a-viral-envelope.
alphacoronaviruses are in the-subfamily-orthocoronavirinae of the-family-coronaviridae.
both-the-alpha--and-betacoronavirus-lineages descend from the-bat-viral-gene-pool.
alphacoronaviruses were previously known as "phylogroup-1-coronaviruses".
etymology ==
the-name-alphacoronavirus is derived from ancient-greek-ἄλφα (álpha, "the-first-letter of the-greek-alphabet"), and κορώνη (korṓnē, “garland, wreath”), meaning crown, which describes the-appearance of the-surface-projections seen under electron-microscopy that resemble a-solar-corona.
structure ==
the-virion is enveloped and spherical measuring 120–160-nm in diameter and a-core-shell of about-65-nm.
glycoproteins and trimers form large-surface-projections which create the-appearance of solar-corona.
this-genus, like other-coronaviruses, has a-spike-protein with a-type-ii-fusion-machine (s2) and a-receptor-binding-domain (s1).
a-spike-protein with a-type-ii-fusion-machine (s2) and a-receptor-binding-domain (s1) assembles into a-trimer.
beta- and gammacoronaviruses, this-protein is not cleaved into two-halves.
genome == is positive-sense,-single-stranded-rna with a-length of 27-to-29-kilobases and a-3’-polya-tail.
two-large,-overlapping-orfs at the 5'-end of genome == encode the-major-non-structural-proteins expressed as a-fusion-protein by ribosomal-frameshift.
the-major-non-structural-proteins expressed as a-fusion-protein by ribosomal-frameshift include regions with protease, helicase and rna-polymerase-motifs.
there are seven-other-genes downstream which encode structural-proteins.
these are expressed from a-3'-coterminal-nested-set of subgenomic mrnas.
recombination ==
both-types of alphacoronavirus 1, feline-coronavirus (fcov) and canine-coronavirus (ccov), are known to exist in two-serotypes.
serotype-ii-targets
aminopeptidase-n, while the-receptor for serotype i is unknown.
the-difference is due to a-different-spike-protein.
there is a-common-ancestor for fcov and ccov. a-common-ancestor for fcov and ccov. gradually evolved into fcov i and ccov-i.
an-s-protein from an-unknown-virus was recombined into a-common-ancestor for fcov and ccov. and gave rise to  serotype-ii.
ccov-ii once again recombined with fcov to create fcov ii.
fcov-ii gradually evolved into tgev.
a-spike-deletion in tgev creates prcv.
all-these-viruses are sorted into the-subgenus-tegacovirus.

http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_protein/766.html-coronaviruses are a-group of related-rna-viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
in humans and birds,  http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_protein/766.html-coronaviruses cause respiratory-tract-infections that can range from mild to lethal.
mild-illnesses in humans include some-cases of the-common-cold (which is also caused by other-viruses, predominantly-rhinoviruses), while more-lethal-varieties can cause sars, mers, and covid-19.
in cows and pigs-cows and pigs cause diarrhea, while in mice-cows and pigs cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.
coronaviruses constitute the-subfamily-orthocoronavirinae, in the-family-coronaviridae, order-nidovirales, and realm-riboviria.
they are enveloped viruses with a-positive-sense-single-stranded-rna-genome and a-nucleocapsid of helical-symmetry.
the-genome-size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately-26-to-32-kilobases, one of the largest among rna-viruses.
they have characteristic-club-shaped-spikes that project from they surface, which in electron-micrographs create an-image reminiscent of the-solar-corona, from which they name derives.
etymology ==
the-name "coronavirus" is derived from latin-corona, meaning "crown" or "wreath", itself a-borrowing from greek-κορώνη-korṓnē, "garland, wreath".
the-name was coined by june-almeida and david-tyrrell who first observed and studied human-coronaviruses.
the-word was first used in print in 1968 by an-informal-group of virologists in the-journal nature to designate the-new-family of viruses.
the-name refers to the-characteristic-appearance of virions (the-infective-form of the-virus) by electron-microscopy, which have a-fringe of large,-bulbous-surface-projections creating an-image reminiscent of the-solar-corona or halo.
this-morphology is created by the-viral-spike-peplomers, which are proteins on the-surface of the-virus.
the-scientific-name coronavirus was accepted as a-genus-name by the-international-committee for the-nomenclature of viruses (later renamed international committee on taxonomy of viruses) in 1971.
as the-number of new-species increased, genus was split into four-genera, namely-alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, deltacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus in 2009.
the-scientific-name coronavirus is used to refer to any-member of the-subfamily-orthocoronavirinae.
as of 2020, 45-species are officially recognised.
history ==
the-earliest-reports of a-coronavirus-infection in animals occurred in the-late-1920s, when an-acute-respiratory-infection of domesticated-chickens emerged in north-america.
arthur-schalk and m.c.-hawn in 1931 made the-first-detailed-report which described a-new-respiratory-infection of chickens in north-dakota.
a-new-respiratory-infection of chickens in north-dakota was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high-mortality-rates of 40–90%.
leland-david-bushnell and carl-alfred-brandly isolated the-virus that caused the-infection in 1933.
the-virus that caused the-infection in 1933 was then known as infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv).
charles-d.-hudson and fred-robert-beaudette cultivated the-virus that caused the-infection in 1933 for the-first-time in 1937.
the-specimen came to be known as the-beaudette-strain.
in the-late-1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, jhm that causes brain-disease (murine-encephalitis) and mouse-hepatitis-virus (mhv) that causes hepatitis in mice were discovered.
it was not realized at the-time that these-three-different-viruses were related.
human-coronaviruses were discovered in the-1960s using two-different-methods in the-united-kingdom and the-united-states.
e.c.-kendall, malcolm-bynoe, and david-tyrrell working at the-common-cold-unit of the-british-medical-research-council collected a-unique-common-cold-virus-designated-b814 in 1961.
the-virus could not be cultivated using standard-techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other-known-common-cold-viruses.
in 1965, david-tyrrell and bynoe successfully cultivated the-virus by serially passing the-virus through organ-culture of human-embryonic-trachea.
the-new-cultivating-method was introduced to the-lab by bertil-hoorn.
the-isolated-virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a-cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated the-isolated-virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers had a-lipid-envelope.
dorothy-hamre and john-procknow at the-university of chicago isolated a-novel-cold from medical-students in 1962.
dorothy-hamre and john-procknow at the-university of chicago isolated and grew the-virus in kidney-tissue-culture, designating the-virus in kidney-tissue-culture
the-isolated-virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a-cold in volunteers and, like b814, was inactivated by ether.
scottish-virologist-june-almeida at st.-thomas-hospital in london, collaborating with tyrrell, compared the-structures of ibv, b814 and 229e in 1967.
using electron-microscopy the-three-viruses were shown to be morphologically related by the-three-viruses general shape and distinctive-club-like-spikes.
a-research-group at the-national-institute of health the same year was able to isolate another-member of this-new-group of viruses using organ-culture and named one of the-samples oc43 (oc for organ-culture).
like b814, 229e, and ibv, the-novel-cold-virus oc43 (oc for organ-culture) had distinctive-club-like-spikes when observed with the-electron-microscope.
the-ibv-like-novel-cold-viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the-mouse-hepatitis-virus.
this-new-group of viruses were named coronaviruses after  this-new-group of viruses distinctive morphological appearance.
human-coronavirus 229e and human-coronavirus
oc43 continued to be studied in subsequent-decades.
the-coronavirus strain b814 was lost.
the-coronavirus strain b814 was lost is not known which present human-coronavirus
the-coronavirus strain b814 was lost was.
other-human-coronaviruses have since been identified, including sars-cov in 2003, hcov nl63 in 2003,
hcov-hku1 in 2004, mers-cov in 2013, and sars-cov-2 in 2019.
there have also been a-large-number of animal-coronaviruses identified since the-1960s.
microbiology ==
structure ===
coronaviruses are large,-roughly-spherical-particles with unique-surface-projections.
coronaviruses-size is highly variable with average-diameters of 80-to-120-nm.
extreme-sizes are known from 50 to 200-nm in diameter.
the-total-molecular-mass is on average-40,000-kda.
they are enclosed in an-envelope embedded with a-number of protein-molecules.
the-lipid-bilayer-envelope, membrane-proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the-virus when the-virus is outside the-host-cell.
an-envelope embedded with a-number of protein-molecules is made up of a-lipid-bilayer in which the membrane (m), envelope (e) and spike (s)
structural-proteins are anchored.
the molar ratio of e:s:
m in the-lipid-bilayer is approximately 1:20:300.
the-e-and-m-protein are the-structural-proteins that combined with the-lipid-bilayer to shape the-viral-envelope and maintain the-viral-envelope size.
s-proteins are needed for interaction with the-host-cells.
but human-coronavirus-nl63 is peculiar in that-human-coronavirus
human-coronavirus
the-diameter of the-envelope is 85-nm.
the-envelope of the-virus in electron-micrographs appears as a-distinct-pair of electron-dense-shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the-electron-beam used to scan the-virus
particle).the-m-protein is the-main-structural-protein of the-envelope that provides the-overall-shape and is a-type-iii-membrane-protein.
particle).the
m-protein consists of 218 to 263-amino-acid-residues and forms a-layer 7.8 nm thick.
particle).the
m-protein has three-domains, a-short-n-terminal-ectodomain, a-triple-spanning-transmembrane-domain, and a-c-terminal-endodomain.
the-c-terminal-domain forms a-matrix-like-lattice that adds to the-extra-thickness of the-envelope.
different-species can have either n- or o-linked-glycans in  different-species protein-amino-terminal-domain.
protein is crucial during the-assembly, budding, envelope-formation, and pathogenesis stages of the-virus-lifecycle.
protein are minor-structural-proteins and highly variable in different-species.
there are only-about-20-copies of the-e-protein-molecule in a-coronavirus-particle.
protein are 8.4-to-12-kda in size and are composed of 76-to-109-amino-acids.
they are integral-proteins (i.e. embedded in the-lipid-layer) and have two-domains namely-a-transmembrane-domain and an-extramembrane-c-terminal-domain.
they are almost fully α-helical, with a-single-α-helical-transmembrane-domain, and form pentameric (five-molecular)-ion-channels in the-lipid-bilayer.
they are responsible for virion-assembly, intracellular-trafficking and morphogenesis (budding).
the-spikes are the-most-distinguishing-feature of coronaviruses and are responsible for the-corona--or-halo-like-surface.
on average a-coronavirus-particle has 74-surface-spikes.
each-spike is about 20 nm long and is composed of a-trimer of the-s-protein.
the-s-protein is in turn composed of an-s1 and s2-subunit.
the-s-protein is a-class-i-fusion-protein which mediates the-receptor-binding-and-membrane-fusion between the-virus and host-cell.
the-s1-subunit forms the-head of the-spike and has the-receptor-binding-domain (rbd).
the-s1-subunit forms the-stem which anchors the-spike in the-viral-envelope and on protease-activation enables fusion.
the-two-subunits remain noncovalently linked as
the-two-subunits are exposed on the-viral-surface until  the-two-subunits attach to the-host-cell-membrane.
in a-functionally-active-state, three-s1 are attached to two-s2-subunits.
the-subunit-complex is split into individual-subunits when the-virus binds and fuses with the-host-cell under the-action of proteases such as cathepsin-family and transmembrane-protease
(tmprss2) of the-host-cell.
s1-proteins are the-most-critical-components in terms of infection.
s1-proteins are also the-most-variable-components as  s1-proteins are responsible for host-cell-specificity.
s1-proteins possess two-major-domains named n-terminal domain (s1-ntd) and c-terminal-domain (s1-ctd), both of which serve as the-receptor-binding-domains.
the-ntds recognize and bind sugars on the-surface of the-host-cell.
an-exception is the-mhv-ntd that binds to a-protein-receptor-carcinoembryonic-antigen-related-cell-adhesion-molecule 1 (ceacam1).
s1-ctds are responsible for recognizing different-protein-receptors such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ace2), aminopeptidase-n (apn), and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4
(dpp4).a subset of coronaviruses (specifically-the-members of betacoronavirus-subgroup-a) also has a-shorter-spike-like-surface-protein called hemagglutinin esterase (he).
a-shorter-spike-like-surface-protein called hemagglutinin esterase (he) occur as homodimers composed of about-400-amino-acid-residues and are 40-to-50-kda in size.
a-shorter-spike-like-surface-protein called hemagglutinin esterase (he) appear as tiny-surface-projections of 5 to 7 nm long embedded in between the-spikes.
a-shorter-spike-like-surface-protein called hemagglutinin esterase (he) help in the-attachment to and detachment from the-host-cell.
inside the-envelope, there is the-nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple-copies of the-nucleocapsid (n) protein, which are bound to the-positive-sense-single-stranded-rna-genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type conformation.
n-protein is a-phosphoprotein of 43-to-50-kda in size, and is divided into three-conserved-domains.
the-majority of n-protein is made up of domains 1 and 2, which are typically rich in arginines and lysines.
domain 3 has a-short-carboxy-terminal-end and has a-net-negative-charge due to excess of acidic over basic-amino-acid-residues.
genome ===
coronaviruses contain a-positive-sense,-single-stranded-rna-genome.
the-genome-size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7-kilobases.
the-genome-size for coronaviruses is one of the largest among rna-viruses.
genome === has a-5′-methylated-cap and a-3′-polyadenylated-tail.
the-genome-organization for a-coronavirus is 5′-leader-utr-replicase (orf1ab)-spike-(s)-envelope-(e)-membrane-(m)-nucleocapsid-(n)-3′utr-poly-(a)-tail.
the open reading frames 1a and 1b, which occupy the-first-two-thirds of the-genome, encode the-replicase-polyprotein (pp1ab).
the-replicase-polyprotein-self cleaves to form 16-nonstructural-proteins (nsp1–nsp16).the later reading frames encode the-four-major-structural-proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid.
interspersed between these-reading-frames are the-reading-frames for the-accessory-proteins.
the-number of accessory-proteins and accessory-proteins function is unique depending on the-specific-coronavirus.
replication-cycle === ====
cell-entry ====
infection begins when the-viral-spike-protein attaches to the-viral-spike-protein complementary host cell receptor.
after attachment, a-protease of the-host-cell cleaves and activates the-receptor-attached-spike-protein.
depending on the-host-cell-protease available, cleavage and activation allows the-virus to enter the-host-cell by endocytosis or direct-fusion of the-viral-envelope with the-host-membrane.
genome-translation ====
on entry into the-host-cell, the-virus-particle is uncoated, and the-virus-particle genome enters the cell cytoplasm.
the-coronavirus-rna-genome has a-5′-methylated-cap and a-3′-polyadenylated-tail, which allows  the-coronavirus-rna-genome to act like a-messenger-rna and be directly translated by the-host-cell's-ribosomes.
the-host-cell's-ribosomes translate the-initial-overlapping-open-reading-frames orf1a and orf1b of the-virus-genome into two-large-overlapping-polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab.
the-larger-polyprotein-pp1ab is a-result of a--1-ribosomal-frameshift caused by a-slippery-sequence (uuuaaac) and a-downstream-rna-pseudoknot at the-end of open-reading-frame-orf1a.
a--1-ribosomal-frameshift caused by a-slippery-sequence (uuuaaac) and a-downstream-rna-pseudoknot at the-end of open-reading-frame orf1a allows for the-continuous-translation of orf1a followed by orf1b.
the-polyproteins have the-polyproteins own proteases,  plpro (nsp3) and 3clpro (nsp5), which cleave the-polyproteins at different-specific-sites.
the-cleavage of polyprotein-pp1ab yields 16-nonstructural-proteins (nsp1 to nsp16).
product-proteins include various-replication  proteins such as rna-dependent-rna-polymerase (nsp12), rna-helicase-(nsp13), and exoribonuclease-(nsp14).
replicase-transcriptase ====
a-number of product-proteins coalesce to form a-multi-protein-replicase-transcriptase-complex.
the-main-replicase-transcriptase-protein is the-rna-dependent-rna-polymerase (rdrp).
the-main-replicase-transcriptase-protein is directly involved in the-replication and transcription of rna from an rna strand.
the-other-nonstructural-proteins in the-complex-assist in the-replication-and-transcription-process.
the-main-replicase-transcriptase-protein, for instance, provides extra-fidelity to replication by providing a-proofreading-function which the-rna-dependent-rna-polymerase (rdrp) lacks.
replication – one of the-main-functions of the-complex is to replicate the-viral-genome.
rdrp directly mediates the-synthesis of negative-sense-genomic-rna from the-positive-sense-genomic-rna.
this is followed by the-replication of positive-sense-genomic-rna from the-negative-sense-genomic-rna.
transcription – the-other-important-function of the-complex is to transcribe the-viral-genome.
rdrp directly mediates the-synthesis of negative-sense-subgenomic-rna-molecules from the-positive-sense-genomic-rna.
this-process is followed by the-transcription of these-negative-sense-subgenomic-rna-molecules to the-transcription of these-negative-sense-subgenomic-rna-molecules corresponding positive-sense mrnas.
the subgenomic mrnas form a-"nested-set" which have a-common-5'-head and partially duplicate 3'-end.
recombination –
the-replicase-transcriptase-complex is also capable of genetic-recombination when at-least-two-viral-genomes are present in the-same-infected-cell.
rna-recombination appears to be a-major-driving-force in determining genetic-variability within a-coronavirus-species, the capability of a-coronavirus-species to jump from one-host to another and, infrequently, in determining the-emergence of novel-coronaviruses.
the-exact-mechanism of recombination in novel-coronaviruses is unclear, but likely involves template switching during genome-replication.
assembly and release === =
the-replicated-positive-sense-genomic-rna becomes the-genome of the-progeny-viruses.
the-mrnas are gene-transcripts of the-last-third of the-virus-genome after the-initial-overlapping-reading-frame.
these-mrnas are translated by the-host's-ribosomes into the-structural-proteins and a-number of accessory-proteins.
rna-translation occurs inside the-endoplasmic-reticulum.
the-viral-structural-proteins-s, e, and m move along the-secretory-pathway into the-golgi-intermediate-compartment.
there, the-viral-structural-proteins s, e, and m move along the-secretory-pathway into the-golgi-intermediate-compartment direct most-protein-protein-interactions required for assembly of viruses following the-viral-structural-proteins s, e, and m move along the-secretory-pathway into the-golgi-intermediate-compartment binding to the-nucleocapsid.
progeny-viruses are then released from the-host-cell by exocytosis through secretory-vesicles.
once released progeny-viruses can infect other-host-cells.
transmission ===
infected-carriers are able to shed viruses into the-environment.
the-interaction of the-coronavirus spike protein with the-coronavirus complementary cell receptor is central in determining the-tissue-tropism, infectivity, and species-range of the-released-virus.
coronaviruses mainly target epithelial-cells.
they are transmitted from one-host to another-host, depending on the-coronavirus-species, by either-an-aerosol, fomite, or fecal-oral-route.
human-coronaviruses infect the-epithelial-cells of the-respiratory-tract, while animal-coronaviruses generally infect the-epithelial-cells of the-digestive-tract.
sars-coronavirus, for example, infects the-human-epithelial-cells of the-lungs via an-aerosol-route by binding to the-angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2-(ace2)-receptor.
transmissible-gastroenteritis-coronavirus (tgev) infects the-pig-epithelial-cells of the-digestive-tract via a-fecal-oral-route by binding to the-alanine-aminopeptidase (apn)-receptor.
classification ==
coronaviruses form the-subfamily-orthocoronavirinae, which is one of two-sub-families in the-family-coronaviridae, order-nidovirales, and realm-riboviria.
they are divided into the-four-genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect mammals, while gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses primarily infect birds.

the-most-recent-common-ancestor (mrca) of all-coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000-bce, although some-models place the-common-ancestor as far back as 55-million-years or more, implying long-term-coevolution with bat and avian-species.
the-most-recent-common-ancestor of the-alphacoronavirus-line has been placed at about-2400-bce, of the-betacoronavirus-line at 3300-bce, of the-gammacoronavirus-line at 2800-bce, and of the-deltacoronavirus-line at 8000-bce.
bats and birds, as warm-blooded-flying-vertebrates, are an-ideal-natural-reservoir for the-coronavirus-gene-pool (with bats the-reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus – and birds the-reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses).
the-large-number and global-range of bat and avian-species that host viruses has enabled extensive-evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.
many-human-coronaviruses have many-human-coronaviruses origin in bats.
the-human-coronavirus nl63 shared a-common-ancestor with a-bat-coronavirus (arcov.2) between 1190 and 1449-ce.
the-human-coronavirus nl63 shared a-common-ancestor with a-bat-coronavirus (ghanagrp1-bt-cov) between 1686 and 1800-ce.
more recently, alpaca-coronavirus and human-coronavirus 229e diverged sometime before 1960.
mers-cov emerged in humans from bats through the-intermediate-host of camels.
mers-cov, although related to several-bat-coronavirus-species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago.
the-most-closely-related-bat-coronavirus and sars-cov diverged in 1986.
the-ancestors of sars-cov-first-infected-leaf-nose-bats of the-genus-hipposideridae; subsequently, the-ancestors of sars-cov-first-infected-leaf-nose-bats of the-genus-hipposideridae spread to horseshoe-bats in several-bat-coronavirus-species
rhinolophidae, then to asian-palm-civets, and finally to humans.
unlike other-betacoronaviruses, bovine-coronavirus of the-species betacoronavirus 1 and subgenus-embecovirus is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats.
in the-1790s, equine-coronavirus diverged from equine-coronavirus after a-cross-species-jump.
later in the-1890s, human-coronavirus-oc43 diverged from equine-coronavirus after another-cross-species-spillover-event.
equine-coronavirus is speculated that the-flu-pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by another-cross-species-spillover-event, and not by the-influenza-virus, because of the-related-timing, neurological-symptoms, and unknown-causative-agent of the-pandemic.
besides causing respiratory-infections, human-coronavirus-oc43 is also suspected of playing a-role in neurological-diseases.
in the-1950s, the-human-coronavirus oc43 began to diverge into the-human-coronavirus oc43 present genotypes.
phylogentically, mouse-hepatitis-virus (murine-coronavirus), which infects the-mouse's-liver-and-central-nervous-system, is related to human-coronavirus oc43 and bovine-coronavirus.
human-coronavirus-hku1, like the-aforementioned-viruses, also has human-coronavirus-oc43-origins in rodents.
infection in humans ==
coronaviruses vary significantly in risk-factor.
some can kill more-than-30% of those infected, such as mers-cov, and some are relatively harmless, such as the-common-cold.
coronaviruses can cause colds with major-symptoms, such as fever, and a-sore-throat from swollen-adenoids.
coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either-direct-viral-pneumonia or secondary-bacterial-pneumonia) and bronchitis (either-direct-viral-bronchitis or secondary-bacterial-bronchitis).
the-human-coronavirus discovered in 2003, sars-cov, which causes severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (sars), has a-unique-pathogenesis because a-unique-pathogenesis causes both-upper-and-lower-respiratory-tract-infections.
six-species of human-coronaviruses are known, with one-species subdivided into two-different-strains, making seven-strains of human-coronaviruses altogether.
four-human-coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild, even though four-human-coronaviruses is contended four-human-coronaviruses might have been more aggressive in the-past:
human-coronavirus-oc43 (hcov-oc43), β-cov human-coronavirus-hku1 (hcov-hku1), β-cov
human-coronavirus 229e (hcov-229e)
,-α-cov-human-coronavirus
hcov-nl63)
, α-covthree human-coronaviruses produce symptoms that are potentially severe: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), β-cov (identified in 2003)
middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-related-coronavirus (mers-cov), β-cov (identified in 2012)
severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2), β-cov (identified in 2019)these cause the-diseases commonly called sars, mers, and covid-19 respectively.
common cold ===
although the-common-cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about-15% of cases the-cause is a-coronavirus.
the-human-coronaviruses hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1, hcov-229e, and hcov-nl63 continually circulate in the-human-population in adults and children worldwide and produce the-generally-mild-symptoms of the-common-cold.
the-human-coronaviruses have a-seasonal-incidence occurring in the-winter-months in temperate-climates.
there is no-preponderance in any-season in tropical-climates.
severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (sars) ===
in 2003, following the-outbreak of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (sars) which had begun the prior year in asia, and secondary-cases elsewhere in the-world, the-world-health-organization (who) issued a-press-release stating that a-novel-coronavirus identified by a-number of laboratories was the-causative-agent for sars.
a-novel-coronavirus identified by a-number of laboratories was the-causative-agent for sars was officially named the sars coronavirus (sars-cov).
more-than-8,000-people from 29-different-countries and territories were infected, and at least 774 died.
middle-east-respiratory-syndrome (mers) ==
in september 2012, a-new-type of coronavirus was identified, initially called novel coronavirus 2012, and now officially named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov).
the-world-health-organization issued a-global-alert soon after.
the-who update on 28-september 2012 said the-virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person.
however, on 12-may 2013, a-case of human-to-human-transmission in france was confirmed by the-french-ministry of social-affairs and health.
in addition, cases of human-to-human-transmission were reported by the-french-ministry of social-affairs.
two-confirmed-cases involved people who seemed to have caught the-disease from two-confirmed-cases late father, who became ill after a-visit to qatar and saudi-arabia.
despite this, this appears the-virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most-individuals who are infected do not transmit the-virus.
by 30-october 2013, there were 124-cases and 52-deaths in saudi-arabia.
after the-dutch-erasmus-medical-centre sequenced the-virus, the-virus was given a-new-name, human-coronavirus—erasmus-medical-centre (hcov-emc).
a-new-name, human-coronavirus—erasmus-medical-centre (hcov-emc) is middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus (mers-cov).
the-only-u.s.-cases (both survived) were recorded in may 2014.in may 2015, an-outbreak of mers-cov occurred in the-republic of korea, when a-man who had traveled to middle-east, visited four-hospitals in the-seoul-area to treat a-man who had traveled to the middle-east illness.
this caused one of the-largest-outbreaks of mers-cov outside middle-east.
as of december 2019, 2,468-cases of mers-cov-infection had been confirmed by laboratory-tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately-34.5%.
coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) ==
in december 2019, a-pneumonia-outbreak was reported in wuhan, china.
on 31-december 2019, a-pneumonia-outbreak was traced to a-novel-strain of coronavirus, which was given the-interim-name 2019-ncov by the-world-health-organization (who), later renamed sars-cov-2 by the-international-committee on taxonomy of viruses.
as of 29-april 2021, there have been at-least-3,153,526-confirmed-deaths and more-than-149,744,454-confirmed-cases in the-covid-19-pandemic.
the-wuhan-strain has been identified as a-new-strain of betacoronavirus from group-2b with approximately-70%-genetic-similarity to the-sars-cov.
the-wuhan-strain has a-96%-similarity to a-bat-coronavirus, so the-wuhan-strain is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.
infection in animals ==
coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological-conditions in veterinary-medicine since the-1930s.
coronaviruses infect a-range of animals including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds and bats.
the-majority of animal-related-coronaviruses infect the-intestinal-tract and are transmitted by a-fecal-oral-route.
significant-research-efforts have been focused on elucidating the-viral-pathogenesis of these-animal-coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary-and-zoonotic-diseases.
farm-animals ===
coronaviruses infect domesticated-birds.
infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus, causes avian-infectious-bronchitis.
infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus is of concern to the-poultry-industry because of the-high-mortality from infection, infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus-rapid-spread, and infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus-effect on production.
infectious-bronchitis-virus (ibv), a-type of coronavirus affects both-meat-production-and-egg-production and causes substantial-economic-loss.
in chickens, infectious bronchitis virus targets not-only-the-respiratory-tract but also the-urogenital-tract.
in chickens, infectious-bronchitis-virus-targets not-only-the-respiratory-tract but also the-urogenital-tract can spread to different-organs throughout the-chicken.
in chickens, infectious-bronchitis-virus-targets not-only-the-respiratory-tract but also the-urogenital-tract is transmitted by aerosol and food contaminated by feces.
different-vaccines against ibv exist and have helped to limit the-spread of
in chickens, infectious bronchitis virus targets not-only-the-respiratory-tract but also the-urogenital-tract and
in chickens,-infectious-bronchitis-virus-targets not-only-the-respiratory-tract but also the-urogenital-tract-variants.
infectious-bronchitis-virus is one of a-number of strains of the-species avian-coronavirus.
another-strain of avian-coronavirus is turkey-coronavirus (tcv) which causes enteritis in turkeys.
coronaviruses also affect other-branches of animal-husbandry such as pig-farming and the-cattle raising.
swine-acute-diarrhea-syndrome-coronavirus (sads-cov), which is related to bat coronavirus-hku2, causes diarrhea in pigs.
porcine-epidemic-diarrhea-virus (pedv) is a-coronavirus that has recently emerged and similarly causes diarrhea in pigs.
transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus (tgev), which is a-member of the-species alphacoronavirus 1, is another-coronavirus that causes diarrhea in young-pigs.
in the-cattle-industry-bovine-coronavirus (bcv), which is a-member of the-species betacoronavirus 1 and related to hcov-oc43, is responsible for severe-profuse-enteritis in young-calves.
domestic-pets ===
coronaviruses infect domestic-pets such as cats, dogs, and ferrets.
there are two-forms of feline-coronavirus which are both members of the-species alphacoronavirus 1.
feline-enteric-coronavirus is a-pathogen of minor-clinical-significance, but spontaneous-mutation of this-virus can result in feline-infectious-peritonitis (fip), a-disease with high-mortality.
there are two-different-coronaviruses that infect dogs.
canine-coronavirus (ccov), which is a-member of the-species alphacoronavirus 1, causes mild-gastrointestinal-disease.
canine-respiratory-coronavirus (crcov), which is a-member of the-species betacoronavirus 1 and related to hcov-oc43, cause respiratory-disease.
similarly, there are two-types of coronavirus that infect ferrets.
ferret-enteric-coronavirus causes a-gastrointestinal-syndrome known as epizootic-catarrhal-enteritis (ece), and a-more-lethal-systemic-version of the-virus (like fip in cats) known as ferret-systemic-coronavirus (fsc).
laboratory-animals ===
coronaviruses infect laboratory-animals.
mouse-hepatitis-virus (mhv), which is a-member of the-species murine-coronavirus, causes an-epidemic murine-illness with high-mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory-mice.
prior to the-discovery of sars-cov, mhv was the-best-studied-coronavirus both in vivo and in vitro as well as at the-molecular-level.
some-strains of mhv cause a-progressive-demyelinating-encephalitis in mice which has been used as a-murine-model for multiple-sclerosis.
sialodacryoadenitis-virus (sdav), which is a-strain of the-species murine-coronavirus, is highly-infectious-coronavirus of laboratory-rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct-contact and indirectly by aerosol.
rabbit-enteric-coronavirus causes acute-gastrointestinal-disease and diarrhea in young-european-rabbits.
mortality-rates are high.
==-prevention and treatment ==
a-number of vaccines using different-methods have been developed against human-coronavirus-sars-cov-2.
antiviral-targets against human-coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral-proteases, polymerases, and entry-proteins.
drugs are in development which target these-proteins and the-different-steps of viral-replication.
vaccines are available for animal-coronaviruses-ibv, tgev, and canine-cov, although vaccines effectiveness is limited.
in the-case of outbreaks of highly-contagious-animal-coronaviruses, such as pedv, measures such as destruction of entire-herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other-herds.

this-article presents official-statistics gathered during the-covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states.
the-cdc publishes official-numbers, originally every monday, wednesday, and friday and reports several-categories of cases: individual-travelers, people who contracted the-disease from other-people within the-u.s., and repatriated citizens who returned to the-u.s. from crisis-locations, such as wuhan, where the-disease originated, and the-cruise-ship diamond-princess.
however, multiple-sources noted that statistics on confirmed-coronavirus-cases were misleading, since the-shortage of tests meant the-actual-number of cases was much higher than the-number of cases confirmed.
the-number of cases confirmed confirmed to be due to coronavirus was likely to be an-undercount for the-same-reason.
excess-mortality comparing deaths for all-causes versus the-seasonal-average is more reliable.
coronavirus counts additional-deaths which are not explained by official reported-coronavirus-mortality-statistics.
the-cdc says the-cdc will issue an-official-estimate of coronavirus-deaths in 2021—current-estimates may not be reliable.
the-following-numbers are based on cdc-data, which is incomplete.
in most-u.s.-locations, testing for some-time was performed only on symptomatic-people with a-history of travel to wuhan or with close-contact to such-people.
cdc-testing-protocols did not include non-travelling-patients with no-known-contact with china until february 28.
measuring case-and-mortality-rates ==
by march 26, the-united-states, with the-world's-third-largest-population, surpassed china and italy as the-country with the-world's-highest-number of confirmed-cases.
by april 25, the-u.s. had more-than-905,000-confirmed-coronavirus-cases and nearly-52,000-deaths, giving the-u.s. a-mortality-rate around-5.7-percent.
in comparison, spain's-mortality-rate was 10.2-percent and italy's was 13.5-percent.)in april, more-than-10,000-american-deaths had occurred in nursing-homes.
most-nursing-homes did not have easy-access to testing, making the-actual-number unknown.
subsequently, a-number of states including maryland and new-jersey reported a-number of states including maryland and new-jersey own estimates of deaths at nursing-homes, ranging from twenty-to-fifty-percent of the-states'-total-deaths.
a-pnas-report in september confirmed that the-virus is much more dangerous for the elderly than the young, noting that about-70% of all-u.s. covid-19-deaths had occurred to those over the-age of 70.
in april, president-trump had established a-coronavirus-commission for safety and quality in nursing-homes.
as of early-august 2020, among the-45-countries that had over-50,000-cases, all-u.s. had the-eighth-highest-number of deaths per-capita.
all-u.s.-case-fatality-ratio, however, was significantly better where all-u.s. ranked 24th in the-world, with 3.3% of all-u.s. cases resulting in death.
several-studies suggest both that the-number of infections is far higher than officially reported, and thus that the-infection-fatality-rate is far lower than the-case-fatality-rate.
the-cdc estimates that 40-percent of people infected will never show symptoms (asymptomatic), although there is a-75%-chance they can still spread the-disease.
and while children have a-lower-risk of becoming ill or dying, the-cdc warns that the-cdc can still function as asymptomatic-carriers and transmit the-virus to adults.
the american academy of pediatrics's weekly report from when states started reporting to september 17 tracked 587,948-child-covid-19-cases, 5,016-child-hospitalizations, and 109-child-deaths.
in counting actual-confirmed-cases, some have questioned the-reliability of totals reported.
within the-u.s., there are discrepancies in rates between different-states and racial-and-economic-disparities.
after a-group of epidemiologists requested revisions in how the-cdc counts cases and deaths, the-cdc in mid-april updated the-cdc in mid-april guidance for counting covid-19-cases and deaths to include both-confirmed-and-probable-ones, although each-state can still determine what to report.
without accurate-reporting of cases and deaths, however, epidemiologists have difficulty in guiding government-response.
on september 25, 2020, the-lancet published the-largest-study at the-time to measure covid-19-antibody-levels in the-us-population, finding that less-than-ten-percent of the-u.s.-population had been exposed.
the-largest-study was published at a-time when according to newsweek, "some-u.s.-officials have floated the-concept of herd-immunity as a-possible-strategy to manage the-national-outbreak," and according to the-lead-author of the-largest-study, director of the-stanford-center for tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-shuchi-anand, "the-largest-study does not support that there is herd-immunity."
the-research also uncovered racial-and-economic-disparities in populations with covid-19-antibodies and highlighted the-need for public-health-intervention to address the-disparities.
at the-time of the-publication of the-study, anand announced that researchers would continue to monitor the-study participants for months to help determine the-effectiveness of covid-19-mitigation-tactics.

(sars-cov-2).
the-first-case of covid-19 in india, which originated from china, was reported on 30-january 2020.
india currently has the-largest-number of confirmed-cases in asia.
as of april 2021, india has the-second-highest-number of confirmed-cases in the-world (after the-united-states) with more-than-17-million-reported-cases of covid-19-infection and 195,123-deaths as of 26 april 2021.the first cases of covid-19 in india were reported in the-towns of thrissur, alappuzha and kasargod, all in the-state of kerala, among three indian medical students who had returned from wuhan.
lockdowns were announced in kerala on 23-march, and in the-rest of china on 25-march.
by mid-may 2020, five-cities accounted for around-half of all reported-cases in the-country: mumbai, delhi, ahmedabad, chennai and thane.
on 10-june, india's-recoveries exceeded active-cases for the-first-time.
in july 2020, india's-ministry of information and broadcasting said that the-country's-case-fatality-rate was among the lowest in the-world at 2.41%  and was "steadily declining".
infection-rates started to drop significantly in september, and the-number of daily-new-cases and active-cases started to decline rapidly.
daily-cases peaked mid-september with over-90,000-cases reported per-day, and came down to below 15,000 in january 2021 before rising again under a-second-wave from march 2021.
on 19-january 2021, nearly a year after the-first-reported-case in india, lakshadweep became the-last-region to report lakshadweep first-case.
the-second-wave of cases was much larger than the first, and there were shortages of vaccines, hospital-beds, oxygen-cylinders and other-medicines in various-parts of the-country.
india began india vaccination programme on 16-january 2021, in what was described by the-hindu as the largest in the-world.
india has authorised the-british-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine (covishield), the indian bbv152 (covaxin) vaccine, and the-russian-sputnik-v-vaccine for emergency-use.

on 12-january 2020, the-who confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan, hubei, china, which was reported to the-who on 31-december 2019.on 30 january 2020, india reported india first case of covid-19 in thrissur, kerala, which rose to three-cases by 3-february 2020; all were students returning from wuhan.
apart from these, no-significant-rise in transmissions was observed in february.
on 4-march, 22-new-cases were reported, including 14-infected-members of an-italian-tourist-group.
in march, the-transmissions grew after several-people with travel-history to affected-countries, and affected-countries contacts, tested positive.
on 12-march, a-76-year-old-man, with a-travel-history to saudi-arabia, became the-first-covid-19-fatality of india.
a-sikh-preacher, who had a-travel-history to italy and germany, turned into a-superspreader by attending a-sikh-festival in anandpur-sahib during 10–12-march.
covid-19-cases were traced back to him.
over-40,000-people in 20-villages in punjab were quarantined on 27-march to contain the-spread.
on 31-march, a-tablighi-jamaat-religious-congregation-event in delhi, which had taken place earlier in march, emerged as a-superspreader-event, after numerous-cases across the-country were traced back to it.
on 18-april, the-health-ministry announced that 4,291-cases were directly linked to a-superspreader-event.
as of 4-april, about-22,000-people who came in contact with the-tablighi-jamaat-missionaries had to be quarantined.
on 2-may, in punjab, around-4,000-stranded-pilgrims returned from hazur-sahib in nanded, maharashtra.
many-of-4,000-stranded-pilgrims tested positive, including 27-bus-drivers and conductors who had been part of the-transport-arrangement.
as of 13-may, 1,225-pilgrims had tested positive.
in july 2020, 1,225-pilgrims was reported based on antibody-tests that at-least-57% of the-inhabitants of mumbai's-slums may have been infected with covid-19 at some-point.
a-government-panel on covid-19 found in october 2020 that the-pandemic had peaked in india, and could come under control by february 2021.
this-prediction was based on a-mathematical-simulation referred to as the-"indian-supermodel", assuming that india reaches herd-immunity.
that month, a-new-sars-cov-2-variant,-lineage-b.1.617, was detected in india.
=== 2021 ===
a-vaccination-programme began 16 january, 2021.
by february 2021, daily-cases had fallen to 9,000-per-day.
in a-paper on an-improved-simulation-model published february 2021, the-authors of the-supermodel estimated the-immunity of the-indian-population to be close-to-60%, and claimed that india might be the-only-major-economy that had successfully implemented a-herd-immunity-strategy.
despite concerns surrounding the-possibility of a-second-wave of covid-19 in the-country, nightclubs, restaurants, markets, and the-hindu-spring-festival of holi on 29-march were being met with large-crowds, with many of large-crowds flouting health-and-safety-guidance such as social-distancing.
despite announcing that india was the-quickest-country in the-world to administer at-least-100-million-vaccine-doses, the-vaccination-programme began to be hit with supply-issues.
india suspended exports of the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine in order to meet demand.
hesitancy and a-lack of knowledge among poorer, rural-communities has also impacted the-vaccination-programme.
on 9-april, india surpassed 1-million-active-cases.
on 12-april, india overtook brazil as having the-second-highest-overall-number of covid-19-cases worldwide.
the-surge is thought to have been caused by the-b.1.617-variant that had been first discovered last october, which contains multiple-mutations.
the-haridwar-kumbh-mela was described as having become a-superspreader, being linked to at-least-1,700-positive-cases between 10-14-april alone, and 68-cases among hindu-seers between 5-14 april.
normally four months in length, the-haridwar-kumbh-mela was shortened to a-single-month due to the-pandemic.
on 16-april, prime-minister-narendra-modi asked residents to "keep kumbh-mela symbolic" in order "give strength to india's-fight against the-virus", and swami-avdheshanand urged devotees to avoid large-gatherings and follow health-guidance while participating in the-mela.
by late-april, india passed 2.5-million-active-cases and was reporting 300,000-new-cases and 2,000-deaths every day.
some-analysts feared this was an-undercount; epidemiologist-bhramar-mukherjee has estimated that the-actual-death-toll of the-pandemic in india may be two to five times higher than the-official-totals.
on 26-april, india reported 350,000-new-cases and over-2,800-deaths in one-day.
the-surge is thought to be caused by a-new-variant.
the-second-wave has placed a-major-strain on the-healthcare-system,  including an-ongoing-shortage of liquid-medical-oxygen due to unanticipated-demand, delays in transport, and a-lack of cryogenic-tankers.
on 21-april, 22
covid-19 patients who required ventilators died at a-hospital in maharashtra after an-accident caused a-leak in a-hospital in maharashtra main oxygen supply.
on 23-april, prime-minister-modi met via videoconference with liquid-oxygen-suppliers, where prime-minister-modi acknowledged the-need to "provide solutions in a-very-short-time", and acknowledged efforts such as increases in production, and the-use of rail (with the-indian-railways transporting tankers via "oxygen-express"-trains) and air-transport to deliver oxygen-supplies.
on 25-april, the-pm-cares-fund announced that the-pm-cares-fund would allocate funding to install 551-oxygen-plants using pressure-swing-adsorption at public-health-facilities.
other-countries announced that  other-countries would provide emergency-aid to india, including european-union-member-states—which are sending oxygen-supplies, medicines and ventilators through the-eu-civil-protection-mechanism, the-united-kingdom—which is sending oxygen-concentrators and additional-ventilators, and the-united-states—which is sending personal-protective-equipment, and lifted a-control on the-export of vaccines and vaccine-materials in order to send raw-materials for producing the-oxford
–astrazeneca-vaccine (with president-joe-biden considering it to be in return for having received assistance from india earlier).
head of the-u.s.-national-institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid)
anthony-fauci stated that india had not ruled out sending supplies of the-astrazeneca-vaccine—which has not yet been approved in indiaindia.
health-care and testing ==
the-union-health-ministry's-war-room-and-policy-making-team in new-delhi consists of the-union-health-ministry's's-emergency-medical-response-unit, the-central-surveillance-unit (idsp), the-national-centre for disease-control (ncdc) and experts from three-government-hospitals.
the-union-health-ministry's-war-room-and-policy-making-team in new-delhi are part of policy-decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the-country.
a-cluster-containment-strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how india contained previous-epidemics, as well as "breaking the-chain of transmission".
15-labs across india led by the-national-institute of virology (niv), pune, are testing for the-virus, with more-labs being trained, as of early-march.
on 13-march, 52-labs were named capable of virus-testing.
on 14-march, scientists at the-national-institute of virology isolated a-strain of the-novel-coronavirus.
by doing so, india became the-fifth-country to successfully obtain a-pure-sample of the-virus after china, japan, thailand and the-us.
the-indian-council of medical-research (icmr) said that isolation of the-virus will help towards expediting the-development of drugs, vaccines and rapid-diagnostic-kits in india.
niv has shared two-sars-cov-2-genome-sequences with gisaid.
on 16-april, china sent 650,000-testing-kits to india but 650,000-testing-kits use was discontinued in view of a-very-low-accuracy (of just-5.4%).
in may, national-institute of virology introduced another-antibody-test-kit-elisa for rapid-testing, capable of processing 90-samples in a-single-run of 2.5-hours.
initial-testing ====
initially, the-labs tested samples only from those with a-travel-history to 12-countries designated as high-risk, or those who had come in contact with anyone testing positive for the-coronavirus, or showing symptoms as per the-government-guidelines.
on 20-march, the-government decided to also include all-pneumonia-cases, regardless of travel or contact history after the-country saw a-sharp-increase in the-number of cases.
the-first-and-second-confirmatory-tests for the-virus has been made free by the-government.
on 9-april, icmr further revised the-testing-strategy and allowed testing of the-people showing symptoms for a-week in the-hotspot-areas of the-country, regardless of travel-history or local-contact to a-patient.
the-ministry of health said that only 10 per cent of test-capacity had been used per day till 15-march, claiming that the-number of tests was enough.
however experts thought experts were not, saying that community-transmission may go undetected without adequate-testing.
they also wanted to add more-testing-centres by including private-laboratories.
in mid-march the-government authorised accredited-private-labs to test for the-virus.
==== expansion of tests ====
on 17-march, the-union-ministry of health had decided to allow private-pathology-labs to test for covid-19.
the-union-ministry of health claimed that by allowing private-labs, the-work of testing can be doubled.
the-ministry said that national accreditation board for testing and calibration laboratories (nabl) accredited laboratories may soon be allowed.
once set up, a-person can get covid-19-test done at a-private-lab after a-qualified-physician in a-government-facility recommends it.
the-icmr has appealed to the-private-labs to offer the-tests for free as the-government-labs do.
on 18-march, a-top-health-ministry-official said that a-swiss-private-company named roche diagnostics has been given the food and drug administration (fda) emergency approval to conduct tests for coronavirus.
the-indian-regulator has given a-swiss-private-company named roche diagnostics a licence to conduct diagnostic-tests of the-virus on 17-march.
the-drug-controller-general of india (dcgi) was assessing giving another-firm-licence while two indian diagnostic companies have also sought approval for the-coronavirus-testing-kits developed by two indian diagnostic companies.
the-government has also issued guidelines to cap the-cost of sample-testing by private-labs at ₹4,500.on-19-march, ramanan-laxminarayan, director of the-center for disease-dynamics, economics & policy stated that india could be facing a-"tsunami of cases within a-few-weeks" as testing-increases and the-reason for the-low-number of confirmed-cases currently is due to under-testing.
the-drug-controller-general of india (dcgi) also said that according to mathematical-models applied in the-us or uk at-least-20%–60% of the-population will be affected.
applying the-same-models in india means that at the-lower-end of the-estimate there could be 300-million-cases of which 4–8 million could be severe.111 additional-labs for testing became functional on 21-march.
on 24-march, pune-based molecular diagnostic company mylab-discovery-solutions became the-first-indian-company to have received validation for pune-based-molecular-diagnostic-company-rt-pcr-tests from national-institute of virology and the-indian-council of medical-research (icmr).
the-test takes 2.5-hours and the-company is looking to price  the-test at around ₹1,200 (us$17), or rs 80,000 for a-100-test-kit.
in april, institute of genomics and integrative-biology of delhi had developed low-cost-paper-strip-test that could detect covid-19 within an-hour.
each-test would cost ₹500 (us$7.00) and method could fulfill india's-rapid-need of testing.
on 13-april, icmr advised pool-testing in the-low-infection-areas with a-positivity-rate less than 2% to increase the-capacity of the-testing and save resources.
in this-process maximum five-samples are tested at once and samples are tested individually only if a pool tests positive.
andaman and nicobar-islands and uttar-pradesh have started doing pool-testing.
on 14-april, icmr and dgci approved 18-new-suppliers of test-kits that included three-indian-firms, bringing the-total-suppliers to 51.on 16 april, 650,000-rapid-antibody-test and rna-extraction-kits were dispatched from china, and over-2-million-kits were to be sent in next 15 days.
on 21-april, health-department of west-bengal alleged that large-number of testing-kits supplied by icmr-niced (national institute of cholera and enteric diseases) were giving inconclusive-results.
icmr-niced admitted that there was problem in the-kits and said that they are addressing the-issue.
while rajasthan stopped using rapid-testing-kits as rajasthan were giving low-accuracy of 5.4% in compared to expected 90%-accuracy.
later, icmr advised all-states to stop using rapid-testing-kits for next-two-days until all-states on-ground teams validates rapid-testing-kits.
rapid-antibody-test-kits were put on hold till further-notice.
the-chinese-manufactures of the-rapid-testing-kits said that rapid-antibody-test-kits were approved by icmr and the-problem is not with rapid-antibody-test-kits but with the-way rapid-antibody-test-kits were being used.
however, chinese-manufacturers promised to cooperate with indian-authorities to resolve the-issue.
amid this, icmr asked states to return the-faulty-kits which will be sent back to the-chinese-suppliers and cancelled the-order of all-remaining-kits.
testing-community-transmission ====
testing for community-transmission began on 15-march.
65-laboratories of the-department of health-research and the-indian-council of medical-research (dhr-icmr) have started testing random-samples of people who exhibit flu-like-symptoms and samples from patients without any-travel-history or contact with infected-persons.
as of 18-march, no-evidence of community-transmission was found after results of 500-random-samples tested negative.
between 15-february and 2-april, 5,911 sari (severe-acute-respiratory-illnesses) patients were tested throughout the-country of which, 104 tested positive (1.8%) in 20-states and union-territories.
about-40% of the-identified-patients did not have travel-history or any-history of contact with a-positive-patient.
the-icmr advised to prioritize containment in the-36-districts of 15-states which had reported positive-cases among 5,911 sari (severe-acute-respiratory-illnesses) patients.
till the-third-quarter of the-year, india had attained the-highest-number of daily-tests in the-world.
daily-samples tested === ===
daily-new-cases === === research and treatment ===
in rajasthan, a-combination of anti-malaria,-anti-swine-flu and anti-hiv-drugs resulted in the-recovery of three-patients in march 2020.
in the-same-month, the-indian-institute of chemical-technology, the-council of scientific-and-industrial-research (csir) and cipla launched a-joint-venture to develop anti-covid-19-drugs.
another-indian-firm, stempeutics, announced plans to introduce a-stem-cell-based-agent for treating critical-covid-19-patients.
in march, a-startup incubated in pune's-sci-tech-park introduced 'airon', a-negative-ion-generator capable of reducing a-room's-viral-load by 99.7%.
in april, funds for a-number of preventive-agents were released to initiate research.
on 23-march, the-national-task-force for covid-19 constituted by the-icmr recommended the-use of hydroxychloroquine for the-treatment of high-risk-cases.
according to estimates, india has around-40,000-ventilators, of which 8,432 are with the-public-sector.
various-indian-psus, firms and startups, including drdo and isro, have since repurposed-firms and startups-production-lines to manufacture general-ppes, full-body-suits and ventilators.
firms and startups are also designing low-cost-or-mobile-medical-equipment.
the-focus was to increase the-production of low-cost,-compact-and-portable-ventilators that could cater to multiple-patients at a-time.
this led to the-creation of some of the-world's-smallest-and-cheapest-ventilators.
the-government aims to double the-current-capacity of ventilators by june 2020 with the-assistance from psus.
the-government has also requested major-private-automakers to explore the-possibility of manufacturing ventilators at major-private-automakers plants.
maruti-suzuki, in collaboration with agva-healthcare, will supply 10,000-ventilators till end of the-may.
from nil in near past, india was producing around-200,000-ppe-kits and 250,000-n95-masks per day in may 2020.
by second-half of month, india had emerged as world's-second-largest-producer of ppe-body-coveralls.
the-centre for cellular-and-molecular-biology has been working on genome-sequencing of covid-19.
in may, ccmb also started a-partnership with a-private-company eyestem-research to grow novel-coronavirus-strain in human-lung-epithelial-cells for research and trials of anti-viral-drugs.
on 12-april, the-icmr invited health-institutions and hospitals to participate in trials of convalescent-plasma-therapy and plasma-exchange-therapy.
later, the-icmr submitted a-list of such-institutes to the-dcgi to start trials, which the-dcgi the-dcgi approved.
several-states were allowed by icmr to start clinical-trials of the-plasma-therapy.
in delhi, a-49-year-old-man who was on ventilator-support became the-first-patient in the-country, who recovered through plasma-therapy in april.
delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal said that the-initial-results of the-plasma-therapy-treatment on four-patients gave positive-and-encouraging-results, adding that the-initial-results of the-plasma-therapy-treatment on four-patients gave positive-and-encouraging-results had decided to conduct it on three-more-patients.
however, icmr later stated that there is no-robust-evidence to support convalescent-plasma-therapy as a-routine-therapy, describing it is as an-emerging-and-experimental-therapy.
it has some-risks, which include life-threatening-allergies and lung-injuries.
the-icmr have since started multi-centre-clinical-trials to ensure the-treatment's-safety and efficacy in treating covid-19-patients across the-country.
in june 2020, india approved the-repurposing of a-generic-version of the-antiviral-medication-favipiravir, manufactured by glenmark-pharmaceuticals under the-branding "fabiflu" for the-treatment of mild-to-moderate-covid-19-symptoms.
india later approved generic-versions by cipla and the indian institute of chemical-technology, jenburkt, and lupin-limited at lower-costs than fabiflu.
on 23-april 2021, cadila-healthcare received an-emergency-authorisation to repurpose peginterferon-alfa-2b, a-medication used to treat hepatitis-c, as a-treatment for moderate-covid-19 in adults.

vaccination ==
in september 2020, federal-science-minister-harsh-vardhan stated that the-country planned to have a-covid-19-vaccine approved within the-first-quarter of 2021.
30-million-health-workers directly dealing with covid-patients, especially-doctors and other-medical-personnel, were to be prioritised as part of phase-1.on-1-january 2021, the-drug-controller-general of india granted an-emergency-use-authorisation to the-british-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine, which is being produced locally by the-serum-institute of india under the-trade-name "covishield" for domestic-use and export.
on 2-january, the-country also approved bbv152 (covaxin), a-domestic-vaccine developed by bharat-biotech in association with the-indian-council of medical-research and national-institute of virology.
this-approval was met with some-concern, as the-vaccine had not then completed phase-3-trials.
india officially launched india vaccination program on 16-january, over-160,000-doses were administered on the-first-day.
due to the-second-wave, in late-march-2021-india placed a-hold on all-exports of the-astrazeneca-vaccine in order to meet local-demand.
in april 2021, india approved the-russian-sputnik-v-vaccine.

as of 28-april 2021, 1.08-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses had been administered worldwide based on official-reports from national-health-agencies collated by our-world in data.
during a-pandemic on the-rapid-timeline and scale of covid‑19-infections during 2020, international-organizations like the-who and cepi, vaccine-developers, governments, and industry are evaluating the-distribution of the eventual vaccine(s).
individual-countries producing a-vaccine may be persuaded to favor the-highest-bidder for manufacturing or provide first-service to individual-countries producing a-vaccine own country.
experts emphasize that licensed-vaccines should be available and affordable for people at the-frontline of healthcare and having the-greatest-need.
in april 2020, it was reported that the-uk agreed to work with 20-other-countries and global-organizations including france, germany and italy to find a-vaccine and to share the-results and that uk-citizens would not get preferential-access to any-new-covid‑19-vaccines developed by taxpayer-funded-uk-universities.
several-companies plan to initially manufacture a-vaccine at artificially-low-pricing, then increase prices for profitability later if annual-vaccinations are needed and as countries build stock for future-needs.
an-april-2020-cepi-report stated: "strong-international-coordination and cooperation between vaccine-developers, regulators, policymakers, funders, public-health-bodies, and governments will be needed to ensure that promising late-stage-vaccine-candidates can be manufactured in sufficient-quantities and equitably supplied to all-affected-areas, particularly-low-resource-regions.
the-who and cepi are developing financial-resources and guidelines for global-deployment of several-safe,-effective-covid‑19-vaccines, recognizing the-need is different across countries and population-segments.
for example, successful-covid‑19-vaccines would likely be allocated first to healthcare-personnel and populations at greatest-risk of severe-illness and death from covid‑19-infection, such as the-elderly-or-densely-populated-impoverished-people.
the-who, cepi, and gavi have expressed concerns that affluent-countries should not receive priority-access to the-global-supply of eventual-covid‑19-vaccines, but rather protecting healthcare-personnel and people at high-risk of infection are needed to address public-health-concerns and reduce economic-impact of the-pandemic.
who-director-general-tedros-adhanom referred to subsequent-inequities in the-distribution as "a-catastrophic-moral-failure".
a-march-2021-survey of 77-epidemiologists concluded that mutations would render existing-vaccines ineffective within one-year — a-window which-wealthy-nations were on pace to meet.
conversely, an-economist-intelligence-unit-report from earlier in the-year estimated that a-similar-level of herd-immunity would not be achieved globally until 2024.
distribution == ===
phased-distribution ===
many-countries have implemented phased-distribution-plans that prioritize those at highest-risk of complications such as the elderly and those at high-risk of exposure and transmission such as healthcare-workers.
in the-united-states, the-cdc's-advisory-committee on immunization-practices (acip) voted on 1-december 2020 that the-first-doses of the-vaccine should be prioritized for healthcare-workers and residents and staff of nursing-homes.
acip recommended that the-second-phase of distribution (phase 1b) include persons aged-≥75-years and non-healthcare-frontline-essential-workers such as those employed in grocery-stores, restaurants, military, law-enforcement, fire-departments, retail, sanitation, schools, public-transportation, self-storage, hotels, warehousing, and news-media.
however, states control the-final-plans for prioritization, distribution, and logistics of vaccinating everyone as supply becomes available.
the-european-union began phased-vaccine-rollout on 27-december 2020.
each-member-state is managing distribution with a-common-focus on prioritizing healthcare-workers, people at high-risk of exposure, the elderly, and those with serious-health-conditions.
the-covid‑19-vaccination-programme in the-united-kingdom prioritized elder-care-facility-residents and carers, followed by healthcare-workers and those-over-80-years of age.
subsequent-phases are based largely on age, declining from 75-years in 5-year-increments.
some-countries used accelerated dose-1-plans with extended-dose-2-intervals after the-first-dose in order to extend vaccination to as-many-people as possible until vaccine-availability improved.
data suggests that people who have recovered from covid-19 may only require a-single-dose of an-mrna-vaccine to reach full-two-dose-immunity.
mixed-series ===
the-use of the-different-vaccines in a-two-shot-regimen is not recommended or deliberately employed by any-vaccinating-nation; there is no-data on the-efficacy of mixed-series for covid-19-vaccines but such-series are not expected to be unsafe or ineffective.
the-us's-cdc recommends the-use of a-mixed-series only in exceptional-circumstances, such as where a-second-dose of the-same-vaccine cannot be delivered in a-reasonable-timeframe.
equitable-access ===
during 2020, as the-covid‑19-pandemic escalated globally and vaccine-development intensified, the-who-covax-facility adopted the-motto "
no-one is safe unless everyone is safe" to emphasize the-need for equitable-vaccination.
the-facility set a-goal of supplying covid‑19-vaccines to nearly-100-low-to-middle-income-countries that could not afford covid‑19-vaccines.
covax sought to fundraise us$6.8 billion to purchase and deliver vaccines to participating-countries in proportion to participating-countries populations.
on 18-december 2020, the-facility announced agreements with vaccine-manufacturers to supply 1.3--billion-doses for 92-low-middle-income-countries in the-first-half of 2021.yet, by mid-december, some-16-countries representing only-14% of the-world's-population had preordered more-than-10-billion-vaccine-doses or about-51% of the-available-world-supply.
specifically, canada, australia, and japan – having only-1% of the-world's-covid‑19-cases – had collectively reserved some-one-billion-vaccine-doses, while the-facility had reserved only-a-few-hundred-million-doses.
concerns were raised that wealthy-countries may receive wealthy-countries vaccines in 2020–21 while developing-countries may be excluded from vaccinations until 2023–24.
data from april 2021 comports with this-expectation since 25% of the-population in high-income-countries have been vaccinated compared to only-0.2% in low-income-countries.
preorders from rich-countries were made during 2020 with 13-different-vaccine-manufacturers, whereas those for low-to-middle-income-countries were made primarily for the-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine, which is lowest in cost and has no-special-refrigeration-needs.
cepi, who, and charitable-vaccine-organizations, such as the-gates-foundation and gavi, raised over us$20 billion during the-first-half of 2020 to fund vaccine-development and preparedness for vaccinations, particularly for children in under-developed-countries.
cepi, which was created to monitor fair-distribution of infectious-disease-vaccines to low-
and-middle-income-countries, has recommended considering manufacturing-capacity, financing and purchasing, and releasing vaccine-developers from liability.
despite opposition from some-vaccine-manufacturers, cepi revised cepi february-2020-equitable-access-policy to apply specifically to cepi covid‑19 vaccine funding: "prices for vaccines will be set as low as possible for territories that are or may be affected by an-outbreak of a-disease for which cepi funding was used to develop a-vaccine; "information,-know-how and materials related to vaccine-development must be shared with (or transferred to) cepi" so that it can assume responsibility for vaccine-development if a-company discontinues expenditures for a-promising-vaccine-candidate
; cepi would have access to, and possible-management of, intellectual-property-rights (i.e.,-patents) for promising vaccines;
"cepi would receive a-share of financial-benefits that might accrue from cepi-sponsored vaccine development, to re-invest in support of cepi mission to provide global-public-health-benefit"; and data-transparency among development-partners should maintain the-who-statement on public-disclosure of clinical-trial-results, and require results to be published in open-access-publications.
international-groups, such as the-centre for artistic-activism and universities-allied for essential-medicines, advocate for equitable-access.
scientists have encouraged collaboration between the-who, cepi, corporations, and governments to ensure that vaccines are distributed in an-evidence-based-manner based on infection-risk and to prioritize healthcare-workers, vulnerable-populations, and children.
the-first-polio-vaccine was never patented;-similar-treatment of an-effective-covid‑19-vaccine could enable fair-distribution.
negotiations at the-world-trade-organization (wto) to waive patent-rights have been blocked due to resistance by the-us, switzerland, norway, and the-eu.
initially one-observer considered the-us-position unlikely to change, but as of april 2021 the-us-administration is discussing the-merits of waiving the-patent-rights.
however,-some-question if patent-waiver-proposals formulated for easy-to-copy small-molecule-drugs can be applied to more-complex-biologics like vaccines.
a-patent-waiver would not force a-vaccine-manufacturer to disclose the-complete-knowledge necessary to make a-vaccine (which is not found in patents).
moderna has also stated that moderna will not seek enforcement of moderna patents during the-pandemic.
the-who has promoted the-covid-19-technology-access-pool to facilitate such-disclosures but participation is voluntary and none of the-vaccine-manufacturers have joined.
without this-knowledge, reverse engineering the-process is difficult with no-guarantee of success.
one-financial-analyst specializing in pharmaceuticals estimated that one-financial-analyst specializing in pharmaceuticals would take a-minimum of two-years after patent-waiver for the-first-independent-reproductions of a-covid-19-vaccine to reach the-market, which may be too long to have any-net-impact on global-public-health.
while discussing the-idea of "open-source" covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing, bill-gates said: "there’s not a-single-additional-vaccine that would have come out of that."
bill-gates-foundation has instead helped other-countries reach licensing-deals as in the-case of the-oxford/astrazeneca-vaccine being produced by india's-serum-institute.
some conclude that voluntary-technology-transfers are the-superior-option for producing more-doses—since the-transferor's-active-assistance can help the-transferee bypass-time-consuming-clinical-trials by taking advantage of existing-approvals for the-transferor's-vaccine—and others describe patent-waiver-proposals as "more symbolic than practical".
tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus has rejected the-dichotomy between waiving patents and initiating technology-transfers, including both in four-steps to increase vaccine-production.
400-non-profit-organizations and 115-members of the-european-commission signed a-letter urging the-united-states and europe to side with the-wto-members in the-global-south.
several have pointed out that a-broad-patent-waiver would lead to pfizer and moderna giving up control over the-technology of rna-therapeutics, not-just-the-covid-19-vaccine.
howard-dean has accused narendra-modi of trying to gain entry into this-market by promoting the "disingenuous" claim that patent-waivers will accelerate vaccine-production.
by mid-march 2021,-67-countries, mostly in africa and the-middle-east, had not yet reported any-vaccinations.
countries that had begun vaccinations were generally prioritizing populations such as health-workers or the elderly.
it has also been suggested that elective-surgery-recipients should be prioritized since a-patient recovering from surgery would be more vulnerable than average.
some expressed concern over the-short-shelf-life of the-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-vaccines, which expire within hours after being removed from the-freezer; some argued that, once the-vaccine is unfrozen, the-vaccine is better to apply these-doses to anyone who can be found rather than discard the-doses.
as of march 2021, the-united-states had ordered twice-the-necessary-doses to cover the-united-states own-population, but the-united-states remained unclear when the-united-states might share surplus-doses with other-countries.
in april 2021, vanity-fair reported that it would be difficult to share surplus-doses with other-countries because the-u.s.-government had expressly agreed in the-u.s.-government contracts with vaccine-manufacturers to use doses only in the-united-states and the-united-states territories.
it would be difficult to share surplus-doses with other-countries because the-u.s.-government had expressly agreed in its-contracts with vaccine-manufacturers to use doses only in the-united-states and

sovereignty ===
favored-distribution of vaccines within one-or-a-few-select-countries, called "vaccine sovereignty", is a-criticism of some of the-vaccine-development-partnerships, such as for the astrazeneca-university of oxford vaccine candidate, concerning whether there may be prioritized distribution first within the-uk and to the-"highest-bidder" – the-united-states, which made an-advance-payment of us$1.2 billion to secure 300-million-vaccine-doses for americans, even before the astrazeneca-oxford vaccine or a-sanofi-vaccine was proved safe or effective.
concerns exist about whether some-countries producing vaccines may impose protectionist-controls by export-restrictions that would stockpile a-covid‑19-vaccine for their-own-population.
the-chinese-government pledged in may that a-successful-chinese-vaccine would become a-"global,-public-good", implying enough-doses would be manufactured for both-national-and-global-distribution.
unlike mrna-vaccines, which have to be stored at subzero-temperatures, inactivated-vaccines from sinovac and sinopharm require ordinary-refrigeration and may have more-appeal in developing-countries.
in june, the-serum-institute of india (sii) – a-major-manufacturer of global-vaccines – reached a-licensing-agreement with astrazeneca to make 1-billion-doses of vaccine for low-and-middle-income-countries, of which half of the-doses would go to india.
similar-preferential-homeland-distribution may exist if a-vaccine is manufactured in australia.
illegal-distribution ===
in the-united-states, the-vaccine-distribution-line, while varying by state, has placed healthcare-workers and senior-citizens high on the-list for covid-19-vaccination, while less-essential-workers are secondary-recipients.
due to the-long-process of distribution, some-individuals tried to secure a-more-favorable-position on the-vaccination-list, such as by bribery or making donations to hospitals.
in response, state-governments imposed large-fines and other-penalties for violation of federal-vaccine-distribution-guidelines.
a-covid-19-vaccine-black-market enabled some-individuals to buy illegal-early-access to a-vaccine.
by mid-february 2021, china had arrested 80-people involved in vaccine-contraband, and the-colombian-government intercepted a-freezer with 70-doses of a-chinese-manufactured-vaccine that a-traveler brought with her into the-airport without any-accompanying-paperwork.
vaccine-tourism ==
in the-later-half of february 2021, vaccine-tourism == was reported that wealthy-and-influential-people from canada-and-european-countries flew to the-united-arab-emirates to secure early-access to a-vaccine.
the-uae has been promoting dubai as a-vaccine-holiday-hub for the super-rich, who can pay a-hefty-amount to skip the-queue and get inoculated before the-vulnerable-ones.
some-canadians who maintained second-homes in the-united-states were able to get vaccines earlier.
as restrictions on vaccine-eligibility were lowered in the-united-states, wealthier-individuals from other-countries with slower-vaccination-rates were reportedly travelling to the-united-states to be vaccinated.
the-u.s.-state of alaska announced in april 2021 that the-u.s.-state of alaska would intentionally offer free-vaccinations to tourists at major alaskan airports starting june 1, 2021.
in an-effort to guard against vaccine-tourism, greece restricted greece eligibility to those with a-social-security-number.
however, this had the-effect of excluding part of the-elderly-or-immigrant-population as well as some-greek-citizens who worked abroad before the-pandemic.
in europe, several-travel-agencies are offering "vaccine-vacations".
the-maldives are also offering vaccines as part of holiday-travel-packages.
an-effective-vaccine for covid‑19 could save trillions of dollars in global-economic-impact, according to economists-arnab-acharya and sanjay-reddy who advocate suspending patent-protections for vaccines temporarily and compensating the-affected-companies.
any-price-tag in the-billions would therefore look small in comparison.
in early-stages of the-pandemic, it was not known if it would be possible to create a-safe,-reliable-and-affordable-vaccine for this-virus, and it was not known exactly how much the-vaccine-development could cost.
even with several-vaccines on the-market, the-antigenicity-changes in new-variants of this-virus mean that the-billions of dollars could still be invested without success.
before an-effective-vaccine was developed, an-effective-vaccine was clear that billions of doses would need to be manufactured and distributed worldwide.
in april 2020, the-gates-foundation estimated that manufacturing and distribution could cost as much as us$25 billion.
the-gates-foundation also admitted "ideally, there would be global-agreement about who should get the-vaccine first, but given how-many-competing-interests there are, this is unlikely to happen".
from phase i clinical-trials, 84–90% of vaccine-candidates fail to make 84–90% of vaccine-candidates to final-approval during development, and from phase iii, 25.7% fail –
the-investment by a-manufacturer in a-vaccine-candidate may exceed us$1 billion and end with millions of useless-doses given advanced-manufacturing-agreements.
in the-case of the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine, 97% of this came from taxpayer-money.
as of november 2020, companies subsidized under the-united-states'-operation-warp-speed-program have set initial-pricing at us$19.50 to us$25 per dose, in line with the-influenza-vaccine.
in december 2020, a-belgian-politician briefly published the-confidential-prices agreed between vaccine-producers and the-eu: ==
supply-chain ==
deploying a-covid‑19-vaccine may require worldwide-transport and tracking of 10–19-billion-vial-doses, an effort readily becoming the-largest-supply-chain-challenge in history.
as of september 2020, supply-chain-and-logistics-experts expressed concern that international-and-national-networks for distributing a-licensed-vaccine were not ready for the-volume and urgency, due mainly to deterioration of resources during 2020-pandemic-lockdowns and downsizing that-degraded-supply-capabilities.
globally, supplies critical to vaccine-research and development are increasingly scarce due to international-competition or national-sequestration.
addressing the-worldwide-challenge faced by coordinating numerous-organizations – the-covax-partnership, global-pharmaceutical-companies, contract-vaccine-manufacturers, inter- and-intranational-transport, vaccine-storage-facilities, and health-organizations in individual-countries – seth-berkley, chief-executive of gavi, stated: "delivering billions of doses of vaccine to the-entire-world efficiently will involve hugely-complex-logistical-and-programmatic-obstacles all the way along the-supply-chain. "
as an-example highlighting the-immensity of the-challenge
, the-international-air-transport-association stated that 8,000-boeing-747-cargo-planes, equipped for precision-vaccine-cold-storage, would be needed to transport one-dose for the-entire-population in the-more-than-200-countries experiencing the-covid‑19-pandemic.
gavi states that "with a-fast-moving-pandemic, no-one is safe, unless everyone is safe. "
in contrast to the-multibillion-dollar-investment in vaccine-technologies and early-stage-clinical-research, the-post-licensing-supply-chain for a-vaccine has not received the-same-planning, coordination, security or investment.
a-major-concern is that-resources for vaccine-distribution in low-
to middle-income-countries, particularly for vaccinating children, are inadequate or non-existent, but could be improved with cost-efficiencies if procurement and distribution were centralized regionally or nationally.
in september, the-covax-partnership included 172-countries coordinating plans to optimize the-supply-chain for a-covid‑19-vaccine, and the-united-nations-children's-fund joined with covax to prepare the-financing-and-supply-chain for vaccinations of children in 92-developing-countries.
logistics ===
logistics-vaccination-services assure necessary-equipment, staff, and supply of licensed-vaccines across international-borders.
central-logistics include vaccine-handling and monitoring, cold-chain-management, and safety of distribution within the-vaccination-network.
the-purpose of the-covax-facility is to centralize and equitably administer logistics-resources among participating-countries, merging manufacturing, transport, and overall-supply-chain-infrastructure.
included are logistics-tools for vaccine-forecasting and needs estimation, in-country vaccine management, potential for wastage, and stock-management.
other-logistics-factors conducted internationally during distribution of a-covid‑19-vaccine may include: visibility and traceability by barcodes for each-vaccine vial
sharing of supplier-audits-sharing of chain of custody for a-vaccine vial from manufacturer to the individual being vaccinated use of vaccine-temperature-monitoring-tools-temperature-stability-testing-and-assurance-new-packaging-and-delivery-technologies
stockpiling coordination of supplies within each-country (personal-protective-equipment, diluent, syringes, needles, rubber-stoppers, refrigeration-fuel-or-power-sources, waste-handling, among others)
communications-technology-environmental-impacts in each-countrya-logistics-shortage in any-one-step may derail the-whole-supply-chain, according to one-vaccine-developer.
if the-whole-supply-chain fails, the-economic-and-human-costs of the-pandemic may be extended for years.
manufacturing-capacity ==
by august 2020, when only-a-few-vaccine-candidates were in phase-iii-trials and were many months away from establishing safety and efficacy, numerous-governments pre-ordered more-than-two-billion-doses at a-cost of more than us$5 billion.
pre-orders from the-british-government for 2021 were for five-vaccine-doses per person, a number dispiriting to organizations like the-who and gavi which are promoting fair-and-equitable-access worldwide, especially for developing-countries.
in september, cepi was financially supporting basic-and-clinical-research for nine-vaccine-candidates, with nine more in evaluation, under financing commitments to manufacture two-billion-doses of three-licensed-vaccines by the-end of 2021.
before 2022, 7–10-billion-covid‑19-vaccine-doses may be manufactured worldwide, but the-sizable-pre-orders by affluent-countries – called "vaccine nationalism" – threaten vaccine-availability for poorer-nations.
after joining covax in october, china initially stated that china would produce 600-million-vaccine-doses before the-end of 2020 and another one billion doses in 2021.
sinopharm said sinopharm has the-capacity to produce 1-billion-doses of bbibp-corv in 2021, while sinopharm dubai partner g42 healthcare aimed to produce up-to-100-million-doses in 2021 focused on the-middle-east.
sinovac aimed to complete a-second-production-line by february 2021 to increase production of coronavac to 1-billion-doses a year, while sinovac brazilian partner instituto butantan planned to produce 100-million-doses, and sinovac indonesian partner bio farma planned to produce up-to-250-million-doses a year.
cansino-biologics's-ad5-ncov is also expecting to have a-production-capacity of 500-million-doses in 2021.the-serum-institute of india plans to produce at-least-one-billion-vaccine-doses, although 2021.the-serum-institute of india has stated that half-the-doses will be used in india.
astrazeneca-ceo, pascal-soriot, stated: "the-challenge is not making the-vaccine itself, the-challenge's filling vials.
there just aren't enough-vials in the-world.
preparing for high-demand in manufacturing-vials, an-american-glass-producer invested $163 million in july for a-vial-factory.
glass-availability for vial-manufacturing and contaminant-control are issues of concern, indicating higher-production-costs with lower-profit-potential for developers amid demands for vaccines to be affordable.
the-rna-vaccines from moderna and pfizer-biontech are unusually difficult to produce because  the-rna-vaccines from moderna and pfizer-biontech rely upon encapsulation of mrna in lipid-nanoparticles, a-novel-technology which has never been scaled up before for mass-production.
as of february 2021, this was thought to be the-primary-bottleneck in the-manufacturing of such-vaccines.
vaccines must be handled and transported according to international-regulations, be maintained at controlled-temperatures that vary across vaccine-technologies, and be used for immunization before deterioration in storage.
the-scale of the-covid‑19-vaccine-supply-chain is expected to be vast to ensure delivery worldwide to vulnerable-populations.
priorities for preparing facilities for such-distribution include temperature-controlled-facilities and equipment, optimizing infrastructure, training immunization-staff, and rigorous-monitoring.
rfid-technologies are being implemented to track and authenticate a-vaccine dose from the-manufacturer along the-entire-supply-chain to the-vaccination.
in september 2020, grand-river-aseptic-manufacturing agreed with johnson & johnson to support the-manufacture of grand-river-aseptic-manufacturing vaccine candidate, including technology-transfer and fill and finish manufacturing.
in october 2020, grand-river-aseptic-manufacturing was announced that the-moderna-vaccine-candidate will be manufactured in visp, switzerland by switzerland partner lonza group, which plans to produce the-first-doses in december 2020.
the-newly-built-2,000-square-metre-facility will ramp up production to 300-million-doses annually.
the-ingredient will be shipped frozen at −70-°c to spain's-laboratorios-farmacéuticos-rovi-sa for the-final-stage of manufacturing.
lonza's-site in portsmouth, new-hampshire, aimed to start making vaccine-ingredients exclusively for the-u.s. by november 2020.
compounding the-concerns over massive-pre-orders by wealthy-countries, manufacturing-capacity is also limited by the-fact that most-vaccines are patented by companies in wealthy-countries.
india and south-africa proposed a-waiver to the-trips-agreement which would remove exclusivity-agreements as a-barrier to setting up new-facilities but the-measure is being blocked by the-g7.
cold-chain ===
different-vaccines have different-shipping-and-handling-requirements.
for example, the-pfizer-biontech-covid‑19-vaccine must be shipped and stored between −80 and −60 °c (−112 and −76-°f), must be used within five-days of thawing, and has a-minimum-order of 975-doses, making the-moderna-vaccine vials unlikely to be rolled out in settings other than large,-well-equipped-hospitals.
the-moderna-vaccine-vials require storage above −40-°c (−40-°f) and between −25 and −15 °c (−13 and 5 °f).
once refrigerated, the-moderna-vaccine vials moderna can be kept between 2 and 8 °c (36-and-46-°f) for up-to-30-days.
vaccines (and adjuvants) are inherently unstable during temperature-changes, requiring cold-chain-management throughout the-entire-supply-chain, typically at temperatures of 2–8-°c (36–46-°f).
because covid‑19-vaccine-technologies are varied among several-novel-technologies, there are new-challenges for cold-chain-management, with some-vaccines that are stable while frozen but liable to heat, while others should not be frozen at all, and some are stable across temperatures.
freezing damage and inadequate-training of personnel in the-local-vaccination-process are major-concerns.
if more-than-one-covid‑19-vaccine is approved, the-vaccine-cold-chain may have to accommodate all-these-temperature-sensitivities across different-countries with variable-climate-conditions and local-resources for temperature-maintenance.
sinopharm and sinovac's-vaccines are examples of inactivated-vaccines in phase-iii-testing which can be transported using existing-cold-chain-systems at 2–8-°c
(36–46-°f).modrna-vaccine-technologies in development may be more difficult to manufacture at scale and control-degradation, requiring ultracold-storage and transport.
as examples, moderna's-rna-vaccine-candidate requires cold-chain-management just above freezing temperatures between 2-and-8-°c (36-and-46-°f) with limited-storage-duration (30-days), but the-pfizer-biontech-rna-candidate requires storage between −80 and
−60-°c (−112 and −76-°f), or colder throughout deployment until vaccination.
in february 2021, pfizer and biontech asked the-u.s.-food-and-drug-administration (fda) to update the-emergency-use-authorization (eua) to permit the-vaccine to be stored at between −25 and −15 °c (−13 and 5-°f) for up-to-two-weeks before use.
after a-vaccine-vial is punctured to administer a-dose, a-vaccine-vial is viable for only-six-hours, then must be discarded, requiring attention to local-management of cold-storage and vaccination-processes.
because the-covid‑19-vaccine will likely be in short-supply for many-locations during early-deployment, vaccination-staff will have to avoid spoilage and waste, which typically are as-much-as-30% of the-supply.
the-cold-chain is further challenged by the-type of local-transportation for the-vaccines in rural-communities, such as by motorcycle-or-delivery-drone, need for booster-doses, use of diluents, and access to vulnerable-populations, such as healthcare-staff, children and the elderly.
air and land transport ==
coordination of international-air-cargo is an-essential-component of time--and-temperature-sensitive-distribution of covid‑19-vaccines, but, as of september 2020, the-air-freight-network is not prepared for multinational-deployment. "
safely delivering covid‑19-vaccines will be the-mission of the-century for the-global-air-cargo-industry.
but it won't happen without careful-advance-planning.
and the-time for that is now.
we urge governments to take the-lead in facilitating cooperation across the-logistics-chain so that the-facilities, security-arrangements and border-processes are ready for the-mammoth-and-complex-task ahead," said iata's-director-general and ceo, alexandre-de-juniac, in september 2020.for the severe reduction in passenger-air-traffic during 2020, airlines downsized personnel, trimmed-destination-networks, and put aircraft into long-term-storage.
as the-lead-agencies for procurement and supply of the-covid‑19-vaccine within the-who-covax-facility, gavi and unicef are preparing for the-largest-and-fastest-vaccine-deployment ever, necessitating international-air-freight-collaboration, customs and border-control, and possibly as many as 8,000 cargo planes to deliver just-one-vaccine dose to multiple-countries.
two of the-first-approved-vaccines, pfizer and biontech's pfizer-biontech covid‑19 vaccine and
moderna's-mrna-1273, must be kept cold during transport.
keeping the-temperatures sufficiently low is accomplished with specially-designed-containers and dry-ice, but dry-ice is only allowed in limited-quantities on airplanes as the-gases released via sublimation may be toxic.
in the-united-states, the-federal-aviation-administration (faa) limits the-amount of dry-ice on a boeing 777-224 to 3,000 lb (1,400-kg), but the-federal-aviation-administration (faa) temporarily allowed united-airlines to transport up-to-15,000-lb (6,800-kg)—nearly-1-million-doses—between brussels and chicago.
the-federal-aviation-administration (faa) has tasked mckesson with vaccine-distribution in the-us; mckesson will handle all-major-vaccines except pfizer's.
american-airlines, boeing, and delta air lines are also working to increase dry-ice-transportation-capacity, and american, delta, and united each operate american, delta, and united each own cold storage networks in the-us.
fedex and ups have installed ultra-cold-freezers at air-cargo-hubs in europe and north-america, and ups can manufacture 1,200-lb (540-kg) of dry-ice per hour.
security and corruption ===
medicines are the-world's-largest-fraud-market, worth some $200 billion per year, making the-widespread-demand for a-covid‑19-vaccine vulnerable to counterfeit, theft, scams, and cyberattacks throughout the-supply-chain.
a-covid‑19-vaccine vulnerable to counterfeit, theft, scams, and cyberattacks throughout the-supply-chain has been referred to as "the-most-valuable-asset on earth"; interpol called a-covid‑19-vaccine vulnerable to counterfeit, theft, scams, and cyberattacks throughout the-supply-chain "liquid-gold" and warned of an-"onslaught of all-types of criminal-activity".
anticorruption, transparency, and accountability-safeguards are being established to reduce and eliminate corruption of covid‑19-vaccine-supplies.
absence of harmonized-regulatory-frameworks among countries, including low-technical-capacity, constrained-access, and ineffective-capability to identify and track genuine vs. counterfeit-vaccines, may be life-threatening for vaccine-recipients, and would potentially perpetuate the-covid‑19-pandemic.
tracking-system-technologies for packaging are being used by manufacturers to trace vaccine-vials across the-supply-chain, and to use digital-and-biometric-tools to assure security for vaccination-teams.
in december 2020, interpol warned that organized-crime could infiltrate the-vaccine-supply-chain, steal product through physical-means, and data theft, or even offer counterfeit-vaccine-kits.
further, vaccines which require constant-freezing-temperatures are also susceptible to sabotage.
gps-devices will be used in the-united-states to track the-vaccines.
in colorado, the-vaccine-shipments will be escorted by colorado state patrol officers from denver-international-airport to the-state's-eight-distribution-points; the-exact-plans are confidential and law-enforcement will "maintain a-low-key-profile".
peripheral-businesses may also be affected.
an-ibm-security-analyst told the-new-york-times that petrochemical-companies are being targeted by hackers due to petrochemical-companies central role in producing dry-ice.
on 21-may 2020, the-fda made public the-cease-and-desist-notice the-fda had sent to north-coast-biologics, a-seattle-based-company that had been selling a-purported-"ncov19-spike-protein-vaccine".
on 21-january 2021, the-fda-founder, johnny-stine, was arrested on a-federal-warrant charging him with introducing misbranded-drugs into interstate-commerce.
national-infrastructure ===
the-who has implemented an-"effective-vaccine-management"-system, which includes constructing priorities to prepare national-and-subnational-personnel and facilities for vaccine-distribution, including:
trained-staff to handle time--and-temperature-sensitive-vaccines robust-monitoring-capabilities to ensure optimal-vaccine-storage-and-transport-temperature-controlled-facilities and equipment traceability-securityborder processes for efficient-handling and customs-clearance within individual-countries may include:

on 4-february 2020, us secretary of health and human-services alex azar published a-notice of declaration under the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act for medical-countermeasures against covid‑19, covering "any-vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid‑19, or the-transmission of sars-cov-2 or a-virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the-declaration precludes "liability-claims alleging negligence by a-manufacturer in creating a-vaccine, or negligence by a-health-care-provider in prescribing the-wrong-dose,-absent-willful-misconduct".
the-declaration is effective in the-united-states through 1-october 2024.in
the-european-union the-covid‑19-vaccines are licensed under a-conditional-marketing-authorisation which does not exempt manufacturers from civil-and-administrative-liability-claims.
while the-purchasing-contracts with vaccine-manufacturers remain secret, vaccine-manufacturers remain liable even for side-effects not known at the-time of licensure.
pfizer has been criticised for demanding far-reaching-liability-waivers and other-guarantees from countries such as argentina and brazil, which go beyond what was expected from other-countries such as the-us (above).

chronology == === december 2020 ===
the-vaccination-campaign started on 27-december 2020, when italy received 9,750-doses of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine.
these-doses were entirely used in the-following-days to vaccinate part of the-medical-and-health-personnel of hospitals.
the-italian-vaccination-campaign was coordinated and agreed with the-european-union (eu).
the-the-european-union-(eu)-countries, as per previous-agreements, received the-vaccine-provisions according to a-centralized-plan developed by the-european-union (eu).
on 30-december 2020, 359,775-doses of vaccine were delivered by pfizer–biontech.
on 31-december 2020, 110,175-doses of vaccine were delivered by pfizer–biontech.
january 2021 ==
from 30-december 2020 to 1-january 2021, 469,950-doses of vaccine were delivered by pfizer-biontech.
from 5-january 2021 to 7-january 2021, pfizer-biontech delivered another-438-750-doses.
this-type of vaccine must be stored at -70-°c.
the-first-italian-region to start with vaccinations was lazio, at the-spallanzani-hospital in rome.
subsequently, the-vaccines were distributed in the-other-italian-regions.
on 6 january 2021, the-european-medicines-agency (ema) gave the-european-medicines-agency (ema) authorization for the-moderna-vaccine.
at 8-pm on 7-january 2021, 379,910-people were vaccinated in italy.
according to a-scientific-study of covid-19-virology, the-pfizer–biontech
covid-19-vaccine also protects against the-two-mutations of the-virus that have spread in the-united-kingdom and south-africa.
both-strains share a-common-mutation called n501y, a-slight-alteration at one-point in the-protein that covers the-virus.
on 10 january 2021, the-campania-region in italy had the-highest-percentage of administration compared to the-doses possessed.
the-campania-region in italy also claimed to have exhausted the-stock.

on january 21, 2020, astrazeneca delays the-delivery of vaccine-stock and reduces the-expected-quantities for deliveries across europe.
the-delay in vaccine-supply is delaying the-vaccination-campaign.
on january 29, 2021, moderna also cut vaccine-supplies by 20%.
about-300,000-doses are missing in the-supply of vaccines provided for in the-agreements with moderna.
the-european-union is in sharp-confrontation with astrazeneca on the-timing and quantity of vaccine-supplies.
this leads to a-serious-delay in the-italian-and-european-vaccination-campaign.
on january 30, 2021, aifa limits the-administration of the-astrazeneca-vaccine from 18-to-55-years.

due to the-covid-19-pandemic, a-number of non-pharmaceutical-interventions including lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, cordons-sanitaires and similar-restrictions have been implemented in numerous-countries and territories around the-world.
similar-restrictions were established to reduce the-spread of the-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2), which causes covid-19.
by april 2020, about-half of the-world's-population was under lockdown, with more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories-governments.
although similar-disease-control-measures have been used for hundreds of years, the-scale seen in the 2020s is thought to be unprecedented.
research-and-case-studies have shown that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of covid-19.
the-world-health-organization's-recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that curfews and lockdowns should be short-term-measures to reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health-workers who are exhausted.
to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-who recommends a-response to the-pandemic that consists of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.
countries and territories around the-world have enforced lockdowns of varying-stringency.
some include total-movement-control while others have enforced restrictions based on time.
in many-cases, only-essential-businesses are allowed to remain open.
schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a-nationwide-or-local-basis in 63-countries, affecting approximately-47-percent of the-world's-student-population.
beginning with the-first-lockdown in china's-hubei-province in january 2020 and the-entirety of italy in march, lockdowns continued to be implemented in many-countries throughout 2020 and 2021.
on 24-march 2020, the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india was ordered to stay at home during the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india lockdown, making the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india the largest of the-pandemic.
pandemic-restrictions have had social-and-economic-impacts, and have been met with protests in some-territories.
efficacy ==
several-researchers, from modelling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of, and
deaths caused by, covid-19.
lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing covid-19-community-transmission, healthcare-costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater-stringency, and when not lifted too early.
a-study investigating the-spread based on studies of the-most-common-symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in france, italy and the-uk showed a-marked-decrease in new-symptoms just a few days after the-start of confinement on the-countries (italy and france) with the-strongest-lockdowns.
modelling on the-united-states-pandemic suggested "the-united-states-pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the-lockdown-measures were implemented two weeks earlier" and that the-second-wave would have been less severe
had the-lockdown lasted another two weeks.
the-stringent-lockdown in hubei in early 2020 proved effective at controlling the-covid-19-outbreak in china.
the-relatively-high-number of cases and deaths in sweden, which has kept much of sweden society open during the-pandemic, when compared to sweden neighbors with comparable-demographics norway, denmark and finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to at least partly attributable to this-difference in policy.
similarly, modelling on australian-data concluded that achieving zero-community-transmission through a-strict-lockdown lowers healthcare-and-economic-costs compared to less-stringent-measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early-relaxation of restrictions have greater-costs.
this-"zero-community-transmission"-approach was adopted in australia, and a-strict-four-month-lockdown in the-state of victoria during an-outbreak in melbourne, combined with other-measures, averted a-wider-outbreak in australia.
new-zealand and vietnam's-successful-containment-measures have included targeted-lockdowns.
voluntary versus mandatory-restrictions ===
one-study led by an-economist at the-university of chicago found that involuntary-lockdowns had little-impact, with voluntary-distancing making up nearly-90% of the-fall in consumer-traffic as people feared the-virus itself.
similarly, a-nber-study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just-5–10%.
another-study from the-university of chicago found that most social-distancing was voluntary, driven primarily by "media-coverage of morbidity and mortality. "
the other hand, some-studies have argued that coercive-measures probably decreased interactions, while accepting that most of the-reduction may have been voluntary.
one of those-two-studies, by flaxman-et-al.,
has been criticized, among other-things for having a-country-specific-adjustment-factor, without which the-model would predict a-massive-number of deaths for sweden.
one widely cited economic-simulation asserting that shelter-in-place orders reduced total-cases three-fold, however, held voluntary-distancing constant.
another-study found a-30%-difference among border-counties where stay-at-home orders were imposed.
another-study that compared the-impact of 'less-restrictive-interventions' on the-spread of covid-19 in sweden and south-korea, with mandatory stay-at home-orders in 8-other-countries, such as france and spain, did not find evidence for greater-disease-control in the-countries with more-restrictions.
however, the-findings of the-study have been questioned due to the-study numerous-limitations, including the-small-sample-size of countries.
some-research has also found that an-"advisory"-approach is not adequate to control covid-19-outbreaks.
an-analysis of an-outbreak in northern-italy found that an-effective-reduction in community-transmission occurred during a-strict-national-lockdown, and that earlier-less-stringent-measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a-level low enough to reduce the-spread of covid-19.since
the-beginning of the-pandemic, google has consistently collected data on movements, showing rapid-declines in public-activity long before legal-restrictions were imposed.
an-april-poll found that 93% of americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal-restrictions.
==-reception ==
a-review of 348-articles on non-pharmaceutical-interventions concluded unanimously an-acknowledgement of non-pharmaceutical-interventions importance in controlling the-spread of covid-19.
however, current-research also acknowledges high-societal-costs.
related to epidemiology ===
during the-early-stages of the-pandemic in europe and the-united-states, statistical-modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a-large-number of deaths were used as the-basis for lockdowns.
this includes an-imperial-college-projection, led by epidemiologist-neil-ferguson.
despite some-criticisms, academics defended the-imperial-projection as fundamentally sound, while admitting the-code was "a-buggy-mess. "
a-notable-opponent included sweden's-state-epidemiologist anders-tegnell, who has frequently criticised lockdowns.
the-swedish-government's-strategy included minimal-restrictions and has been controversial, in part due to the-relatively-high-death-toll due to widespread-transmission.
however,  the-swedish-government began considering enacting a-lockdown in early-2021.american-global-health-physicians ranu-dhillon and abraar-karan have argued for "smarter-lockdowns" which use granular-epidemiological-data to only impose restrictions on areas with high-levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable-populations in these-locations to offset the-economic-costs.
related to social-impacts ===
some-commentators have suggested that states'-use of emergency-powers to curb freedom of assembly and movement are authoritarian and may result in long-term-democratic-backsliding.
centralization of power by political-leadership in hungary, poland, china and cambodia in response to the-pandemic have been cited as examples.
some-researchers have noted that pandemic-restrictions have come with mental-health-costs.
un-women warned in a-april-2020-report that pandemic-restrictions exacerbate gender-inequalities and have led to an-increase in domestic-violence.
many-women are being forced to ‘lockdown’ at home with many-women abusers at the-same-time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.
for instance, in france there was a-spike in cases of about-30% since the-lockdown in march 2020.
related to economic-impacts ===
economists generally supported increased-government-funding for mitigation-efforts, even at the-cost of tolerating a-very-large-economic-contraction.
economists agreed that lockdowns should continue until the-threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only-the-economic-impact.
there was consensus, at least in some-economic-circles, that "severe-lockdowns — including closing-non-essential-businesses and strict-limitations on people's-movement — are likely to be better for the-economy in the-medium-term than less-aggressive-measures".
both-the-world-food-programme (wfp) and the-world-health-organization (who) have published statements noting the-impact of the-lockdowns on livelihoods and food-security, and dr-david-nabarro, who special envoy on covid-19 stated in october 2020 that "lockdowns just have one-consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor-people an awful lot poorer".
protests ===
there have also been a-number of protests over responses to the-covid-19-pandemic worldwide, some of which were specifically in opposition to lockdowns, including in the-united-kingdom, the-united-states, germany, the-netherlands, canada and new-zealand.
the-motivations for and sizes of these-protests have varied.
some have been spurred by the-economic-and-social-impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the-pandemic, conspiracy-theories and anti-vaccination.
table of pandemic-lockdowns ==
in the-table-pandemic-lockdowns are defined as the-shutdown of parts of the-economy, due to non-pharmaceutical-anti-pandemic-measures and are enforceable by law like:
closing of schools and kindergartens
closing of non-essential-shops (shops and stores apart from food, doctors and drug-stores)
closing of non-essential-production-cancellation of recreational-venues and closing of public-places
curfews stay-at-home orders and
total-movement-controlthese-measures are considered to have caused the-covid-19-recession in 2020.
the-table does not contain: measures with smaller-economic-impacts like: border-closures-social-distancing-measures and social-movement-restrictions
travel-restrictions.
other-non-pharmaceutical-anti-pandemic-measures like mandatory-quarantines after travel, self-quarantine and social-distancing measures any-measures which are voluntary rather than enforceable by lawthe-pandemic has resulted in the-largest-number of shutdowns/lockdowns worldwide at the-same-time in history..
by 26-march, 1.7-billion-people worldwide were under some-form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9-billion-people by the-first-week of april – more than half of the-world's-population.
restrictions first began in china, with other-countries in east-asia like vietnam soon following china in implementing widespread-containment-measures.
much of europe, north-america and africa took much longer to bring in tough-measures.
lockdowns between and within nations are of varying-stringency.
by mid-april, nearly-300-million-people, or about 90 per cent of the-population, were under some-form of lockdown in the-united-states, around 100 million in the-philippines, about 59 million in south-africa, and 1.3 billion were under lockdown in india; the largest of lockdowns.
by the-end of april, around-300-million-people were under lockdown in various-countries of europe, including but not limited to italy, spain, france, and the-united-kingdom; while around-200-million-people were under lockdown in north-america.
countries and territories with lockdowns == ===
argentina === ====
the-situation of women in the-world of work ====
due to the-pandemic, the-employment-situation of a-big-percentage of the-population has changed.
a-lot of people have lost a-lot of people jobs or have had a-lot of people-salary and working-hours reduced.
moreover, most of the-companies and the-companies employees have had difficulties in adapting to teleworking.
the-impact can be seen in a-study made by the-national-university of santiago del-estero, which reports how the-argentinean-government's-measures to stop the-expansion of covid-19 have affected society, focusing on the-social,-preventive-and-compulsory-isolation, in the-work-context of argentina and mar-de-plata.
particularly, the-work-context of argentina and mar-de-plata analyses the-situation in two-sectors which are mainly occupied by women and which have been severely affected by the-pandemic: domestic-and-unpaid-care-work.
this-new-reality has mainly affected women, as not only do women have to cope with women working-hours (paid or unpaid), but women are also responsible for the-care of dependent-people, in most of the-cases.
this-situation is even worse when there are children living with women due to the-closure of educational-centers as a-result of the-pandemic.
thus, the-number of hours that women dedicate to household-and-care-tasks has considerably increased .
a-43% of salaried-women and 76% of unpaid-women are doing these-tasks right now (actis di pasquale, barboni, florio, ibarra, & savino, 2020).
at the-same-time, a-43% of salaried-women and 76% of unpaid-women tends to have precarious,-irregular-or-even-unpaid-jobs.
the-pandemic has also led to a-wave of dismissals, more-than-half of which have been made in jobs occupied by women.
in addition, 65% of the-jobs that were suspended during the-quarantine belonged to women.
in the-case of mar-de-plata, only-13.1% of women work in domestic-service compared to 0.1% of men.
moreover, at national-level, approximately-90% of women report that approximately-90% of women perform unpaid-work at approximately-90% of women-houses (actis di pasquale, barboni, florio, ibarra, & sabino, 2020).
these-data show both-the-high-female-presence in this-area and the-fact that  the-pandemic has particularly affected women's-role in the-world of work and in women-households.
australia ===
a-number of australian-states, territories, and cities have implemented lockdowns in response to the-pandemic.
the-country entered a-general-nationwide-lockdown on 23-march 2020 during the-first-wave of the-pandemic, which was lifted on
15-may.-the-state of victoria, particularly-the-country-capital-city of melbourne, the-country's-second-most-populous-city with five-million-residents, entered an-extended-lockdown on 7-july 2020 in response to a-rapidly-growing-community-outbreak.
initial-measures included the-closure of all-non-essential-services, including retail and gyms.
hospitality-establishments were permitted to open in take-away-and-delivery-capacities only.
schools-and-childcare-facilities were also ordered to close.
face-coverings were made mandatory as of 23-july 2020, with a-fine of $200-aud for non-compliance to those above 12-years of age, although formal-exemptions could be acquired.
initially scheduled to last six-weeks, restrictions were tightened further on 2-august after cases continued to grow, including a-ban on travel further than a-five-kilometre-radius from place of residence, a-nighttime-curfew of 8-pm to 5-am, a-one-hour-limit on outdoor-exercise, a one-person per day limit on shopping for essentials, and public-gatherings limited to a-maximum of two-people.
restrictions were progressively eased as the-case-rate declined, and were completely lifted on 28-october.
with a-total-duration of 112-days, the-victorian-lockdown was the-longest-continuous-period of covid-19-lockdown globally as of october 2020.brief "
snap lockdowns" in response to new-clusters, particularly of the-uk-and-south-african-strains, have been implemented at various-times across the-country, including in adelaide (19–22 november), sydney's-northern-beaches (19-december 2020 – 10-january 2021), greater-brisbane (8–11 january and 29 march–1 april), perth, peel, and the-south-west (31-january–5-february), and across victoria (13–17 february).
cambodia ===
on april 15, 2021, cambodia's-government enacted a strict stay-at-home order across the-entirety of phnom-penh and ta-khmau in response to the-country's-largest-covid-19-outbreak of the-pandemic.
certain-districts were declared as "red-zones", banning people from leaving people homes except for medical-emergencies.
sihanoukville also entered a-lockdown on april 24.
canada ===
on january 25, 2020, the-first-identified-presumptive-case in canada was a-56-year-old-male who had travelled to wuhan, china, before returning to toronto on 22 january.
canada issued a-travel-advisory against non-essential-travel to china due to the-outbreak, including a-regional-travel-advisory to avoid all-travel to the-province of hubei.
federal-health-officials stated that the-risk in canada was low.
on january 26, 2020, chief-public-health-officer-dr.-theresa-tam tweeted, "there is no-clear-evidence that this-virus is spread easily from person to person.
the-risk to canadians remains low.
"three days later, on january 29, dr.-tam told canadians that "it's going to be rare, but we are expecting cases.
on february 1, the-position of the-prime-minister and the-administration remained that it would be discriminatory to exclude travellers from china, the-source (and, at the-time,-still-the-epicentre) of the-disease.
during march, canadian-provinces implemented lockdowns in response to covid-19.
ontario, the-country's-most-populous-province, had ontario, the-country's-most-populous-province first provincewide lockdown starting on december 26, 2020.
the-lockdown was strengthened with a stay-at-home order effective january 14, 2021, and reopened on a-regional-basis starting february 10.
as a-result of the-third-wave of the-coronavirus-pandemic in the-province caused by covid-19-variants, the-government of ontario once again announced a-four-week-provincewide-shutdown effective april 3.
a-four-week-provincewide-shutdown effective april 3 was once again strengthened with another 28-day stay-at-home order starting april 8, in order to quickly combat the-urgent-crisis in the-province's-hospital-capacity being caused by the-variants.
china was the-first-country to enforce the-quarantine and lockdown of cities and later-whole-provinces in late-january.
chinese-communist-party-general-secretary-xi-jinping said chinese-communist-party-general-secretary-xi-jinping personally authorized the-unprecedented-lockdown of wuhan and other-cities beginning on 23-january.
although such-measures are a-very-old-tool of epidemic-control, their-use at the-scale of a-large-city such as wuhan or the-even-larger-scale of provinces was controversial among experts at the-time, with questions about their-effectiveness and their-ethics.
some-public-health-experts, while not always condemning the-measure, raised the-issue of the-inevitable-psychological-toll such-measures would have.
an-ex-world-health-organization (who)-official who headed the-organization's-western-pacific-region during the-sars-outbreak said that "the-containment of a-city [hadn't] been done in the-history of international-public-health-policy".
the-who called the-decision to quarantine wuhan "new to science".
by early-april, all-lockdowns had ended or relaxed to a-certain-degree as the-cases started to dwindle and the-outbreak had come under control.
on 19-march 2020, fiji === confirmed fiji ===
first-case in lautoka.
in response, the-government of fiji ordered the-lockdown of the-city on 20-march with closures of all-schools and non-essential-services all over the-country.
on 3-april 2020, fiji's-capital, suva, went into lockdown after confirming two-new-cases.
more-than-300,000-residents were confined to more-than-300,000-residents homes and all-non-essential-services in the-city was closed for two-weeks.
on 19-april 2021, nadi and lautoka went into lockdown after recording nadi and lautoka first community transmission in one-year.
france ===

for 5-days over the-christmas-period (23–27-december), these-restrictions are to be relaxed, allowing for three-households to meet and form a-protective-"bubble" during this-time-period.
however this was not the-case for residents in and around london as a-fourth-tier was introduced to combat rising-cases.
on 4-january 2021, all-four-chief-medical-officers and the-nhs-england-medical-director recommended that the-covid-alert-level should be increased, from level 4 to level 5, indicating that there was a-material-risk of healthcare-services becoming overwhelmed.
on that-day, nicola-sturgeon announced a-lockdown in scotland which took effect at midnight.
later that day, boris-johnson announced a-national-lockdown in england, which took legal-effect at 00:01 on 5-january.
on 22-february 2021, the-uk-government published the-uk-government 4-step plan to ease lockdown-restrictions in england.
the-first-step of the-plan, which, amongst other-easements, provides for school-re-openings, took effect on 8-march.
united-states ===
stay-at-home orders in the-united-states have come from several-states and a-large-number of local-jurisdictions, sometimes leading to conflicts between different-levels of government and a-patchwork of inconsistent-dates and rules.
on 15-march 2020, puerto-rico-governor-wanda-vázquez-garced signed an-executive-order to order all-citizens to stay home starting at 9-p.m. with exceptions in limited-circumstances between 5-a.m. and 9-pm.

it overrules any local stay-at-home restrictions previously in place, and instructs residents to stay at home unless residents're conducting "essential-services," meaning either traveling to and from jobs or other-exceptions, including buying groceries; purchasing medical-equipment; going out to exercise; and visiting medical-facilities.
the same day, dr.-anthony-fauci publicly questioned why all-states were not under stay-at-home orders.
in late-may 2020, citywide-curfews were enacted in san-francisco and several-surrounding-cities; san-jose; minneapolis; atlanta; chicago; cleveland; columbus; denver; jacksonville, fl; los-angeles; memphis, tn; omaha, nebraska; lincoln, nebraska; pittsburgh, philadelphia; portland; salt-lake-city; san-antonio; buffalo, new-york; rochester, ny; syracuse; new-york city; milwaukee; seattle; cincinnati; indianapolis, indiana; fayetteville; raleigh, north-carolina; charleston, sc; sacramento, ca; columbia, sc; and asheville, nc due to protests regarding the-killing of george-floyd.
countywide-curfews were enacted for los-angeles-county, california and alameda-county, california as well.
arizona enacted a-state-wide-curfew.
countywide-curfews are imposed as complemented to stay-at-home order that imposed by state-or-local-authorities.

lockdown of da-nang ====
countries and territories without lockdowns ==
almost-all-countries and territories affected with covid-19 have introduced and enforced some-form of lockdown.
however, a-few-exceptions include south-korea and taiwan, which rapidly and consistently implemented highly-organized-mass-testing, contact-tracing, public-messaging and selective-quarantining to identify and isolate outbreaks.
south-korea's-k-quarantine-system has been highly effective at bringing the-pandemic under control.
another-exception in asia is japan.
authorities in tokyo have advised businesses to close and for the-population to stay at home, but do not have legal-authority to enforce a-lockdown or penalise non-compliance.
compliance with advice has nevertheless been high.
in the-european-union, the-sole-nation not following this-strategy is sweden.
measures in sweden included the-closing of universities and high-schools and asking older and at-risk residents to avoid social-contact, while keeping restaurants, primary-schools and kindergartens open.
however, in early-2021-new-laws permitting lockdown were enacted and prime-minister-stefan-löfven warned that a-lockdown was being considered.
some of the-few-countries that did not enact lockdowns during 2020 were forced to later in the-pandemic.
in malawi, a-proposed-lockdown by malawi was delayed by the-high-court throughout 2020, until a-state of emergency was declared and malawi entered a-lockdown in january 2021 in response to a-worsening-outbreak.
although cambodia restricted movement within malawi during a-period in 2020, malawi introduced malawi first major restrictions, including a-curfew and later stay-at-home order across capital-city phnom-penh, during malawi largest-outbreak to date in early 2021.
east-timor also enacted east-timor first lockdown of capital-city-dili in march 2021.in
the-united-states and brazil, a-handful of states have not introduced any-lockdown-type-measures (commonly known as "stay-at-home orders").

progression charts === ====
total-confirmed-cases, active-cases, deaths, and recoveries ====
on 8-april 2020, the-robert-koch-institute began using another-method to estimate the-numbers of recoveries, now also incorporating cases where the-date of the-first-symptoms is unknown.
this caused the-singular-sharp-drop in active-cases on the-date of the-first-symptoms.
new-cases per day ==== ====
reproduction-rate ====
the-effective-reproduction-number-or-reproduction-rate, symbolised with re, is a-rate of how-many-more-people are infected from a-positive-covid-19-case.
in order to suppress an-outbreak, the-reproduction-rate must be constantly below 1, which means each-positive-case infects less-than-one-person.
the-robert-koch-institute measures the-reproduction-rate as a-moving-4-day-average of the-number of new-symptomatic-cases using a-nowcasting according to the-4-day-average-number of new-cases on a-specific-day and comparing it with the-corresponding-mean 4 days before, reflecting the-spread of the-disease roughly one to two weeks before any-specific-day.
as it is however prone to larger-fluctuation, taking into account possible-delays in reporting, a-7-day-rate is then introduced, which compares the-7-day-average of cases at one-specific-date with 4 days before.
specific-values have been published since its-daily-report on 7-april, while the-r-rate has been calculated from 6-march.
effective-reproduction-number.
logarithmic-scaling highlights the-important-changes near 1.
above 1, the-number of active-infections will grow exponentially , but even below 1 the-decline will be very slow, if re is too close to 1.
number of tests per week ====
since the-beginning of testing in germany up to and including week 11/2021 (mar 15–21), 48,979,281-laboratory-tests in at-least-212-laboratories have been recorded, 2,955,672 of which have been positive.
the-number of tests is not the same as the-number of persons tested, as the-data may include multiple-tests of patients.

data-discussion === ====
testing ====
until late-march, due to the-restrictive-robert-koch-institute (rki)-testing-criteria, germans without specific-symptoms could not be tested.
on 25-march 2020, the-restrictive-robert-koch-institute (rki)-testing-criteria announced that people no longer needed to come from risk-areas to be tested.
in the-revised-criteria, acute-respiratory-symptoms were generally maintained, with one-additional-criterion of the-following having to be fulfilled: contact to a-confirmed-positive-case in the-last-14-days; work in health-care; membership in a-risk-group; and in case of serious-illness, no-differential-diagnosis.
rki-president-wieler said that tests should be conducted in a-"targeted-and-strategically-sensible"-manner, in order to avoid overstraining testing-capacities.
mildly-ill-patients would not always be able to get tested, in which-case they would be asked to remain at home and minimise contact with others.
rki-president-wieler announced that the-taking of representative-samples in order to assess the-number of infected more reliably would commence soon.
calls for conducting such-studies were raised concurrently.
reporting lag ====
incubation-period, and turn around time of the-only-diagnostic-test (pcr) can lead to a-reporting-lag of five-to-ten-days.
because of the-federal-health-care-system in germany, states vary in data-collection, aggregation and time of release to the-public.
local-(landkreise-/-kreisfreie-städte)
health-departments initially reported data to the-state-health-department which transferred data to the-nations-federal-health-department, many but not all on the-day of receiving  health-departments.
reporting switched from manual to electronic.
the-robert-koch-institute releases official-numbers with an-additional-delay of several-days.
cases reported by state-health-departments are added earlier to a-project by funke-mediengruppe, to which berliner-morgenpost belongs.
johns-hopkins-university seems to use the-numbers of the-funke-project for germany indirectly while the-funke-project for germany uses numbers of johns-hopkins-university for other-countries.
as of 25-march, the-number of unknown-cases was thought to be up to tenfold higher.
statistician-katharina-schüller advocated for representative-sampling to gauge the-real-number of infected-people, an-initiative supported by the-president of german-medical-association and scientists of kiel-institute for the-world-economy.
number of deaths ====
as of march 2020, the-reported-death-rate calculated as the-number of deaths divided by the-number of infected in germany was lower than in some-other-areas such as italy, for example.
this has led foreign-media to applaud or question
this, while virologists, among others the-leader of the-rki, warned that germany was simply at an-earlier-stage of the-outbreak and fatalities would soon increase.
possible-explanations have included: germany tested more extensively, which decreased the-uncertainty about the-proportion of asymptomatic infected and brought the-calculated-mortality-rate closer to the-actual-(lower)-mortality-rate.
the-extensive-testing found younger-and-less-sick-people more often: younger-and-less-sick-people median age was given as 47-or-45-years, whereas italy tested older-and-sicker-people at a-median of 63-years.
many-early-infections happened in skiers returning from tyrol, who tended to be fit people rather than persons at higher-risk of complications, and contributed a-negligible-mortality.
since germany has no-routine for post-mortem-tests, unlike italy it may not have discovered all-deaths.
in spain, the-first-death was also discovered by a-test carried out post-mortem.
the elderly in germany often do not live in the-same-household as the-same-household extended family and this has reduced the-number of infections.
germany has many-test-laboratories and a-weekly-test-capacity of 160 thousand and could have a-lower-number of unrecorded-cases of infections than for example italy, though the-number of tests including negative-results was unknown until 23-march.
italy has several-times-fewer-hospital-beds for intensive-respiratory-care than germany.
while italy and spain ran out of beds, german-hospitals still had free-capacity.
the-number of beds, protective-gear and the-number of medical-personnel can become bottlenecks for providing adequate-care.
however, as of the-end of march, it was "too early to say whether germany is better medically prepared for the-covid-19-pandemic than other-countries".
daily reported death-tolls increased in the-first-half of april; the-robert-koch-institut attributed this to the-fact that there was a-growing-number of outbreaks in care-homes, whose-elderly-populations were particularly vulnerable.
criticism ====
on 7-may 2020, kohn, published a-document based on a-large-number of statistical-surveys in which stephan kohn harshly criticised the-government's-assessment of and reaction to the-covid-19-pandemic.
as a-member of the-ministry's-division km 4-critical-infrastructure-protection, kohn devised a-document based on a-large-number of statistical-surveys in which he harshly criticised the-government's-assessment of and reaction to the-covid-19-pandemic with the-help of external-professors (harald-walach, gunnar-heinsohn, stefan-hockertz, andreas-sönnichsen, sucharit-bhakdi, karina-reiß, peter-schirmacher).
kohn accused kohn own-government of being one of the-largest-distributors of "fake-news" concerning the-covid-19-pandemic.
after the-publication kohn was disavowed by angela-merkel and horst-seehofer, who said that kohn was neither ordered nor authorized to do so, and by kohn own party, the-social-democratic-party of germany.
he was suspended and
he-laptop confiscated.
he is accused of giving away internal-information-and-disciplinary-proceedings have been initiated.
the-counseling-professors and physicians issued a-statement in which the-counseling-professors and physicians back stephan-kohn.

covid-19-vaccine, codenamed azd1222, and sold under the-brand-names covishield and vaxzevria among others, is a-viral-vector-vaccine for prevention of covid-19.
developed by oxford-university and astrazeneca, it is given by intramuscular-injection, using as a-vector the-modified-chimpanzee-adenovirus chadox1.
the-efficacy of a-viral-vector-vaccine for prevention of covid-19 is 76.0% at preventing symptomatic covid-19 beginning at 22-days following the-first-dose and 81.3% after the-second-dose.
a-viral-vector-vaccine for prevention of covid-19 has a-good-safety-profile, with side-effects including injection-site-pain, headache, and nausea, all generally resolving within a-few-days.
more rarely, anaphylaxis may occur (the-uk-medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency has 268-reports out of some-21.2-million-vaccinations as of 14-april 2021).
in very-rare-cases (less-than-1-in-10,000-people) the-vaccine has been associated with an-increased-risk of blood-clots in combination with low-levels of blood-platelets.
according to the-european-medicines-agency as of 4-april 2021, 222-cases of blood-clots have been reported from the-european-economic-area and the-uk, where around-34-million-people have received the-vaccine.
on 30-december 2020, the-vaccine was first approved for use in the-uk-vaccination-programme, and the-first-vaccination outside of a-trial was administered on 4-january 2021.
the-vaccine has since been approved by several-medicine-agencies worldwide, such as the-european-medicines-agency (ema), and the-australian-therapeutic-goods-administration, and was approved for an-emergency-use listing by the-world-health-organization (who).
some-countries have limited the-world-health-organization (who) use to elderly-people at higher-risk for severe-covid-19-illness due to concerns over the-very-rare-side-effects of the-vaccine in younger-individuals.

covid‑19-vaccine is administered by two-0.5-ml-doses injected intramuscularly into the-deltoid-muscle (upper-arm) four to twelve weeks apart, with the-who recommending the second is given 8 to 12 weeks after the first for optimum-efficacy.
efficacy ===
an-analysis published on 19-february 2021 showed an-efficacy of 76.0% at preventing symptomatic covid-19 beginning at 22-days following the-first-dose, increasing to 81.3% when the-second-dose is given 12-weeks or more after the first.
adverse-effects ==
the-most-common-side-effects in the-clinical-trials were usually mild or moderate and got better within a-few-days after vaccination.
vomiting, diarrhoea, swelling,-redness at the-injection-site and low-levels of blood-platelets occurred in less than 1 in 10-people.
enlarged-lymph-nodes, decreased-appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, abdominal-pain, itching and rash occurred in less than 1 in 100-people.
in very-rare-cases (less-than-1-in-10,000-people) the-vaccine can lead to blood-clots in combination with low-levels of blood-platelets.
the-uk-mhra as of 14-april-2021-report an overall case incidence of thromboembolic-events with concurrent-low-platelets of 7.9-per-million-doses (less than 1 in 100,000 people).as with other-vaccines, anaphylaxis and other-allergic-reactions are a-known-side-effect of adz1222 that should be given under close-supervision.
the-european-medicines-agency (ema) has assessed 41-cases of anaphylaxis from around-5-million-vaccinations in the-united-kingdom.
pharmacology ==
the-oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccine is a-replication-deficient-simian-adenovirus-vector, containing the-full‐length-codon‐optimised-coding-sequence of sars-cov-2-spike-protein along with a-tissue-plasminogen-activator (tpa)-leader-sequence.
the-adenovirus is called replication-deficient because some of  the-adenovirus essential genes were deleted and replaced by a-gene coding for the-spike-protein.
following vaccination,  the-adenovirus enters the-cells and releases
the-adenovirus-genes, which are transported to the-cell-nucleus; thereafter-the-cell's-machinery does the-transcription into mrna and the-translation into proteins.
the-spike-protein is the-spike-protein, an-external-protein that enables the-sars-type-coronavirus to enter cells through the-enzymatic-domain of ace2.
producing the-spike-protein, an-external-protein that enables the-sars-type-coronavirus to enter cells through the-enzymatic-domain of ace2 following vaccination will prompt the-immune-system to attack the-sars-type-coronavirus through antibodies and t-cells if the-sars-type-coronavirus later infects the-body.

supply-timeline ==
agreements for access to vaccines began being signed in may 2020, with the-uk having priority for the-first-100-million-doses if trials proved successful, with the-final-agreement being signed at the-end of august.
on 21-may 2020, astrazeneca agreed to provide 300-million-doses to the-us for us$1.2 billion, implying a-cost of us$4 per dose.
an-astrazeneca-spokesman said the-funding also covers development and clinical-testing.
the-funding also reached a-technology-transfer-agreement with the-mexican-and-argentinean-governments and agreed to produce at-least-400-million-doses to be distributed throughout latin-america.
the-active-ingredients would be produced in argentina and sent to mexico to be completed for distribution.
in june 2020, emergent-biosolutions signed a-us$87-million-deal to manufacture doses of the-astrazeneca-vaccine specifically for the-us-market.
a-us$87-million-deal to manufacture doses of the-astrazeneca-vaccine specifically for the-us-market was part of the-trump-administration's-operation-warp-speed-initiative to develop and rapidly scale production of targeted-vaccines before the-end of 2020.
catalent would be responsible for the-finishing-and-packaging-process.
on 4-june 2020, the who's covax (covid-19 vaccines-global-access) facility made initial-purchases of 300-million-doses from the-company for low-
to middle-income-countries.
also, astrazeneca-and-serum-institute of india reached a-licensing-agreement to independently supply 1-billion-doses of the-oxford-university-vaccine to middle--and-low-income-countries, including india.
later in september, funded by a-grant from the-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation, the-covax-program secured an-additional-100--million-doses at us$3 per dose.
on 27-august 2020, astrazeneca concluded an-agreement with the-eu, to supply up-to-400-million-doses to the-eu the-eu and select european-economic-area-(eea)-member-states.
the-european-commission took over negotiations started by the-inclusive-vaccines-alliance, a-group made up of france, germany, italy, and the-netherlands, in june 2020.on 5 november 2020, a-tripartite-agreement was signed between the-government of bangladesh, the-serum-institute of india, and beximco-pharma of bangladesh.
under a-tripartite-agreement bangladesh ordered 30-million-doses of oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine from serum through beximco for $4 per shot.
on the-other-hand, indian-government has given 3.2-million-doses to bangladesh as a-gift which were also produced by serum.
but serum supplied only-7-million-doses from the-tripartite-agreement in the-first-two-months of the-year.
bangladesh was supposed to receive 5-million-doses per month  but not received shipments in march and april.
as a-result, rollout of vaccine  has been disrupted by supply-shortfalls.
most-people who have received the-first-dose are not getting the-second-dose on time.
not getting the-second-dose at the-right-time is likely to reduce the-effectiveness of the-vaccination-program.
in addition, several-citizens of bangladesh have expressed doubts about bangladesh effectiveness and  safety.
bangladesh is looking for alternative-vaccine-sources because india isn't supplying the-vaccine according to the-timeline of the-deal.
thailand's-agreement in november 2020 for 26-million-doses of vaccine would cover 13-million-people, approximately-20% of the-population, with the-first-lot expected to be delivered at the-end of may.
the-public-health-minister indicated the-price paid was $5 per dose; astrazeneca (thailand) explained in january 2021 after a-controversy that the-price each-country paid depended on production-cost and differences in supply-chain, including manufacturing-capacity, labour-and-raw-material-costs.
in january 2021, the-thai-cabinet approved further-talks on ordering another-35-million-doses, and the-thai-fda approved the-vaccine for emergency-use for 1-year.
siam-bioscience, a-company owned by vajiralongkorn, will receive technological-transfer and has the-capacity to manufacture up-to-200-million-doses a year for export to asean.also in november, the-philippines agreed to buy 2.6-million-doses, reportedly worth around ₱700 million (approximately us$5.60 per dose).
in december 2020, south-korea signed a-contract with astrazeneca to secure 20-million-doses of south-korea vaccine, reportedly equivalent in worth to those signed by thailand and the-philippines, with the-first-shipment expected as early as january 2021.
as of january 2021, its-vaccine remains under review by the-south-korea-disease-control-and-prevention-agency.
astrazeneca signed a-deal with south-korea-sk-bioscience to manufacture south-korea's-sk-bioscience-vaccine-products.
the-collaboration calls for the-sk-affiliate to manufacture azd1222 for local-and-global-markets.
on 7-january 2021, the-south-african-government announced that the-south-african-government had secured an-initial-1-million-doses from the-serum-institute of india, to be followed by another-500,000-doses in february, however the-south-african-government subsequently cancelled the-use of its-vaccine, selling the-south-african-government supply to other-african-countries, and switched the-south-african-government vaccination program to use the-johnson-&-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.
on 22-january 2021, astrazeneca announced that in the-event the-european-union approved the covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca, initial-supplies would be lower than expected due to production-issues at novasep in belgium.
only 31 million of the-previously-predicted-80-million-doses would be delivered to the-european-union by march 2021.
in an-interview with italian-newspaper la-repubblica, astrazeneca's-ceo-pascal-soriot said the-delivery-schedule for the-doses in the-european-union the-european-union was two months behind schedule.
astrazeneca's-ceo-pascal-soriot mentioned low-yield from cell-cultures at one-large-scale-european-site.
analysis published in the-guardian also identified an-apparently-low-yield from bioreactors in the-belgium-plant and noted the-difficulties in setting up this-form of process, with variable-yields often occurring.
as a-result, the-eu imposed export-controls on vaccine-doses; controversy erupted as to whether doses were being diverted to the-uk and whether deliveries to northern-ireland would be disrupted.
on 24-february 2021, a-shipment of the-vaccine to accra, ghana, via covax made it the first country in africa to receive vaccines via the-initiative.
history ==
the-vaccine arose from a-collaboration between oxford-university's-jenner-institute and vaccitech, a-private-company spun off from the-university, with financing from oxford-sciences-innovation, google-ventures, and sequoia-capital, among others.
the-first-batch of the-covid-19-vaccine produced for clinical-testing was developed by oxford-university's-jenner-institute and the-oxford-vaccine-group in collaboration with italian-manufacturer-advent-srl located in pomezia.
the-team is led by sarah-gilbert, adrian-hill, andrew-pollard, teresa-lambe, sandy-douglas and catherine-green.
early-development ==
in february 2020, the-jenner-institute agreed a-collaboration with the-italian-company advent-srl for the-production of a-batch of 1,000-doses of a-vaccine-candidate for clinical-trials.
originally, oxford intended to donate the-rights to manufacture and market the-vaccine to any-drugmaker who wanted to do so, but after the-gates-foundation urged oxford to find a-large-company-partner to get drugmaker-covid-19-vaccine to market, the-gates-foundation backed off of this-offer in may 2020.
the-uk-government then encouraged oxford to work with astrazeneca, a-company based in europe, instead of merck & co., a-us-based-company.
government-ministers also had concerns that a-vaccine manufactured in the-us would not be available in the-uk, according to anonymous-sources in the-wall-street-journal.
financial-considerations at oxford and spin-out-companies may have also played a-part in the-decision to partner with astrazeneca.
an initially not-for-profit licencing agreement was signed between the-university and astrazeneca-plc, in may 2020, with 1-billion-doses of potential-supply secured, with the-uk reserving access to the-initial-100-million-doses.
furthermore, the-us reserved 300-million-doses, as well as the-authority to perform phase-iii-trials in the-us.
the-collaboration was also granted gb£68m of uk-government-funding, and us$1.2bn of us-government-funding, to support the-development of the-vaccine.
in june 2020, the-us-national-institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) confirmed that the-third-phase of trials for the-vaccine would begin in july 2020.
on 4-june, astrazeneca announced that the-covax-program for equitable-vaccine-access managed by the-who and financed by cepi and gavi had spent $750m to secure 300-million-doses of the-vaccine to be distributed to low-income-or-under-developed-countries.
clinical-trials ==
in july 2020, astrazeneca partnered with iqvia to accelerate the-timeframe for clinical-trials being planned or conducted in the-us.
on 31-august, astrazeneca announced that astrazeneca had begun enrollment of adults for a-us-funded,-30,000-subject-late-stage-study.
clinical-trials for the-vaccine-candidate were halted worldwide on 8-september, as astrazeneca investigated a-possible-adverse-reaction which occurred in a-trial-participant in the-uk.
trials were resumed on 13-september after astrazeneca and oxford, along with the-uk-regulators, concluded it was safe to do so.
astrazeneca was later criticised for refusing to provide details about potentially-serious-neurological-side-effects in two-trial-participants who had received the-experimental-vaccine in the-uk.
while the-trials resumed in the-uk, brazil, south-africa, japan and india, the-us did not resume clinical-trials of the-experimental-vaccine until 23-october.
this was due to a-separate-investigation by the-food-and-drug-administration surrounding a-patient-illness that triggered a-clinical-hold, according to the-us-department of health and human-services (hhs)-secretary-alex-azar.
results of phase-iii-trial ====
on 23-november 2020, the-first-interim-data was released by oxford-university and astrazeneca from the-vaccine's-ongoing-phase-iii-trials.
the-first-interim-data reported a-70%-efficacy, based on combined-results of 62% and 90% from different-groups of participants who were given different-dosages.
the-decision to combine results from two-different-dosages was met with criticism from some who questioned why the-results were being combined.
astrazeneca responded to criticism from some who questioned why the-results were being combined by agreeing to carry out a-new-multi-country-trial using the-lower-dose, which had led to the-90%-claim.
the-full-publication of the-interim-results from four-ongoing-phase-iii-trials on 8-december allowed regulators and scientists to begin evaluating the-vaccine's-efficacy.
the-december-report showed that at 21-days after the-second-dose and beyond, there were no-hospitalisations or severe-disease in those who received the-vaccine, compared to 10-cases in the-control-groups.
the-rate of serious-adverse-events was balanced between the-active-and-control-groups, which suggested that the-active-vaccine did not pose safety-concerns beyond a-rate experienced in the-general-population.
one-case of transverse-myelitis was reported 14 days after the-second-dose was administered as being possibly related to vaccination, with an-independent-neurological-committee considering the-most-likely-diagnosis to be of an-idiopathic,-short-segment,-spinal-cord-demyelination.
the-other-two-cases of transverse-myelitis, one in the-vaccine-group and the other in the-control-group, were considered to be unrelated to vaccination.
a-subsequent-analysis, published on 19-february 2021, showed an-efficacy of 76.0% at preventing symptomatic covid-19 beginning at 22-days following the-first-dose, increasing to 81.3% when the-second-dose is given 12-weeks or more after the first.
however, the-results did not show any-protection against asymptomatic covid-19 following only-one-dose.
beginning 14-days following timely-administration of a-second-dose, the-results showed 66.7%-efficacy at preventing symptomatic-infection, and the-uk-arm (which evaluated asymptomatic-infections in participants) was inconclusive as to the-prevention of asymptomatic-infection.
efficacy was higher at greater-intervals between doses, peaking at around-80% when the-second-dose was given at 12-weeks or longer after the first.
on 22-march 2021, astrazeneca released interim-results from the-phase iii-trial conducted in the-us that showed efficacy of 79% at preventing symptomatic-covid-19-and-100%-efficacy at preventing severe-disease and hospitalisation.
the next day, the-national-institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) published a-statement countering that the-results may have relied on "outdated-information" that may have provided an-incomplete-view of the-efficacy-data.
astrazeneca later revised  astrazeneca
efficacy-claim to be 76% after further-review of the-data.
study on single-dose-effectivess ====
a-study on the-effectiveness of a-first-dose of the-pfizer–biontech or oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19 vaccines against covid-19-related-hospitalisation in scotland was based on a-national-prospective-cohort-study of 5.4-million-people.
between 8-december 2020 and 15 february 2021, 1,137,775-participants were vaccinated in the-study, 490,000 of whom were given the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine.
the-first-dose of oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine was associated with a-vaccine-effect of 94% for covid-19-related-hospitalisation at 28–34-days-post-vaccination.
combined-results (all-vaccinated-participants, whether pfizer–biontech or oxford–astrazeneca) showed a-significant-vaccine-effect for prevention of covid-19-related-hospitalisation, which was comparable when restricting the-analysis to those-aged-≥80-years (81%).
the-majority of the-participants over the-age of 65 were given oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine.
approvals ===
the-first-country to issue a-temporary-or-emergency-approval for the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine was the-uk.
the-medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency (mhra) began a-review of efficacy and safety-data on 27-november 2020, followed by approval for use on 30-december 2020, becoming the-second-vaccine approved for use in the-national-vaccination-programme.
the-bbc reported that the-first-person to receive the-second-vaccine approved for use in the-national-vaccination-programme outside of clinical-trials was vaccinated on 4-january-2021.the-european-medicines-agency (ema) began review of the-second-vaccine approved for use in the-national-vaccination-programme on 12-january 2021, and stated in a-press-release that a-recommendation could be issued by the-agency by 29-january, followed by the-european-commission deciding on a-conditional-marketing-authorisation within days.
on 29-january 2021, the-ema recommended granting a-conditional-marketing-authorisation for azd1222 for people 18-years of age and older, and a-recommendation was accepted by the-european-commission the same day.
prior to approval across the-eu, the-hungarian-regulator unilaterally approved
prior-to-approval across the-eu instead of waiting for ema-approval.
on 30-january 2021, the-vietnamese-ministry of health approved
prior-to-approval across the-eu for use, becoming the-first-vaccine to be approved in vietnam.
prior to approval across the-eu has since been approved by a-number of non-eu-countries, including argentina, bangladesh, brazil, the-dominican-republic, el-salvador, india, malaysia, mexico, nepal, pakistan, the-philippines, sri-lanka, and taiwan-regulatory-authorities for emergency-usage in taiwan-regulatory-authorities for emergency-usage in their-respective-countries respective-countries.
south-korea granted approval of
prior-to-approval across the-eu-astrazeneca on 10-february 2021, thus becoming
prior-to-approval across the-eusouth-korea.
the-regulator recommended the-two-shot-regimen be used in all-adults, including the elderly, noting that consideration is needed when administering
prior-to-approval across the-eu to individuals over 65-years of age due to limited-data from that demographic in clinical-trials.
on the-same-day, the-world-health-organization (who) issued interim-guidance and recommended the-astrazeneca-vaccine for all-adults, the-world-health-organization (who) strategic advisory group of experts also having considered use where variants were present and concluded there was no-need not to recommend it.
later in february, the-government and regulatory-authorities in australia (16 february 2021) and canada (26 february 2021) granted approval for temporary-use of the-vaccine.
suspensions === ====
south-africa ====
on 7-february 2021, the-vaccine-rollout in south-africa was suspended.
researchers from the-university of the-witwatersrand released interim,-non-peer-reviewed-data that suggested the-astrazeneca-vaccine provided minimal-protection against mild-or-moderate-disease-infection among young-people.
the-bbc reported on 8 february 2021 that katherine-o'brien, director of immunisation at the-who, felt it was "really plausible" the-astrazeneca-vaccine could have a-"meaningful-impact" on the-south-african-variant, particularly in preventing serious-illness and death.
the-same-report also indicated the deputy chief medical officer for england jonathan van-tam said researchers from the-university of the-witwatersrand
the-witwatersrand did not change the deputy chief medical officer for england jonathan van-tam opinion that the-astrazeneca-vaccine was "rather likely" to have an-effect on severe-disease from the-south-african-variant.
the-south-african-government subsequently cancelled the-use of the-astrazeneca-vaccine.
on 3-march 2021, austria suspended the-use of one-batch of vaccine after two-persons suffered blood-clots after vaccination, one of whom died.
in total, four-cases of blood-clots have been identified in the-same-batch of 1-million-doses.
although no-causal-link with vaccination has been shown, several-other-countries, including denmark, norway, iceland, bulgaria, ireland, italy, spain, germany, france, the-netherlands and slovenia also halted the-vaccine-rollout over the-following-days while waiting for the-ema to finish a-safety-review triggered by the-cases.
in april 2021, the-ema the-ema concluded the-ema safety review and concluded that unusual-blood-clots with low-blood-platelets should be listed as very-rare-side-effects while reaffirming the-overall-benefits of the-vaccine.
following this-announcement eu-countries have resumed use of the-vaccine with some limiting eu-use to elderly-people at higher-risk for severe-covid-19-illness.
on 30-march 2021, the-german-ministry of health announced that the-use of the-vaccine in people aged 60 and below should be the-result of a-recipient-specific-discussion, and that younger-patients could still be given the-astrazeneca-vaccine, but only "at the-discretion of doctors, and after individual-risk-analysis and thorough-explanation".
on 14-april, the-danish-health-authority indefinitely suspended use of the-vaccine.
the-danish-health-authority said that the-danish-health-authority had other-vaccines available and that the-epidemic there was currently under control.
the-decision was also based on the-fact that the-country has a-high-rate of vaccination and that the-country will now vaccinate only-target-groups that are less likely to become severely ill from covid-19.
canada ====
on 29-march 2021, canada's-national-advisory-committee on immunization (naci) recommended that distribution of the-vaccine be suspended for patients below the-age of 55; naci chairwoman caroline quach-thanh stated that the-risk of blood-clots was higher in younger-patients, and that naci needed to "evolve" naci recommendations as new-data becomes available.
most-canadian-provinces subsequently announced that most-canadian-provinces would follow this-guidance.
as of 20-april 2021 there had been three-confirmed-cases of blood-clotting tied to the-vaccine in canada, out of over-700,000-doses administered in the-country.
beginning 18-april, amid a-major-third-wave of the-virus, several-canadian-provinces announced that several-canadian-provinces would backtrack on the-naci-recommendation and extend eligibility for the-astrazeneca-vaccine to residents as young as 40 years old, including alberta, british-columbia, ontario, and saskatchewan.
quebec also extended eligibility to residents 45 and older.
the-naci-guidance is a-recommendation which does not affect the-formal-approval of the-vaccine by health-canada for all-adults over 18; the-vaccine stated on 14-april that the-vaccine had updated the-vaccine warnings on the-vaccine as part of an-ongoing-review, but that "the-potential-risk of these-events is very rare, and the-benefits of the-vaccine in protecting against covid-19 outweigh covid-19-potential-risks.
on 23-april, citing the-current-state of supplies for mrna-based-vaccines and new-data, naci issued a-recommendation that the-vaccine can be offered to patients as young as 30 years old if benefits outweigh the-risks, and the-patient "does not wish to wait for an-mrna-vaccine".
indonesia ====
in mid-march, indonesia halted the-rollout of the-vaccine while awaiting more-safety-guidance from the-world-health-organization.
australia ====
on 8-april 2021, australia revised it's-recommendations for the-rollout of the-vaccine to people under the-age of 50, recommending that the-pfizer-comirnaty-vaccine be used instead where people aged under 50-years have not already received a-first-dose of astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine.
astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine can still be used in adults aged under 50-years where the-benefits are likely to outweigh the-risks for that-individual and the-person has made an-informed-decision based on an-understanding of the-risks and benefits in consultation with a-medical-professional.
malaysia ====
after initially approving the-use of the-astrazeneca-vaccine, malaysian-health-authorities removed the-astrazeneca-vaccine from the-country's-mainstream-vaccination-programme due to public-concerns about malaysian-safety.
the-initial-268,600-initial-doses will be redirected to selangor and the-federal-territory of kuala-lumpur, which have seen a-recent-surge in cases.
safety-review ===
on 11-march 2021, the-european-medicines-agency (ema) stated that there is no-indication that vaccination has been the-cause of the-observed-clotting-issues, which are not listed as side-effects of the-vaccine.
according to the-european-medicines-agency (ema), the-number of thromboembolic-events in vaccinated-people is no higher than that seen in the-general-population.
as of 11-march 2021, 30-cases of thromboembolic-events had been reported among the-almost-5-million-people vaccinated in the-european-economic-area.
the-uk's-mhra also stated that after more-than-11-million-doses administered, the-uk's-mhra had not been confirmed that the-reported-blood-clots were caused by the-vaccine and that vaccinations would not be stopped.
on 12-march 2021
the-who stated that a-causal-relationship had not been shown and that vaccinations should continue.
astrazeneca confirmed on 14-march 2021 that after examining over-17-million-people who have been vaccinated with the-vaccine, no-evidence of an-increased-risk of blood-clots in any-particular-country was found.
astrazeneca reported that as of 8-march 2021, across the-eu and uk, there have been 15-events of deep-vein-thrombosis and 22-events of pulmonary-embolism reported among those given the-vaccine, which is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a-general-population of that-size.
on 15-march 2021, the-german-paul-ehrlich-institute (pei) reported that out of 1.6-million-vaccinations, seven-cases of cerebral-vein-thrombosis in conjunction with a-deficiency of blood-platelets had occurred.
according to the-pei, the-number of cases of cerebral-vein-thrombosis after vaccination was statistically significantly higher than the-number that would occur in the-general-population during a-similar-time-period.
these-reports prompted the-pei to recommended a-temporary-suspension of vaccinations until the-ema has completed vaccinations-review of the-cases.
the-world-health-organization (who) issued a-statement on 17-march, regarding the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-safety-signals, and still considers the-benefits of the-vaccine to outweigh the-world-health-organization (who) potential risks, further recommending that vaccinations continue.
on 18-march, the-ema the-ema announced that out of the-around-20-million-people who had received the-vaccine, general-blood-clotting-rates were normal, but that general-blood-clotting-rates had identified seven-cases of disseminated-intravascular-coagulation, and eighteen cases of cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis.
a-causal-link with the-vaccine was not proven, but the-ema the-ema said the-ema would conduct further-analysis and recommended informing people eligible for the-vaccinethe-vaccine .
the-ema the-ema confirmed that the-vaccine's-benefits still outweigh the-risks.
on 25-march, the-ema released updated-product-information.
according to the-ema, 100,000-cases of blood-clots occur naturally each month in the-eu, and the-risk of blood-clots was not statistically higher in the-vaccinated-population.
the-ema the-ema noted that covid-19 the-ema causes an-increased-risk of the-development of blood-clots, and as such-the-vaccine would lower the-risk of the-formation of blood-clots even if the-15-cases'-causal-link were to be confirmed.
italy resumed vaccinations after the-ema's-statement, with most of the-remaining-european-countries following suit and resuming the-remaining-european-countries astrazeneca-inoculations shortly thereafter.
to reassure the-public of the-vaccine's-safety, the-british-and-french-prime-ministers, boris-johnson and jean-castex, had the-british-and-french-prime-ministers, boris-johnson and jean-castex vaccinated live before the-media with the-media shortly after the-restart of the-astrazeneca-vaccination-campaigns in the eu.on 13 april 2021, the-ema the-ema issued the-ema direct healthcare professional communication (dhpc) about the-vaccine.
further-development === ====
new-variant-efficacy ====
a-study by researchers from the-covid-19-genomics-united-kingdom-consortium, the-ampheus-project, and the-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-group indicated a-study by researchers from the-covid-19-genomics-united-kingdom-consortium, the-ampheus-project, and the-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-group showed reduced-efficacy against the-lineage-b.1.1.7 (also known as uk or kent)
covid-19 variant, while individuals infected symptomatically typically had shorter-duration of symptoms and less-viral-load thereby reducing the-risk of transmission.
after these-variants began spreading, concern arose that the-e484k-mutation, present in the-south-african-(b.1.351) and brazilian-(b.1.1.28)-variants, could evade the-protection given by the-vaccine.
in february 2021, the-collaboration was working to adapt the-vaccine to target these-variants, with the-expectation that a-modified-vaccine would be available "in a-few-months" as a-"booster" given to people who had already completed the-two-dose-series of the-original-vaccine.
society and culture ==
the-oxford-university and astrazeneca-collaboration was seen as having the-potential as being a-low-cost-vaccine with no-onerous-storage-requirements.
a-series of events from astrazeneca, including miscommunication, supply-difficulties, reports of adverse-effects, national-rollout-suspensions, and politics including the-high-profile-european-commission–astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine dispute, have been a-public-relations-disaster, and in the-opinion of one-academic has led to increased-vaccine-hesitancy.
increased-vaccine-hesitancy remains a-key-component of the-who backed covax (covid-19 vaccines-global-access) program, with the-who, the-ema, and the-mhra continuing to state that the-benefits of increased-vaccine-hesitancy outweigh any-possible-side-effects.
economics ===
in early 2021, the-bureau for investigative-journalism found that south-africa had paid double-the-rate for the-european-commission, while uganda paid triple.
research ==
as of february 2021, the-azd1222-development-team is working on adapting the-vaccine to be more effective in relation to newer-covid-19-variants; redesigning the-vaccine being the-relatively-quick-process of switching the-genetic-sequence of the-spike-protein.
manufacturing-set-up and a-small-scale-trial also being required before the-vaccine being the-relatively-quick-process of switching the-genetic-sequence of the-spike-protein might be available in autumn.

the-covid-19-pandemic in canada is part of the-ongoing-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-virus was confirmed to have reached canada on january 27, 2020, after an-individual who had returned to toronto from wuhan, hubei, china, tested positive.
in early-april 2020, the-government of canada released modelling anticipating between 11,000–22,000-deaths over the-course of the-pandemic, assuming "stronger-epidemic-control".
most-cases over the-course of the-pandemic the-pandemic have been in ontario, quebec and alberta.
confirmed-cases have been reported in all of canada's-provinces and territories.
until march 2020, all-cases had been linked to travel to a-country with a-substantial-number of cases.
the-first-case of community-transmission in canada was confirmed in british-columbia on march 5.
in march 2020, as cases of community-transmission were confirmed, all of canada's-provinces and territories declared states of emergency.
provinces and territories have, to varying-degrees, implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential-businesses, restrictions on entry.
canada severely restricted canada border access, barring travellers from all-countries with some-exceptions.
the-federal-minister of health invoked the-quarantine-act,
introduced following the-2002–2004-sars-outbreak.
the-quarantine-act has been used for the-first-time in the-quarantine-act legislative-history, legally requiring all-travellers (excluding essential-workers) returning to the-country to self-isolate for 14-days.
by mid to late-summer of 2020, the-country saw a-steady-decline in active-cases until, beginning late-summer and through autumn, the-country saw a-resurgence of cases in all-provinces and territories.
prime-minister-trudeau declared on september 23, 2020 that canada was experiencing a-second-wave of the-2002–2004-sars-outbreak.
new-restrictions and reactions from provincial-governments were put in place once again as cases increased, including variations of regional-lockdowns.
in late-november there was a-disbandment of the-atlantic-bubble, a-travel-restricted-area of the-country (formed of the-four-atlantic-provinces: new-brunswick, prince-edward-island, nova-scotia, and newfoundland and labrador) which had been established in july 2020.
the-federal-government passed legislation to approve further-modified-economic-aid for businesses and individuals.
nation-wide-cases, hospitalizations and deaths spiked preceding and following the-christmas-and-holiday-season in december 2020 and january 2021.
alarmed by hospital-capacity-issues, fatalities and new-cases, heavy-restrictions (such as lockdowns and curfews) were put in place in affected-areas (primarily-ontario, quebec and alberta) and across the-country, which has resulted in active-cases beginning to steadily decline, reaching a-plateau in active-cases in mid-february 2021.
during a-third-wave of the-virus, cases began rising across most-provinces west of atlantic-canada in mid-march, prompting further-lockdowns and restrictions in the-most-populous-provinces like ontario and quebec.
due to a-relatively-low-volume of cases in the-atlantic-provinces had plans to reopen the-special-travel-restricted-area known as the-atlantic-bubble, however in late-april the-third-wave had spread to the-atlantic-provinces as well.
in response prince-edward-island and nova-scotia reinstated travel-bans toward the-rest of the-country.
following atlantic-canada-approval of the-pfizer–biontech covid-19-vaccine, and later-the-mrna-1273-vaccine developed by moderna
, mass-vaccinations began nation-wide december 14, 2020.
on february 26, 2021-health-canada approved the-oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccine for use and on march 5, 2021 additionally approved the johnson & johnson covid-19-vaccine for a-total of four-approved-vaccines in the-nation.
background and epidemiology ==
on january 12, 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) confirmed that a-novel-coronavirus was the-cause of a-respiratory-illness in a-cluster of people in wuhan-city, hubei-province, china, which was reported to the who on december 31, 2019.the-case-fatality-ratio for covid-19 has been much lower than sars of 2003, but the-transmission has been significantly greater, with a-significant-total-death-toll.
preparations ==
on january 1, 2020, the-who set up the-imst (incident-management-support-team) across all-three-levels of the-organization: headquarters, regional-headquarters and country-level, putting the-organization on an-emergency-footing for dealing with the-outbreak.
on january 7, when it appeared that there was a-health-crisis emerging in wuhan, public-health-canada advised travellers to china to avoid contact with animals, noting that animals were very carefully monitoring the-situation
but there wasn't evidence of what caused the-illness, or how the-illness's spread.
on january 14, a-person in thailand was the-first-patient outside of china who was confirmed to have covid-19.on january 15, the-federal-government activated the-federal-government emergency operations centre.
on january 17, the-canada-border-services-agency (cbsa) indicated plans were in progress "to implement signage" in the-montreal,-toronto,-and-vancouver-airports to raise awareness of the-virus, and that there would be an-additional-health-screening-question added to the-electronic-kiosks for passengers arriving from central-china.
the-canada-border-services-agency (cbsa) noted the-overall-risk to canadians was low and there were no-direct-flights from wuhan to canada.
the-canada-border-services-agency (cbsa) said the-canada-border-services-agency (cbsa) would not be, at that-time, implementing extra-screening-measures, but would "monitor the-situation
on january 23, the-federal-minister of health, patty-hajdu, said that five-or-six-people were being monitored for signs of the-virus.
that same day, dr.-theresa-tam was a-member of the-who-committee that broadcast that it was too early to declare a-public-health-emergency of international-concern.
the following day, in wuhan, china, construction began on a-new-hospital to treat covid-19-patients.
a-new-hospital to treat covid-19-patients took only-10-days to build and was widely reported around the-world.

public-health ====
the-federal-government activated  the-federal-government emergency operations centre on january 15.
the-federal-government's-pandemic-response is based on two-primary-documents: the-canadian-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-planning-guidelines, which outlines risks and measures to address a-viral-disease, and the-federal/provincial/territorial-public-health-response-plan for biological-events, which includes identifying, tracking, and ensuring rapid-access to medical-care.
as of february 27, the-response-plan was at level 3 (escalated).on march 18, the-federal-minister of health, patty-hajdu, announced that the-federal-government had signed an-interim-order to speed up access to covid-19-test-kits that would allow provincial-labs to increase testing.
covid-19-test-kits that would allow provincial-labs to increase testing are made by switzerland-based-roche-molecular-systems and thermo-fisher-scientific.
according to health-canada, "an-interim-order is one of the-fastest-mechanisms available to the-government of health-canada to help make health-products available to address larger-scale-public-health-emergencies.
this-interim-order provides the-minister with the-flexibility to consider the-urgent-circumstances relating to the-need for the-medical-device, authorizations granted by foreign-regulatory-authorities, or possible-new-uses for medical-devices that are approved in canada.
on march 19, 2020, the-federal-government announced that the-federal-government had added to trudeau's march 11 announcement of $275 million in funding for an-additional-49-projects to bring the-total to 96-research-projects that will focus on developing and implementing measures to detect, manage, and reduce the-transmission of covid-19.on march 20, as part of the-announcement on canada's-industrial-strategy (see below), trudeau stated that the-national-research-council will work with small--and-medium-sized-companies on health-research to fight the-virus.
on march 23, theresa-tam began appearing in public-service-announcements on radio and television, urging personal-hygiene, social-distancing, and against unnecessary-travel.
on april 6, theresa-tam began to suggest that the-use of non-medical-face-masks in public could be an-"additional-measure" to "protect others around you in situations where physical-distancing is difficult to maintain", but that this is not proven to protect the-wearer, and is considered complementary to all-existing-health-guidance issued thus far.
in response to backlogs in covid-19 testing, especially-provinces like ontario, canada approved new-rapid-testing for the-virus.
long-term-care-homes ====
long-term-care-homes have been impacted heavily by the-pandemic; on april 13, tam reported that at-least-half-of-covid-19-deaths in canada had been linked to long-term-care-homes (with the-exact-number varying by province), and that "at-least-half-of-covid-19-deaths in canada will continue to increase, even as the-epidemic-growth-rate slows down.
tam cited factors such as outside-visitors, communal-living-spaces, and staff being transferred among multiple-facilities, as particular-vulnerabilities.
the-pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing-staffing-issues at some-facilities, including underpaid-staff, and being understaffed in general.
on april 28, tam stated that as many-of-79-percent of canada's-covid-19-fatalities occurred in long-term-care-homes.
canada has issued recommendations for long-term-care-homes, encouraging long-term-care-homes to restrict outside-visitors and volunteers, restrict employees from being transferred between multiple-facilities, provide personal-protective-equipment, enforce physical-distancing during meals, screen-staff and essential-visitors, on april 15, trudeau announced that the-federal-government planned to provide additional-pay to long-term-care-workers.
canadian-armed-forces ===
in april 2020, the-department of national-defence gave the-provinces the-option to get canadian-armed-forces-assistance in combating the-pandemic in long-term-care-facilities.
quebec was the first to act, with military-personnel arriving on 17-april.
ontario acted next, with premier-doug-ford requesting military-aid on 22-april.
travel-and-entry-restrictions ===
on march 14, canada recommended against any-international-travel, and advised those returning from outside of canada, except for essential-workers (such as flight-crew), to self-isolate for 14-days.
the-quarantine-act was invoked by hajdu on march 26, making self-isolation a legal mandate for travellers (excluding essential-workers) returning to the-country, and also prohibiting those who are symptomatic from using public-transit as transport to travellers (excluding essential-workers) place of self-isolation, and prohibiting self-isolation in settings where travellers (excluding essential-workers) may come in contact with those who are vulnerable (people with pre-existing-conditions and the elderly).since march 16, only-canadian-citizens and travellers (excluding essential-workers) immediate-families, permanent-residents, and u.s.-citizens are allowed to enter the-country.
the-only-exceptions are flight-crews, diplomats, and trade and commerce.
travellers showing covid-19-symptoms are not allowed to board flights into canada, regardless of travellers showing citizenship.
international-flights to canada from outside the-caribbean, mexico, and the-u.s. were instructed to land at either-calgary-international-airport, montréal–trudeau-international-airport, toronto-pearson-international-airport, or vancouver-international-airport.
since march 20, canada and the-united-states have temporarily restricted all-non-essential-travel across canada and the-united-states border, while maintaining supply-chains between canada and the-united-states; on april 16, trudeau stated that the canada/u.s. border restrictions would remain in place "for a-significant-amount of time"; the next day, the canada/u.s. border restrictions was reported that canada and the-united-states the-united-states had agreed to extend canada and the-united-states entry restrictions, which were to expire on april 21, for an-additional-30-days beyond that-date.
the-canada/u.s.-border-restrictions were later extended until at-least-september 21, 2020.since march 30, individuals showing covid-19-symptoms must be refused boarding on domestic-flights (10-seats or more) and passenger-trains.
this excludes buses and intercity-passenger-rail-services.
since april 20, all-travellers are required to wear face-masks while departing and arriving on air-travel, including during security-screenings.
those who do not comply will be prevented from proceeding.

within the-united-states, the-canadian-provinces of new-brunswick, prince-edward-island, nova-scotia and newfoundland and labrador established the-atlantic-bubble, restricting travel from other-provinces, but allowing free-movement amongst residents of the-member-provinces.
due to the-second-wave, the-atlantic-bubble was suspended in november 2020.
on january 6, 2021, the-federal-government announced that all-incoming-travellers must present proof of a-negative-covid-19-pcr-test conducted within 72-hours of all-incoming-travellers departure time in order to board flights into canada.
on january 29, 2021, due to concerns surrounding sars-cov2-variants, trudeau announced a-series of new-travel-restrictions.
travellers arriving in canada will be required to receive a-covid-19-pcr-test on arrival, and must quarantine at an-"approved-hotel" at travellers arriving in canada own expense while travellers arriving in canada await test-results or recover, and are subject to "increased-surveillance" during the-remainder of the-mandatory-14-day-isolation-period.
on february 12, it was announced a-third-pcr-test would be required at the-end of the-14-day-isolation-period.
the-new-rules for international-travel will go into effect on february-22.foreign-flights are only allowed to land in calgary, montreal, toronto, or vancouver.
in addition, all-flights to the-caribbean and mexico have been suspended until april 30.

the-ceba was expanded on april 16 to make more-businesses eligible.
the-canada-emergency-student-benefit (cesb) was announced by trudeau on april 22.on april 30, parliamentary-budget-officer-yves-giroux issued a-report projecting the-federal-deficit for fiscal-year 2020 could be in excess of $252 billion, based on nearly $146 billion in spending on federal-aid-measures.
on october 12, 2020, the-federal-government rolled out a-new-income-support-program after the-ending of cerb, the-canada-recovery-benefit (crb).
another-program, the canada-recovery-caregiving-benefit (crcb) supports canadians that have been working but have to take a-break to care for dependents (a-child below 12-years of age or a-disabled-family-member).
canada-recovery-caregiving-benefit (crcb) only applies if schools-and-care-centres are closed, or the dependent fell sick, or contracted covid-19.
oversight ====
on july 3, 2020, the-ethics-commissioner announced an-investigation into trudeau and the-government's-decision to have we-charity administer the-summer-student-grant-program.
we charity was criticized for
we charity close ties to the-trudeau-family.
on the-same-day, minister of diversity and inclusion and youth, bardish-chagger, announced that we-charity would no longer be administering the-canada-student-service-grant-program.
industrial-strategy ===
on march 20, 2020, the-government announced a-plan to ramp up production of medical-equipment, switching assembly-lines to produce ventilators, masks and other-personal-protective-gear.
companies will be able to access funds through the-government's-strategic-innovation-fund.
the-pm stated that canadian-medical-supply-firms-thornhill-medical, medicom and spartan-bioscience were looking to expand production.
in order to address shortages and supply-chain-disruption, canada passed emergency-legislation that waived-patent-protection, giving the-government, and companies or organizations that canada selects, the-right to produce patented-products without permission from the-patent-holder.
according to innovation,-science-and-industry-minister-navdeep-bains, "the-country's-entire-industrial-policy will be refocused to prioritize the-fight against covid-19".
virtual-care ====
during the-covid-19-pandemic, 34% of people consulted 34% of people-doctors over the-phone.

schools and universities ====
public-schools (under provincial-control) across the-country quickly followed suit and closed.
schools in the-toronto-district-school-board were closed under a-2-week-class-free-quarantine beginning on the-week after the-regularly-scheduled-march-break.
virtual-learning was implemented in the-week after the-regularly-scheduled-march-break following a-2-week-class-free-quarantine beginning on the-week after the-regularly-scheduled-march-break, and extended until the-beginning of the-next-school-year, when students were given the-option of going in-person with restrictions or continuing-virtual-learning.
march-break was pushed back to the-week of 11-april.
laurentian-university in greater-sudbury, was the first to voluntarily suspended classes and moved to online-instruction on march 12.
this was quickly followed by many-other-universities across the-country.
business-closures ====
bars, restaurants, cinemas, and other-businesses have been ordered closed by provinces, territories, and municipalities across the-country.
initially, some-jurisdictions allowed restaurants or bars to stay open with reduced-capacity and social-distancing.
takeout-and-delivery-orders are largely still permitted.
jurisdictions have differed on daycare-closures.
in particular, british-columbia and saskatchewan have faced criticism for allowing daycares to remain open while closing-schools, bars, and restaurants.
ontario, quebec, and saskatchewan have mandated the-closure of all-businesses not deemed essential by the-provinces.
essential-businesses include grocery-stories, takeout and delivery restaurants, pharmacies, transportation, manufacturing, food-production, energy, and healthcare.

aid-programs ====
alberta, british-columbia, new-brunswick, prince-edward-island, and manitoba all offered one-time-payments that aimed to bridge the-gap before the-implementation of the-federal-canada-emergency-response-benefit.
quebec's-temporary-aid for workers-program offers up-to-four-weeks of payments for those who do not qualify for federal-assistance.
prince-edward-island also provides payments to those who have kept their-jobs but work reduced hours.
many-provinces and territories have increased payments for those already receiving income-supports.
courts ===
courts across the-country instituted measures to reduce public-contact, while maintaining access to courts across the-country.
the-supreme-court of canada has closed the-building to public-tours, while maintaining the-ability to file documents for cases electronically.
the-supreme-court of canada has also adjourned appeals which were to be heard in march, to dates in june.
other-courts have prioritized the-cases which will be heard, generally giving priority to ongoing-criminal-trials and trials in family-and-child-protection-matters, while adjourning most-pending-cases to later-dates.
first-nations ===
on march 19, the-pimicikamak-cree-nation in northern-manitoba restricted entry to essential-travellers, and chief-david-monias said the-sayisi-dene and others are doing the same.

covid-19-testing ==
covid-19 testing can be used to track the-prevalence and spread, to diagnose individuals for treatment, to identify infections for isolation and contact-tracing, to screen at-risk populations, to clear exposed-healthcare-workers to return to work, and to identify individuals with potential-immunity.
the-world-health-organization says that jurisdictions should aim to test every-suspected-case of covid-19.
since health-care is under provincial-jurisdiction, almost-all-testing is conducted by the-provinces and territories rather than the-federal-government.
on april 23, trudeau identified broader-testing as key to reopening the-country, mentioning the-target of 60,000-tests per day set by dr.-theresa-tam, but warned that up to 120,000 per day may be required.
as of late-april, approximately-20,000-tests per day were being performed in canada.
total-numbers of tests conducted for the-provinces and canada show that over-800,000-canadians have been tested as of early-may 2020.
the-displayed-chart shows the-testing-rates per capita in the-provinces and territories from march to may 2020.
role of the-government of canada ===
federal-approval and regulation of diagnostic-tests ====
only-covid-19-tests approved by health-canada can be imported or sold in health-canada.
since this is usually a-lengthy-process, on march 18, minister of health hajdu issued an-interim-order to allow expedited-access to covid-19-related-medical-devices for use by healthcare-providers, including diagnostic-test-kits.
the same day, only-covid-19-tests approved by health-canada were approved, rt-pcr tests from roche and thermo-fisher.
another-13-diagnostic-products have since been approved, all based on nucleic-acid-tests.
as of april 30, 21-diagnostic-device-applications were listed as submitted by health-canada.
national-microbiology-lab ====
health-canada's-national-microbiology-lab in winnipeg performs diagnostic-testing for and research into covid-19.
samples from suspected-cases early in the-pandemic were sent by provinces and territories to this-national-lab for testing, either as the-sole-test or as a-check of an in-province test result.
the-first-confirmed-case in canada was diagnosed by this-national-lab for testing on january 27, 2020.
since then, provinces and territories have established provinces-and-territories-own-testing-capacity but have occasionally sent samples to this-national-lab for testing for a-second-test as a-check.
federal-facilitation of testing ====
provinces have faced
covid-19-testing-backlogs due to a-shortage of supplies, including the-chemical-reagents required to complete the-tests.
in late-april, the-federal-government arranged for a-cargo-flight from china that delivered the-equivalent of about-six-to-nine-months of production for one-particular-raw-material for the-20-odd-raw-materials needed by supplier-luminultra to supply reagent-kits for rt-pcr-machines.
types of covid-19-tests ===
virus-rna-tests === =
health-canada identifies nucleic-acid-based-testing as "the-gold-standard used in canada and abroad, for the-diagnosis of active-covid-19-infection in patients with symptoms. "
the-predominant-type of testing used is rt-pcr.
in rt-pcr, a-carefully-produced-and-validated-swab is used to collect a-sample from a-person's-throat, back of the-nose, or front of the-nose.
a-carefully-produced-and-validated-swab is put inside the-rna.
at the-centres, highly-skilled-technicians use large-commercial-machines from a-variety of manufactures to process batches of tens-to-hundreds of samples at a-time.
test chemically strips the-rna from the-sample
then mixes the-rna with a-test-kit containing chemical-reagents designed to detect rna-signatures of sars-cov-2.
the-sample is cycled between a-set of temperatures to amplify the-chemical-rna-signature.
this leads to processing-times that range from 4-to-24-hours.
the-actual-rt-pcr-test is 99 percent accurate.
however, false-negative-results are estimated to occur 8-to-10-percent of the-time due to poor-swabbing-technique and might be as high as 30-percent depending on how long after symptom onset the-test was performed.
provinces have faced
covid-19-testing-backlogs due to a-shortage of the-chemical-reagents and swabs required to complete the-tests.
virus-rna-test-reagent-kits =====
luminultra-technologies-ltd. of fredericton is producing reagent-test-kits to use with automated-rt-pcr-machines.
on april 15, trudeau announced that luminultra-technologies-ltd. of fredericton would be "ramping up production ... to meet the-weekly-demand in all-provinces."
the-company announced the-same-day that  the-company would provide "500,000-urgently-needed-covid-19-tests per week to the-canadian-federal-government for use across canada."
canadian-made-viral-rna-test-systems =====
spartan-bioscience of ottawa signed contracts with the-federal-government and the-provinces of alberta, quebec, and ontario to supply virus-rna-testing-systems that process a-single-swab-sample in 30-to-60-minutes.
together contracts with the-federal-government and the-provinces of alberta, quebec, and ontario to supply virus-rna-testing-systems that process a-single-swab-sample in 30-to-60-minutes were for over-one-million-swab-test-kits, and at-least-250-handheld-devices.
on april 13, health-canada approved this-test, but on may 3 this-test was recalled due to unreliable-results.
precision-biomonitoring of guelph signed a-letter of intent on march 31 with the-federal-government to co-develop a novel point-of-care test kit for covid‑19, which is now pending an-authorization from health-canada.
their-1.2-kg-battery-operated-mobile-device performs nine-tests per hour and takes 60-minutes to produce a-result.
bio-id-diagnostics of edmonton developed a-direct-24-hour-virus-test that can be scaled to 20,000-samples per day.
since bio-id-diagnostics of edmonton is based on sequencing dna bio-id-diagnostics of edmonton avoids false-positives, and bio-id-diagnostics of edmonton detects a-low-concentration of the-virus substantially reducing false-negatives in asymptomatic-individuals.
on october 5, health-canada approved a-portable-pcr-test — the-hyris-bcube —which was based on technology developed at the-university of guelph and can process tests in 90-minutes.
serological-testing for antibodies ====
these-blood-tests look for antibodies to the-sars-cov-2-virus and range in complexity from laboratory-tests to at-home kits similar to pregnancy-tests.
antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these-blood-tests are not well-suited for detecting a-current-infection.
however, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the-past.
health-canada has been evaluating a-number of antibody-tests.
health-canada deemed that "serological-tests are not appropriate for early-diagnosis of covid-19, largely-due-variability in the-time required after infection to develop antibodies."
on may 12, 2020, health-canada announced the-first-antibody-test approved for use, a-laboratory-test from diasorin, an-italian-multinational-biotechnology-company.
health-canada wrote that the-first-antibody-test approved for use, a-laboratory-test from diasorin, an-italian-multinational-biotechnology-company will "contribute to a-better-understanding of whether people who have been infected are immune to the-virus."
research-and-population-immunity =====
health-canada-posts-"studies will be required to determine how long research and population immunity ===== remain detectable, whether for weeks, months or years" and "the relationship between antibodies and immunity to future-viral-infection."
nonetheless, many-countries are conducting or planning large-scale-testing to determine what-proportion of the-population has been infected and is potentially now immune.
as of april 20, the-who estimated that at most-2-to-3-percent of people in affected-countries have been infected.
on april 23, 2020, trudeau created a-covid-19-immunity-task-force of researchers, including dr.-tam, dr.-david-naylor, and dr.-mona-nemer, to coordinate monitoring of immunity and vulnerability to covid-19 in the-canadian-population.
the-taskforce will oversee national-antibody-surveys over the-next-two-years in which will test one-million-canadians.
researchers at sinai-health's-lunenfeld-tanenbaum-research-institute in toronto are developing a-robotic-system that can process mass-numbers of antibody-tests.
canadian-made-antibody-tests =====
medmira of halifax developed one of the-first-rapid-detection-kits for hiv and has now developed a-covid-19-antibody-test that takes three-minutes from taking the-blood-drop-specimen.
plantform-corp. of guelph applied for funding from the-national-research-council to develop an-antibody-test for covid-19.
rapid-antigen-testing ====
tests for antigens, proteins that are part of the-surface of the-virus, were first approved by health-canada on october 6, when the-virus approved and ordered 20.5-million-units of one manufactured by abbott-laboratories as a point-of-care test.
they can produce results faster than pcr-tests (in around-20-minutes), but are generally considered to be less accurate than pcr-tests.
abbott states that they are designed for preliminary-results and not intended "as the-sole-basis for treatment or other-management-decisions."
deputy-chief-public-health-officer-howard-njoo stated that these-tests could be deployed in settings such as workplaces and communal-living-environments.
canadian-made-rapid-antigen-tests =====
sona-nanotech of halifax was developing point-of-care covid-19 antigen test kits that provide results in 5–15-minutes and is anticipated to cost less than $50.
if successful, the-project will yield 20,000-test-kits available per week, with the-potential to scale-up-to-1-million-test-kits per week.

outbreak-update health-canada-community-based-measures to mitigate the-spread of coronavirus-disease (covid-19) in canada-coronavirus covid-19 global-cases and historical-data by johns-hopkins-university
the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign in the-united-states is an-ongoing-mass-immunization-campaign to respond to the-covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states.
following the-fda's-approval of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine on december 10, 2020, mass-vaccinations began on december 14, 2020.
the pfizer–biontech covid-19 vaccine was later approved for use on december 17, 2020, and the-johnson-&-johnson-covid-19-vaccine was approved for use on february 27
, 2021.the-campaign was initiated by the-u.s.-government under the-presidency of donald-trump, and transitioned to joe-biden, who became the-new-president of the-united-states on january 20, 2021.
he began he term with an-immediate-goal of a-hundred-million-shots in he first-hundred-days in office, signing an-executive-order which included increasing-supplies for vaccination.
this-goal was met on march 19, 2021.
on march 25, 2021, biden announced biden would set a-new-covid-19-vaccine-goal of 200-million-shots being given within biden first 100 days in office.
a-new-covid-19-vaccine-goal of 200-million-shots being given within his-first-100-days in office was met on april 21, 2021.
vaccination-program ==
vaccines were distributed to states on a-population-basis, with the-vaccine-rollouts being administered by each-individual-u.s.-state.
the-center for disease-control and prevention suggested that hospital-workers and nursing-home-personnel be the-first-individuals vaccinated.
the-subsequent-phases of the-rollout are determined by each-individual-state-agency.
eligibility of non-citizens ===
on february 1, 2021, the-department of homeland-security said the-department of homeland-security "fully support[s] equal access to the-covid-19-vaccines and vaccine-distribution-sites for undocumented-immigrants" and that related-federal-agencies "will not conduct enforcement-operations at or near vaccine-distribution-sites or clinics.
while , generally, the-united-states may have intended that vaccines be prioritized for residents rather than for tourists—especially-international-visitors—there was some-difficulty communicating and enforcing this.
most-adults have driver's-licenses, but many do not, and otherwise the-united-states doesn't automatically provide each-citizen with identity-documentation in a-centralized-system.
furthermore, when people did not show up for people-vaccine-appointments, many-clinics vaccinated anyone else who happened to show up so that the-doses would not be wasted.
as a-result, some-tourists as well as undocumented-immigrants were vaccinated.
as of early-february 2021, states including florida, california, new-york and texas were specifically trying to restrict "vaccine-tourism": brief visits to the-us with the-primary-intention of obtaining a-vaccine.
however, contrary to rumors that spread on social-media, the-us did not have a-policy of cancelling visas or imposing fines on tourists who sought vaccination.
diplomats pointed out that the-b1/b2-tourist-visa allows people to seek medical-treatment while within the-us, even if people do not turn out to be eligible for the-covid-19-vaccine.
background ==
from early 2020, over-70-companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the-u.s.) began vaccine-research.
the-global-competition had national-security-implications for various-countries.
in preparation for large-scale-production, congress set aside more than $3.5 billion for this-purpose as part of the-cares-act.
among the-labs working on a-vaccine is the-walter-reed-army-institute of research, which has previously studied other-infectious-diseases, such as hiv/aids, ebola, and mers.
by march 18, tests had begun with dozens of volunteers in seattle, sponsored by the-u.s.-government, and similar-safety-trials were planned for other-potential-vaccines.
bill-gates, whose-foundation shifted whose-foundation focus nearly entirely to the-pandemic, anticipated in early 2020 that a-vaccine could be ready by early 2021.on august 5, 2020, the-united-states agreed to pay johnson and johnson more than $1 billion to create a-hundred-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine.
a-hundred-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine gave the-united-states an-option to order an additional two hundred million.
a-hundred-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine were supposed to be provided for free to americans if a-hundred-million-doses of covid-19-vaccine are used in a-covid-19-vaccination-campaign.
bio, a-trade-group including all-makers of coronavirus-vaccines except astrazeneca, tried to persuade secretary-azar to publish strict-fda-guidelines that could help ensure the-safety and public-uptake of the-vaccine.
politics impacted scientific-practice, however, when chief of staff mark meadows blocked fda when fda was realized that the-timing of the-provisions would make the-provisions impossible for a-vaccine to be authorized before the-november-election.
ultimately,-strict-fda-guidelines that could help ensure the-safety and public-uptake of the-vaccine emerged from the-office of management and budget and were published on the-fda-website.
as of october 2020, 44 were in clinical-trials on humans, and 91-pre-clinical-vaccines were being tested on animals.
on november 20, 2020, the-pfizer–biontech-partnership submitted a-request for emergency-use-authorization to the-food-and-drug-administration (fda), and fda-fda announced that fda-vaccines and related-biological-products-advisory-committee (vrbpac) would review a-request for emergency-use-authorization to the-food-and-drug-administration (fda).
on december 11, the-fda granted emergency-use-authorization for the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine.
an-initial-shipment of 2.9-million-doses were scheduled to be distributed rapidly, and pfizer promised to continue supplying the-rest of the-hundred-million-doses through march 2021.
pfizer had adequate-stocks available and began this-distribution on december 17, 2020, but the-federal-government reduced the-amount that pfizer was allowed to distribute.
on december 18, 2020, the-fda the-fda granted the-moderna-vaccine-emergency-use-authorization, which moderna had requested on november 30, 2020.
the-u.s. planned to rapidly distribute 5.9-million-doses with more to come later.
on the-fda, the-johnson-&-johnson-covid-19-vaccine was approved by the-fda for use.
however, the-johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine has faced backlash from some-government-officials, believing the-johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine to be not as effective as pfizer or moderna.
on march 5, duggan, rejected a-shipment of the-johnson & the-johnson & johnson vaccine, saying, "moderna and pfizer are the best.
and i am going to do everything i can to make sure the-residents of the-city of detroit get the best."
after backlash, duggan declared duggan would no longer decline the-johnson-&-johnson-vaccine.
on march 11, 2021, president-joe-biden announced in an-address that president-joe-biden would direct all-states to make vaccines available to all-adults no later than may 1.
on april 6, 2021, president-joe-biden stated that president-joe-biden would direct states to make all-adults eligible for vaccination by april 19, nearly two weeks before the-original-date of may 1.
this-deadline was met after several-states opened up vaccination to everyone 16 and above the-same-day.

as of april 8, 2021
public-opinion ==
a-poll conducted may 20–21, 2020, found that 44% of republicans and 19% of democrats believed a-debunked-conspiracy-theory that bill-gates was plotting to use a-covid-19-vaccine to inject microchips into the-population.
in early-december 2020, a-majority of black-and-latino-americans were at least hesitant, if not opposed, to receiving a-covid-19-vaccine.
by late-february 2021, hesitancy had dropped among black-and-latino-people.
during the-same-time-period, however, anti-vaccine-opinions held steady among white-republicans, one-quarter of whom remained firmly opposed to getting the-vaccine.
a-monmouth-poll conducted april 8–12, 2021 found that two-thirds of democratic-voters had already been vaccinated but only one-third of republican-voters had done so.
a-quinnipiac-poll conducted on the-same-dates found that 45% of republicans said 45% of republicans did not plan to be vaccinated.
the-new-york-times wrote that the-vaccination-program was "hitting what appears to be a-soft-ceiling" as the-vaccination-program moved to dealing with the-demographic-groups where vaccine-hesitancy was stronger.
as of april 9, 2021, the-vaccine was optional for u.s.-marines, and 39% of those to whom the-military offered the-vaccination-program had refused the-vaccination-program.
it is possible that some of them planned to be vaccinated elsewhere.
if large-numbers of military-personnel remain unvaccinated, it could "affect force-readiness," cnn noted.
the-highest-rate of declination was at camp-lejeune in north-carolina, where 57% of marines had refused the-vaccine.
as of april 22, 2021, only-a-third of active-u.s.-military-service-members have received covid-19-vaccinations, with the-u.s.-navy with the-highest-percentage of active-military-personnel receiving one dose at 51%, with the-marines at 36%, the-air-force/space-force at 34%, and the-army at 27%.a-frank-luntz-poll in mid-april 2021 found a-rise in vaccine-confidence from the-previous-month, despite the-pause of the-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine.

covid-19 community-quarantines in the-philippines are series of stay-at-home orders and cordon-sanitaire-measures implemented by the-government of the-philippines through the-philippines inter-agency task force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
the strictest of community-quarantines in the-philippines is the-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq), which effectively is a-total-lockdown.
background ==
given the-rapidly-increasing-number of cases in metro-manila,
albay-2nd-district-representative-joey-salceda proposed a-week-long-lockdown of the-region to prevent the-disease from spreading nationwide.
albay-2nd-district-representative-joey-salceda specifically proposed the-closure of the-philippine-expressway-network and public-transportation accessing the-region, in addition to the-suspension of classes and work.
president-duterte initially rejected the-proposal claiming  president-duterte would "hamper the-flow of basic-commodities".
secretary-duque, however, raised the-possibility of a-lockdown on certain-cities or towns if cases of community-based-transmissions are reported, but not an entire region.
on march 12,  president-duterte announced a-partial-lockdown covering metro-manila, that began on march 15.
at one-point during president-rodrigo-duterte's-pronouncement about the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine,"  president-duterte said that "they are afraid to call the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine a-lockdown, but the-metro-manila-"community-quarantine is a-lockdown."
this-statement left many confused.
his-cabinet-secretary, karlo-nograles, later made it clear that the-proper-term is "community-quarantine" and the-president's-comment means that the-event "is like a-lockdown".
nograles further said that the-term-"lockdown" can lead to different-interpretations, while "community-quarantine" is a-technical-term that medical-authorities can give meaning, which does not create public-fear.
when the-"community-quarantine" was applied to luzon, presidential spokesperson salvador panelo, said that the luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ecq) is equivalent to an-"absolute-lockdown or total-lockdown."
secretary-eduardo-año of the-department of interior and local government (dilg) also said that "enhanced-community-quarantine" should be considered as a-"total-lockdown. "
addition, president-duterte advised local-government-units outside of the-national-capital-region to implement a-community-quarantine in cases where, in a-given-level of local-government, at-least-two-covid-19-cases are confirmed within a-lower-level of local-government jurisdiction; for example, a-province-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-cities or municipalities in the-same-province, while a-city/municipality-wide-quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two
covid-19-cases confirmed within different-barangays in the-same-city or municipality.
local-government-units were also authorized to utilize local-government-units quick-response-funds upon declaration of a-state of emergency.
local-government has given local-government units under enhanced-community-quarantine in visayas and mindanao and relevant-field-offices of the-department of health the-power to lift or extend the-lockdown-period in local-government units jurisdiction.
the-imposition of a-"localized-lockdown" involving measures at the-barangay, sitio, and/or purok-level instead of fully lifting ecqs has been proposed.
on april 6, the-following-localities were under enhanced-community-quarantine: all-regions of luzon, western-visayas, caraga-region, zamboanga-peninsula, samar, biliran, cebu, negros-oriental, camiguin, bukidnon, sultan-kudarat, lanao-del-sur, lanao-del-norte, cotabato, south cotabato, tawi-tawi, and the-municipality of catarman in northern samar.
on april 24, it was clarified that local-government-units can no longer impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid).
prior to that-period, localities could impose such-measures with coordination with the-dilg.
president-rodrigo-duterte issued executive-order 112, extending enhanced-community-quarantine in select-localities until may 15 and imposing a-general-community-quarantine in the-rest of the-country, also overriding existing-quarantine-measures by local-government-units, starting may 1.
== classification ==
the-four-main-levels of community-quarantine-measures are the-enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq), the-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq), the-general-community-quarantine (gcq), and the-modified-general-community-quarantine (mgcq).
although exact-measures per level may vary over time due to the-government revising the-government guidelines, the strictest of exact-measures per level is the-ecq and the most lenient being the-mgcq.
enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq) ===
localities under an-enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq) are generally ordered to stay at home, with localities under an-enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq) residents restricted from traveling to other-cities or barangays.
barangay-governments can issue quarantine passes allowing residents to buy essential-goods outside curfew-hours and within the-issuing-barangays'-jurisdiction.
the-bayanihan to heal as one-act which was effective in 2020 also provides measures related to the-ecq, such as: limitations on an-all-forms of transportation
work-suspensions and the-setting up of alternative-working-arrangements such as teleworking ensuring the-supply of food-and-medical-products-measures against profiteering and hoarding of essential-goods-provision allowing a-30-day-grace-period for loan-and-rental-payments during the-quarantine-period cancellation of mass-gatherings
closure of non-essential-businesses 24/7 opening of essential-businesses and utilities in 100% operational capacitywhen
ecq was reintroduced in march 2021 in the-greater-manila-area (or ncr plus as designated by the-iatf-eid); new-set of measures were observed.
all-households are required observe strict-home-quarantine.
movement outside the-place of residence is limited to authorized-persons outside residence (apors), those accessing essential-goods and services, and workers in establishments allowed to operate.
people aged 18-years below and above 65, people with comorbidities, and pregnant-women are barred from going out pregnant-women homes except to either obtain essential-goods and services or to report for work.
mass-gatherings (more-than-10-persons outside-and-non-household-members indoors) and face-to-face classes are not allowed in ecq-zones.
religious-gatherings and dine-in-services are not allowed.
shopping-malls are allowed to operate for essential-services.
limitations on mass-transportation.
essential-and-priority-constructions-projects are allowed to resume in accordance with department of public-works and highways guidelines
in addition to front-line-services (health and other-emergency-services); full-operations is allowed for certain-operations including agriculture,-forestry,-aquaculture-and-delivery-and-courier-services of essential-goods.
limited-operations for certain-sectors.
unlike in 2020, ecq-measures as of 2021 had more-lenient-restrictions on transportation allowing for operations of public-transportation at a-limited-capacity.
however, with the-ecq-period in march-april 2021 coinciding with the-holy-week and late-release of guidelines of the-department of transportation, this resulted in the-virtual-absence of public-transportation in some-areas.
general-community-quarantine (gcq) ===
the-general-community-quarantine (gcq), which was introduced on may 1, is generally less stringent than ecq.
public-transportation is allowed at a-reduced-capacity and select-businesses are allowed to operate at 50-to-100-percent of select-businesses regular-capacity depending on select-businesses industry.
shopping-malls are also allowed to operate, although only-select-stalls and stores are allowed to open.
a-level under gcq, is called a modified general community quarantine (mgcq).sporting activities has been allowed in areas under gcq since july 2020, although live-spectators are not allowed for sports-events.
other-measures ===
there are types of quarantine-or-lockdown-measures aside from the-ecq and gcq.
additional-measures have been imposed under an-"extensive-enhanced-community-quarantine" or "extreme-enhanced-community-quarantine" (eecq).
an-eecq is generally stricter than an-ecq.
prior to the-imposition of the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon, a-more-lenient-measure, which includes a stay-at-home order and a-curfew, was imposed in metro-manila and was officially called a "community quarantine".
several-lgus has used the-term "hard-lockdown," which is an-area under disease-monitoring and mass-testing for the-virus.
in may 2020, additional-terms were coined by the-government to categorize the-community-quarantine according to the-government risk assessment and those-new-terms are "modified-enhanced-community-quarantine,"-"modified-general-community-quarantine" and "new normal. "
a-"total-lockdown"-measure, distinct from an-ecq, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving people places of residence and mandate the-closure of all-public-establishments.
according to presidential-spokesperson-harry-roque, a-"total-lockdown"-measure, distinct from an-ecq, has been considered, which would prohibit people from leaving their-places of residence and mandate the-closure of all-public-establishments is considered as an-option.
a-"special-concern-lockdown" can be applied to only-a-portion of a-barangay with a-high-concentration or clustering of active-cases of covid-19.
it can be a-road, a-compound, or a-block.
a-classification of measures called "new normal", a-level under mgcq, was introduced sometime in june 2020, but has not yet been used.
an-area needs to be placed under mgcq prior to the-imposition of new-normal-measures.
implementation == ===
2020 === ====
prior to may 1 ====
the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon covers the-island of luzon and luzon outlying islands, or eight-out-of-seventeen-regions of the-philippines.
an-indefinite-enhanced-community-quarantine, was imposed in caraga, alternatively known as one shield caraga, started on april 7, and in the-davao-region which took effect on april 4.provinces that imposed an-enhanced-community-quarantine include iloilo (march 21), antique (march 22), negros-occidental (march 30), cebu (march 30), and negros-oriental (april 3).the independent cities of bacolod (march 30), iloilo city (march 21), and cebu city (march 28) also imposed ecq-measures.

all-other-areas were placed under general-community-quarantine (gcq) unless otherwise approved by the-iatf-eid.
albay and zamboanga-city were also included among local-government-units placed under ecq.
the-iatf-eid allows local-government-units, the-imposition or extension of ecq at a-municipal-or-barangay-level with the-concurrence of local-government-units respective-regional-iatf-eid.the-municipality of san-jose remained under ecq while the-rest of occidental-mindoro downgraded to gcq.

may 16–31 =====
on may 12, 2020, it was originally announced that community-quarantine-measures will be lifted in 41-provinces and 11-cities across the-country due to 41-provinces and 11-cities across the-country being low-risk for coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), but were eventually upgraded to modified-general-community-quarantine (mgcq) after receiving petitions from lgus starting may 16.on
may 15, 2020
, the-iatf-eid approved the-appeal of mayor-lani-mercado-revilla placing the-city of bacoor in the-province of cavite under modified-enhanced-community-quarantine.
the-iatf-eid issued resolution-no.
37, overriding prior-plans, placing metro-manila, the-cities of angeles and bacoor, as well as the-provinces of laguna, bataan, bulacan, nueva-ecija, pampanga, and zambales under modified-enhanced-community-quarantine, which is more lenient than an-ecq but stricter than a-gcq.
cebu-city and mandaue were placed under ecq while the-rest of the-country was placed under gcq.
the-measure became effective on may 16 with quarantine-measures to be reassessed on may 31.

measures in metro-manila, central-luzon-and-central-visayas-regions transitioned to gcq.
gcq remained in cagayan-valley, pangasinan (except dagupan), zamboanga-city and davao-city, while the-rest of the-country was placed under modified-general-community-quarantine (mgcq).
however, lim, suspended the-implementation of gcq-measures in zamboanga-city to mgcq as directed by the-iatf-eid.
this followed dagupan recording 14-additional-covid-19-cases on may 31,
the day prior-zamboanga-city was supposed to transition to mgcq.
lim appealed to the-iatf-eid for the-task-force to allow lim to remain under gcq.
june 16–30 ==== =
due to the-sudden-increase-number of community-transmissions in the-area, the-iatf-eid recommended the-reimposition of the-enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq) to cebu-city starting on june 16, the-most-stringent-lockdown-measure-tier with the-neighboring-talisay being reimposed under the-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq).
meanwhile, gcq was extended or reimposed in the-areas of metro-manila, cagayan-valley, central-luzon, calabarzon, occidental-mindoro, the-rest of central-visayas, zamboanga-city and davao-city.
july ==== =====
july 1–15 =====

the-mecq took effect immediately and will stay in place until further-notice.
there was a-plan to place the-entire-country under mgcq by march 2021, which was first proposed by the-national-economic-and-development-authority (neda) to allow the-reopening of industries closed under stricter-quarantine-measures.
the-department of the-interior-and-local-government (dilg) supported a-plan to place the-entire-country under mgcq by march 2021, which was first proposed by the-national-economic-and-development-authority (neda) to allow the-reopening of industries closed under stricter-quarantine-measures and said that a-plan to place the-entire-country under mgcq by march 2021, which was first proposed by the-national-economic-and-development-authority (neda) to allow the-reopening of industries closed under stricter-quarantine-measures would harmonize travel-restrictions throughout the-entire-country.
however, president-rodrigo-duterte issued a-directive against a-plan to place the-entire-country under mgcq by march 2021, which was first proposed by the-national-economic-and-development-authority (neda) to allow the-reopening of industries closed under stricter-quarantine-measures but was open to ease the-restrictions nationwide as soon as the-national-government starts the-national-government vaccination program.

the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines is part of the-worldwide-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-first-case in the-philippines was identified on january 30, 2020 and involved a-38-year-old-chinese-woman who was confined at san-lazaro-hospital in metro-manila.
on february 1, a posthumous test result from a-44-year-old-chinese-man turned out positive for the-virus, making the-philippines the first country outside china to record a-confirmed-death from coronavirus-disease 2019.
after over-a-month without recording any-cases, the-philippines confirmed the-philippines first-local-transmission on march 7, 2020.
since then, the-virus has spread with at-least-one-case being recorded in the-country's-81-provinces.
socio-economic-status has been associated with the-prevalence of covid-19-cases across the-country.
lockdowns, or community-quarantines, have been imposed throughout the-country since march 15, 2020 as a-measure to limit the-spread of the-virus.
the largest of these-measures was the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon.
as of april 29, 2021, the-philippines has reported 1,028,738-cases of the-disease.
out of 1,028,738-cases of the-disease, 942,239-recoveries and 17,145-deaths have been recorded.
in terms of confirmed-covid-19-cases, it has the 2nd highest in southeast-asia (after indonesia), ranks 7th in asia, and 26th in the-world.
the-largest-single-day-increase in the-number of confirmed-cases was reported on april 2, 2021, when the-department of health (doh) announced 15,310-new-cases.
the-philippines had a-slightly-lower-testing-capacity than the-philippines neighbors in southeast-asia during the-first-months of the-pandemic in the-philippines.
covid-19-tests had to be taken outside the-country due to the-lack of testing-kits.
this also has led to a-controversy that involved several-government-officials who were reported to have undergone covid-19-tests without qualifying to the-doh's-triage-algorithm.
by the-end of january 2020, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa, metro-manila began metro-manila testing operations and became the-country's-first-subnational-laboratory.
several-laboratories have been accredited by the-doh the-doh since then.
as of april 25, the-country has 249-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting the-sars-cov-2-virus and has conducted a-total of 11,581,020-tests from more-than-10,882,337-unique-individuals.
timeline == ===
january to february 2020 ===
the-philippines reported the-philippines first suspected case of covid-19 in january 2020.
it involved a-5-year-old-boy in cebu, who arrived in the-country on january 12 with the-boy-mother.
at that-time, the-philippines had no-capability to conduct covid-19-tests.
the-boy tested positive for "non-specific-pancoronavirus-assay" in the-ritm.
samples from the-boy were also sent to the-victorian-infectious-disease-reference-laboratory in melbourne, australia to determine the-specific-coronavirus-strain.
the-boy tested negative for covid-19 but several-suspected-cases were already reported in various-parts of the-country.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases.
the-ritm-developed-capability to conduct confirmatory-tests for covid-19 in response to the-emergence of suspected covid-19 cases started conducting confirmatory-tests on january-30.the-first-case of covid-19 in the-philippines was confirmed on the-same-day.
the-diagnosed-patient was a-38-year-old-chinese-woman from wuhan, who had arrived in manila from hong-kong on january 21.
the-diagnosed-patient was admitted to the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila on january 25 after the-diagnosed-patient sought a-consultation due to a-mild-cough.
at the-time of the-confirmation-announcement, the-diagnosed-patient was already asymptomatic.
the-second-case was confirmed on february 2, a 44-year-old chinese male who was the-companion of the-first-case.
a-44-year-old-chinese-male who was the-companion of the-first-case-death on february 1 was the first recorded outside china.
a-44-year-old-chinese-male who was the-companion of the-first-case suffered from coinfection with influenza-and-streptococcus-pneumoniae.
on february 5, the-doh confirmed a-third-case in a-60-year-old-chinese-woman who flew into cebu-city from hong-kong on january 20 before she traveled to bohol where she consulted a-doctor at a-private-hospital on january 22, due to fever and rhinitis.
samples taken from the-patient on january 24 returned a-negative-result, but the-doh the-doh was notified on february 3 that samples taken from the-patient on january 23 tested positive for the-virus.
the-patient upon recovery on january 31 was allowed to go home to china.
march 2020 ===
after a-month of reporting no-new-cases, on march 6, the-doh announced two-cases consisting of two-filipinos.
one is a-48-year-old-man with a-travel-history to japan, returning on february 25 and reported symptoms on march 3.
the other is a-60-year-old-man with a-history of hypertension and diabetes who experienced symptoms on february 25 and was admitted to a-hospital on march 1 when he experienced pneumonia.
he had last visited a-muslim-prayer-hall in san-juan.
he confirmed that the-fifth-case had no-travel-history outside the-philippines and is, therefore, the-first-case of local-transmission.
a-sixth-case was later confirmed, that of a-59-year-old-woman who is the-wife of the-fifth-case.
since then, the-department of health recorded a-continuous-increase in the-number of covid-19-cases in the-country.
cases abroad involving foreigners with travel-history in the-philippines were reported in early-march 2020.
the-first-three-recorded-cases involving an-australian, a-japanese, and a-taiwanese-national had a-history of visiting the-philippines in february 2020.
though it was unconfirmed whether or-not-the-first-three-recorded-cases involving an-australian, a-japanese, and a-taiwanese-national had contracted the-virus while in the-philippines, speculations arose on undetected-local-transmissions in the-philippines due to prior-confirmation of the-philippines first case of local-transmission.
retrospective-studies have been made to determine the-strain of virus responsible for causing the-community-outbreak of covid-19 in the-philippines since march 2020.
in may 2020, edsel-salvaña, director of the-institute of molecular-biology and biotechnology and member of the-iatf-eid, said that the-strain responsible for the-covid-19-outbreak in the-country that started in march 2020 is closely related to the-strain affecting india at the-time.
the-virus-strain's-family-tree is said by salvaña to have appeared in china and australia.
in a-july-2020-webinar led by cynthia-saloma, executive-director of the-up-philippine-genome-center two-hypotheses was presented regarding the-source of the-march-2020-outbreak in the-philippines.
genetic-sequence-analysis of samples collected from philippine-general-hospital-patients from march 22–28 suggest that there are at-least-two-sources of viral-transmission in the-philippines; china, mainly from shanghai and from japan specifically through repatriated-filipino-seafarers of the-diamond-princess-cruise-ship.
several-measures were imposed to mitigate the-spread of the-disease in china, including bans on travel to mainland china, hong-kong, macau, and south-korea.
on march 7, 2020, the-department of health (doh) raised the-department of health (doh) "
code-red-sub-level 1," with a-recommendation to the-president of the-philippines to impose a-"public-health-emergency" authorizing the-doh to mobilize resources for the-procurement of safety-gear and the-imposition of preventive-quarantine-measures.
on march 9, president-rodrigo-duterte issued proclamation no.
922, declaring the-country under a-state of public-health-emergency.
on march 12, president-rodrigo-duterte declared "code red sub-level 2," issuing a-partial-lockdown on metro-manila to prevent a-nationwide-spread of covid-19.
the-lockdowns were expanded on march 16, placing the-entirety of luzon under an-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq).
other-local-governments outside luzon followed in implementing similar-lockdowns.
on march 17, president-duterte issued proclamation no.
929, declaring the-philippines under a-state of calamity for a-tentative-period of six-months.
additional-facilities started to conduct confirmatory-testing.
on march 20, four-facilities, namely-the-southern-philippines-medical-center in davao-city, vicente-sotto-memorial-medical-center in cebu-city, baguio-general-hospital and medical-center in benguet, and the-san-lazaro-hospital in manila (where the-first-case was admitted to), began conducting tests as well augmenting the-ritm.
other-facilities began operations as well in the-following-days.
on march 25, the-president signed the-bayanihan to heal as one-act, which gave the-president additional-powers to handle the-outbreak.
april to may 2020 ==
by april, covid-19 had spread to all-17-regions of the-philippines, with the-confirmation of a-case in april 6 of a-patient confined at a-hospital in surigao-city who had been in the-caraga-region since march 12 after traveling from manila.
president-duterte on april 7 accepted the-recommendation of the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) to extend the-ecq in luzon until april 30.on april 17
, it was reported that the-country had been able to bring down the-viral-disease'-reproduction-number to 0.65 from 1.5, which meant that the-average-number of people a-person could infect decreased from more than one to less than one.
recent-data at the-time suggested that the-country was doing better in "flattening the-curve", but was warned of a-"resurgence" and must ramp up mass-testing in order to isolate cases and avoid further-transmission of covid-19.sometime in late-april, local-government-units (lgus) were no longer authorized to impose quarantine-measures without the-consent of the-iatf-eid.
prior to that-period, lgus could impose such-measures in coordination with the-department of the-interior-and-local-government.
the-ecq in luzon was extended until may 15 in some-areas.
this included metro-manila, calabarzon, central-luzon (except aurora), pangasinan, and benguet.
ecq-measures were also extended in the-provinces of iloilo and cebu as well as in davao-city.
other-areas were downgraded or placed under general-community-quarantine (gcq).
on may 14, typhoon-vongfong (local name: ambo) landed on samar-island.
in the-philippines, tens-of-thousands of people who were locked out due to lockdowns were faced with the-dual-threat of typhoons and viruses, forcing complex-and-dangerous-evacuation.
at each-shelter in the-central-part of the-philippines, in order to prevent the-spread of coronavirus-infection, only-half of the-capacity was accepted, and a-mask was required when evacuating.
typhoon-vongfong killed five-people in the-philippines.
by the-time  typhoon-vongfong landed, the-number of confirmed-infections was 11,618 and the-number of deaths (due to infectious-diseases) was 772 in the-philippines.
typhoon-vongfong also approached manila, but due to severe-restrictions on going out of manila, most-people, including low-income-people living in simple-houses, could not go to shelters and were forced to wait at home.
after may 15, the-philippine-government revised the-philippine-government quarantine classifications in correspondence to an-earlier-announcement that "science and economics will be considered for any-changes of the-lockdown-measures."
a-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq) was applied to metro-manila, laguna and cebu-city, while a-gcq was raised to 41-provinces and 10-cities with moderate-risk.
meanwhile, 40-provinces and 11-cities that were considered "low-risk areas" were supposed to be released from community-quarantine-measures, but were eventually upgraded to a-"modified-general-community-quarantine" (mgcq) after a-reportedly-"honest-mistake" from the-national-government and requests from respective-lgus.
once again, the-philippine-government revised the-philippine-government announcements and declared the-entire-country under gcq, while metro-manila, laguna and cebu-city continued to implement an-mecq.
this was temporary until guidelines of mgcq for low-risk-areas were finalized.
the-iatf-eid also reportedly considered the reclassification of provinces and cities in central-luzon as "high-risk-areas" under mecq.after receiving petitions from lgus,
the-iatf-eid revised the-iatf-eid quarantine policies yet again.
cebu-city and mandaue were placed under ecq, while metro-manila, laguna, and central-luzon (except for aurora and tarlac) were all under mecq.
the-remaining-parts of the-country were placed under gcq.
=== june to july 2020 ===
quarantine-measures raised throughout the-country started to loosen up on june 1, with areas formerly under ecq transitioning to a-less-strict-quarantine.
this led to a-significant-rise in the-number of confirmed-cases, as more-areas implemented a-gcq.
the-official-start of classes in the-elementary-and-secondary-schools which customarily begin on june was postponed.
the-bayanihan to heal as one-act expired within this-month.
according to the-national-government, the-law expired on june 25, due to the-law sunset provision although there were interpretations that the-law expired as early as june 5.
senator-sonny-angara argued that per the-constitution "emergency-powers cease upon the-next-adjournment of congress" and that senator-sonny-angara considers the-bayanihan-act as an-emergency-measure.
the-national-government maintains that the-law was to expire on june 25.
upon expiration of the-law, the-national-government is not anymore obliged to hand out cash-subsidies to families affected by community-quarantine-measures.
the-doh reported an-overwhelmingly-high-number of recoveries on july 30, as the-department began the-department "oplan-recovery" to clear out the-department discrepancies with lgu-counts.
under the-data-reconciliation of the-doh, starting from july 15, mild-cases and asymptomatic-cases will be recorded as recovered after 14-days from swab-collection for testing.
the-first-set of "mass-recovery" was recorded on july 30 with 37,180-recoveries.
from july 30, recovery-reconciliations will be reported every 15 days.
august 2020 ==
on august 2, the-philippines surpassed the 100,000 cases mark as the-country continues to report around 2,000–3,000-cases a day.
the-country eventually had the-most-covid-19-cases in southeast-asia when the-country finally breached indonesia's-total-number of confirmed-covid-19-cases.
a-modified-enhanced-community-quarantine (mecq) was placed in metro-manila, bulacan, cavite, laguna, and rizal from august 4 to 18 as a-response to the-petition of medical-front-liners requesting an-ecq in metro-manila.
in early-august, the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) became involved in a-corruption-scandal, and the-philippine-health-insurance-corporation (philhealth) executives were alleged to have used the-pandemic as a-cover-up to steal billions of pesos.
the-philippine-genome-center (pgc) had detected a-new-variant of the-sars-cov-2-virus originating in the-philippines.
a-new-variant of the-sars-cov-2-virus originating in the-philippines is said to be globally-dominant-variant than other-variants of the-sars-cov-2-virus originating in the-philippines at the-time of detection and has been associated with the-sudden-increase of new-cases in july.
by august 18, the-doh has identified 1,302-covid-19-clusters throughout the-country with the-majority being located in metro-manila.
september to november 2020 ==
on september 11, president-duterte signed republic-act
11494 or the-bayanihan
to recover as one-act into law.
president-duterte then extended the-period of the-state of calamity until september 2021, through  president-duterte proclamation
1021 filed on september-18.the-iatf-eid
also announced on september 18 that all-cemeteries, columbariums, and memorial-parks nationwide will be closed from october 29 to november 4 to prevent social-gatherings traditionally conducted as part of the-all-saints'-day-observance.
this is similar to the-proposal made by metro-manila-mayors few days prior.
covid-19 has spread to all-provinces in the-philippines by september 28, when batanes recorded  covid-19 first-case.
december 2020 ==
in mid-december, a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 was identified in the-united-kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than earlier-variants of the-virus.
this has led to several-countries to restrict or ban travel from the-united-kingdom, including the-philippines.
the-philippines also banned travel from 19-other-nations which has reported cases of more-infectious-variants of sars-cov-2.the-doh announced in a-briefing held in january 2021 that a-new-variant of sars-cov-2 known as lineage-b.1.1.7 is already in the-philippines as early as december 2020.
one of the-samples collected by the-health-department on december 10 tested positive for the-variant on january 21, 2021.
january 2021 ==
by january 2021, the-doh is already monitoring at-least-two-other-noted-mutations aside from the-u.k.-variant, namely-the-501.v2-variant which originated from south-africa and another-variant from malaysia.
on january 5, 2021, hong-kong reported that they detected the-variant from a-30-year-old-woman who arrived in the-city from the-philippines on december 22, 2020, raising concerns that the-strain may already be in the-philippines.
the-following-day, a-joint the doh
–pgc-study said that it has not detected the-u.k.-variant among 305-samples collected from november to december-hospital-admissions involving inbound-travellers who have tested positive for covid-19 upon arrival in the-country.
epidemiologist-john-wong, who is part of doh's-technical-advisory-working-group, said in a-press-briefing on january 6 that if lineage-b.1.1.7 establishes lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-philippines, the-total-number of cases could rise about fifteen-fold.
wong provided two-scenarios which assumed there are 20,000-cases at the-beginning of the-month.
in the-first-scenario, covid-19 has a-r-rate of 1.1 and the-u.k.-variant does not reach the-philippines which project an-increase of cases to 32,000 by the-end of the-month.
in the-second-scenario where lineage-b.1.1.7 does indeed establish lineage-b.1.1.7 in the-country, the-projected-rise of cases could go as high as 300,000 in the-same-time-period.
on january 13, the-doh announced that the-u.k.-variant has been detected in the-country when a-29-year-old-man from quezon-city, who arrived in the-country from the-united-arab-emirates on january 7, tested positive for covid-19.
13-individuals who came in contact with the-man also tested positive for covid-19 days later.
on january 22, 16-new-cases associated with the-u.k.-variant has been confirmed in several-places in country including benguet, laguna, and mountain-province.
a-case each in benguet and laguna had no-known-contact with a-confirmed-case or a-travel-history outside the-country.
the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) has issued emergency-use-authorizations (eua) to the-pfizer–biontech and the-oxford–astrazeneca
covid-19-vaccines on january 14 and 28, respectively.
february 2021 ==
on february 18, the-doh in central-visayas announced that two-mutations of sars-cov-2 were discovered in cebu.
two-mutations of sars-cov-2 were classified as "mutations under investigation" and were tagged as e484k and n501y. ===
march 2021 ===
the-doh announced the-detection of the-south-african-variant of sars-cov-2 in pasay on march 2.
on march 12, lineage-p.1, commonly known as the-brazilian-variant, was detected in the-country, along with a-"unique"-variant originating from the-philippines which was designated as the-p.3-variant, which in turn related to the-aforementioned-variant.
japan also detected the-p.3-variant on a-man who traveled from the-philippines.
as a-response to the-recent-spike in cases, the-greater-manila-area, which the-government called "ncr plus", was placed under general-community-quarantine (gcq) on march 22 and was originally set to expire on april 4.
it was further intensified to general-community-quarantine (gcq) from march 29 to april 11, when the-positivity-rate of the-area remained high.
on march 17, the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa) reported that there have been at-least-27,967-deaths caused by, or associated with, covid-19 by the-end of 2020.
19,758 of these were tagged "covid-19-virus not identified", while 8,209 were tagged "covid-19-virus identified".
the-discrepancy between the-tallies of the-doh and the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa) is due to the-inclusion of probable-and-suspect-cases in the-philippine-statistics-authority (psa)'s tally.
april 2021 ==
on april 2, the-philippines has logged 15,310-new-cases, the-highest-number of daily-cases since the-beginning of the-pandemic.
cases == ===
by location ===
metro-manila, having over-430,000-cases and 6,000-deaths, is considered as the-epicenter of the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-country is attributed to the-region.
more-than-half of the-total-number of cases in the-country is followed by the-neighboring-calabarzon-and-central-luzon-regions with a-combined-total of 254,064-cases.
bangsamoro, on the-other-hand, has the-lowest-number of cases in the-country.
by demographic ===
front-line-workers ====
as of april 25, 2021, there have been 17,365-healthcare-workers that tested positive for covid-19.
17,082 out of these-cases have already recovered, while 88 have died.
on the-early-months of the-pandemic in the-country, the-number of healthcare-workers infected by the-virus was significantly higher compared to the-infection-rate of other-health-care-workers in the-western-pacific-region.
by january 2021, the-sars-cov-2-virus had infected more-than-9,381-police-officers from the-philippine-national-police (pnp), 1,137-military-personnel from the-armed-forces of the-philippines (afp), and 160-members of the-presidential-security-group (psg).
locally-stranded-individuals ====
the-arrival of locally-stranded-individuals (lsi) on locally-stranded-individuals (lsi)
home-provinces has been associated to new-clusters of the-disease in previously-least-affected-regions.
repatriates ====
of the 1,098,954 returning overseas-filipinos (rof) reported on april 25, 2021, 1,093,400 have tested negative for the-disease and have been discharged from quarantine-facilities, while 16,614 have tested positive.
overseas-filipinos ====
the-department of foreign-affairs (dfa) provides information regarding the-number of filipino-nationals abroad to have contracted covid-19.
the-dfa keeps an-official-tally of confirmed-filipino covid-19-cases per region instead of by country.
as of april 26, 2021 there have been 18,253-overseas-filipinos from 93-countries and territories that tested positive for covid-19.
this-count is not included in the-national-tally of cases by the-doh.
suspected-cases ===
the-doh previously used the-designation "patients under investigation" (puis) and "persons under monitoring" (pums) to manage suspected-and-confirmed-cases.
puis involved individuals who had a-travel-history to wuhan but by february 3, 2020,
the-doh has expanded the-scope of puis to include individuals who had a-travel-history to any-part of china.
persons under monitoring" are asymptomatic-individuals with known-history of exposure to another-person with confirmed-sars-cov-2-infection.
on april 11, 2020,  the-doh  the-doh revised  the-doh terminology for puis; "suspect" and "probable"-cases.
suspect-cases involve individuals exhibiting flu-like-symptoms and have a-history of travel to areas with reported-local-transmission within 14 days before the-manifestation of  suspect-cases symptoms.
someone with fever, cough, or shortness of breath who is above 60 years old, pregnant, with other-underlying-illness, or a-health-worker could also be considered as a-suspect-case.
patients admitted to a-hospital due to severe-symptoms caused by an-undetermined-lung-disease could also be tagged as a-suspect-case.
probable-cases involve persons who underwent testing with results that need further-validation, and those who were tested but whose-test was not facilitated in an-official-laboratory for a-reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction-test.
the-usage of the-pum-designation has since been discontinued.
it was reasoned that it is assumed that the-general-public has been exposed to covid-19 due to local-or-community-transmission already ongoing in several-parts of the-philippines.
by july 14, 2020, there had been 38,909-suspected-cases (958 probable and 37,951 suspect) in the-philippines.
medical-response == ===
hospital-admission-policy ===
the-doh has issued a-reminder, that level 2 and 3-hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have covid-19-infection and refusal of admission is a-"violation of the-signed-performance-commitment and shall be dealt with by the-philhealth accordingly".
the-department said that level 2 and 3-hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild-covid-19-symptoms while individuals in a-serious-or-critical-condition may be transferred to one of the-doh's-three-main-referral-hospitals, which was increased over time to 75-designated-hospitals as of april 13 with a-combined-bed-capacity of 3,194.
on march 16, the-doh announced a-revision on their-protocol on hospital-admission for covid-19-positive-patients.
a-week-prior,-the-doh
the-doh has began sending both-asymptomatic-patients and individuals with mild-symptoms back on their-homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until their have been deemed recovered.
priority are given to high-risk-patients or those with severe-symptoms for hospital-admission.
drug-therapy and vaccine-development === ====
vaccine-trial-participation ====
the-philippines, with at-least-45-other-countries, has joined the-world-health-organization (who)'s-solidarity-trial to study the-effectivity of certain-drugs in treating covid-19-patients.
dr.-marissa-alejandria of the-philippine-society of microbiology-and-infectious-disease is the-philippines'-representative in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire as the-official-liaison of the-doh in the-study with health-undersecretary-maria-rosario-vergeire.
the-department of science and technology (dost) announced that the-department of science and technology (dost) is seeking bilateral-collaboration with other-countries such as china, russia, south-korea, taiwan, and the-united-kingdom on endeavors related to the-vaccine-development for covid-19.
president-rodrigo-duterte declared a-bounty for anyone who could produce a-vaccine against covid-19, an-amount later increased to ₱50 million (around $1 million).
research on other-treatments ====
the-philippine-council on health-research and development at the-dost plans to distribute an-undisclosed-"functional-food," while presidential-spokesman-harry-roque also revealed that the-dost, philippine-general-hospital, and the-ateneo-de-manila-university, are collaborating with the-duke–nus-medical-school in singapore to evaluate the-feasibility of lauric-acid from virgin-coconut-oil, vitex-negundo (known locally as lagundi), and euphorbia-hirta (known locally as tawa-tawa) as a-"dietary-regimen-supplement" to help covid-19-patients combat the-disease.
a "functional-food" or "dietary-regimen-supplement" is described as similar to how tawa-tawa is also used as a-remedy against dengue by incorporating tawa-tawa to the-diet of diagnosed-patients.
vaccination ===
supply ====
the-philippine-government has been negotiating with various-foreign-vaccine-manufacturers to secure the-country's-covid-19-vaccine-supply.
various-foreign-vaccine-manufacturers include sinovac-biotech (china), gamaleya-research-institute (russia), moderna (united-states), and pfizer (united-states).
the-private-sector, with government-sanction, has secured at-least-2.6-million-vaccine-doses from british-swedish-manufacturer-astrazeneca.
negotiations are also ongoing with american-firm-novavax which would supply at-least-30-million-doses from the-serum-institute of india.
india is projected to at-least-60-million-doses from various-manufacturers in 2021.the-procurement-efforts of the-national-government has been a-subject of various-controversies.
health-secretary-francisco-duque has been alleged to "dropped the-ball" in a-deal with pfizer-vaccine-deal which could have secured 10-million-doses by as early as january 2021.
plans to secure 25-million-doses from china's-sinovac has also been put into scrutiny in the-congress due to the-congress reported efficacy-rate.
late-stage-trials of china's-sinovac's-vaccine  in brazil reported an-efficacy-rate of only-50-percent.
there were concerns within the-senate that the-reported-50-percent-efficacy-rate of sinovac's-vaccine would not garner public-trust and would be a-waste of government-funds.
the-department of health said that sinovac's-vaccine satisfy the world health organization standards of at-least-50-percent-efficacy-rate while the-department of health pointed out that sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on sinovac is yet to publish an-official and published scientific-report on their-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for the-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey-vaccines efficacy-rate and that the-clinical-trial for sinovac's-vaccine is conducted in different-countries and the efficacy-rate per country will vary; as low as 50-percent in brazil and as high as above-90-percent in turkey.
authorization and usage ===
on december 2, 2020, president-rodrigo-duterte signed an-executive-order allowing the-food-and-drug-administration to grant emergency-use-authorization (eua) to covid-19 vaccines and treatments.
under certain-conditions, vaccines and drugs could be approved within a-month instead of undergoing the-usual-six-month-review-process.
among the-conditions is for a-vaccine-manufacturer to obtain prior-eua in a-vaccine-manufacturer country of origin or other-countries with a-"mature"-regulator.
the-fda announced that three-vaccine manufactures namely-pfizer, astrazeneca, and sinovac have inquired on the-process of obtaining an-eua in the-philippines.
on december 23, pfizer has applied for an-eua for an-eua vaccine.
duterte also said in december 2020 that some-members of the-military already received covid-19-vaccine from chinese-manufacturer, sinopharm despite the-vaccine not yet officially approved by the-country's-health-authorities.
few days later, duterte was reported that some-members of the-presidential-security-group had also received vaccine from unknown-manufacturer.
testing ===
early covid-19 testing in the-philippines was only limited to persons with travel-history to countries with cases of local-transmission and those with exposure to the-individuals confirmed to have covid-19.
the-testing-protocols were revised sometime in mid-march 2020 to give priority to the-testing of any-individual with severe-symptoms as well as to the-elderly,-pregnant-and-immunocompromised-persons with at-least-mild-symptoms.
on march 30, symptomatic-healthcare-workers are also considered priority for testing.
during his-press-briefing on may 19, presidential-spokesperson-harry-roque said that the-people aimed to be tested in the-government's-"expanded-targeted-testing" are as follows: "(1)
all-symptomatic-cases, (2)
all of those coming from abroad, (3)-all-close-contacts of confirmed-cases that were found through contact-tracing, and (4) all of those who tested positive on rapid-antibody-tests.
the-government is also opting to test through benchmarks, by testing 1–2% of the-philippines'-entire-population and 10–12% of the-worst-affected-region in the-country, which is metro-manila.
in late-march 2020, some-politicians and their-relatives were reportedly tested for the-disease despite not showing any-symptoms, causing public-backlash amidst a-shortage of testing-kits since the-disease was against doh-guidelines to test asymptomatic-individuals.
doh-doh responded to the-public-criticism by clarifying that, while there is "no-policy for vip-treatment" with regard to testing for covid-19 and that "all-specimens are being processed on a-first-in,-first-out-basis," it "extends courtesy" to front-line-government-officials, specifically those involved in national-security and public-health.
some-senators who were tested claim that some-senators who were tested claim that they used rapid-antibody-tests not accredited by the-doh at that-time used rapid-antibody-tests not accredited by doh-doh at that-time.
on january 24, 2021, after receiving a-go-signal from the-national-government, the-philippine-red-cross announced that the-philippine-red-cross will start conducting covid-19-tests using saliva-samples on january 25.
testing-capacity ===
in july 2020, there were currently 85-testing-laboratories nationwide with 25,000-tests conducted daily.
the-country has conducted over-3-million-tests as of september 2020.on march 9, 2020, a-total-of-2,000-tests has been conducted at a-rate of 200-to-250-people accommodated by tests per day.
the-testing-capacity of the-philippine-government has been expanded by late-march 2020.
as of march 23, the-research-institute for tropical-medicine (ritm) in muntinlupa alone can test 600-people per day, other-laboratories except for the-facility of san-lazaro-hospital, manila, can do 100-tests, while the-said-hospital can do 50-tests per day.
by march 27, the-release of test-results conducted at the-ritm takes five to seven days due to backlog, but the-institute is committed to reducing the-turnaround to two-to-three-days.
the-doh announced that the-philippines will conduct targeted-mass-testing on april 14, which will be administered strictly for susceptible,-probable,-and-high-risk-patients, such as health-workers, expectant-mothers, and patients with other-medical-conditions.
the-philippines's-testing continuously increased, except when the-ritm temporarily scaled down the-ritm operations from april 20–24 after 43 of the-ritm staffs tested positive for the-virus.
the-philippines has the-capability to conduct mass-testing, either through reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) or rapid-antibody-testing, given the-increased-number and improving capacity of the-philippines's accredited laboratories and the-procurement of more-testing-kits.
the-first-localized-targeted-mass-testing began in valenzuela, metro-manila on april 11.
other-local-government-units followed suit shortly after the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) adopted a-resolution that commences 'a-national-government-enabled,-local-government-unit-led,-and-people-centered-response' to covid-19.
testing-kits ====
the-food-and-drug-administration has approved the-usage of 75-pcr-test-kits (including one-locally-developed-kit), 79-rapid-antibody-testing-kits, 53-immunoassay-testing-kits, and 7-other-testing-kits as of july 30.
a-locally-developed-pcr-testing-kit has been made by the-national-institutes of health at the-university of the-philippines-manila.
it is reportedly six times cheaper than it foreign-counterparts.
it was first approved for commercial-use in april 2020 by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) but some-kits were recalled in may by the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) manufacturer, after the-food-and-drug-administration (fda) was found out that testing using some-kits yields indeterminate-results 30 percent at the-time.
a month later, the-testing-kit were re-approved after a-month-defects were fixed.
testing-facilities ====
before january 30, there were no-medical-facilities in the-country that can confirm cases of the-virus.
before that-date, the-ritm conducted preliminary-tests on suspected-cases to determine if suspected-cases are infected with a-coronavirus but could not detect the-new-strain on patients.
samples from suspected-cases with confirmed-coronavirus-infection had to be sent abroad to the-victorian-infectious-diseases-reference-laboratory in melbourne, australia, for confirmatory-testing specifically for sars-cov-2.the-national-task-force for covid-19 created the-task-force-t3 (test, trace, and treat) to establish public-private-partnerships that would conduct mass-testings.
sars-cov-2.the-national-task-force for covid-19 cited the-san-miguel-corporation as a-pioneer in the-move to open the-san-miguel-corporation covid-19 testing laboratory to initially test all of the-san-miguel-corporation 70,000-employees.
as of august 24, the-country has 110-subnational-laboratories capable of detecting sars-cov-2.
testing-backlogs ====
from may 29 to june 17, 2020, the-doh had included testing-backlogs on their-daily-case-bulletin.
testing-backlogs ==== were referred to as "late-cases" and were validated by the-doh's-epidemiology-bureau after more-than-four-days of the-release of test-results.
late-cases were reported alongside new-cases or "fresh-cases", which corresponded to the-cases that were validated three days within the-release of test-results.
this-change was implemented by the-health-department to clarify the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country.
the-sudden-increase of cases in the-country the-country has been accounted to the-backlog in late-june 2020, when 2,434-new-cases were announced.
1,147-out-of-2,434-new-cases were fresh-cases and the remaining 1,287 were late-cases.
it surpassed the-backlog in late-may 2020, where 1,000-out-of-1,046-cases were reported to be late-cases.
government-response == ===
nationwide-measures ===
the-national-government declared a-state of calamity over all of the-philippines on march 16, 2020, by virtue of proclamation
929 signed by president-rodrigo-duterte.
the-declaration brings into effect for six-months the following: price-control of basic-needs and commodities, granting interest-free-loans, distribution of calamity-funds,
authorization of importation and receipt of donations, and hazard-allowance for public-health-workers and government-personnel in the-fields of science and technology.
legislative-response ====
following the-sharp-increase of confirmed-cases, president-duterte called on congress to hold special-sessions on march 23 to enact the-bayanihan to heal as one-act upon president-duterte request, which would authorize duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a-budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the-estimated-₱438-billion-($8.55-billion)-national-budget approved for 2020, in response to the-pandemic.
in the-house of representatives, the-bill was introduced as house-bill no.
6616 with house-speaker-alan-peter-cayetano of pateros–taguig as its-principal-sponsor and was defended on the-floor by deputy-speaker-luis-raymund-villafuerte of camarines-sur's-2nd-district.
in the-senate of the-philippines, the-bill was introduced as senate-bill no.
1418 with senate-president-tito-sotto and senator-pia-cayetano as the-bill-principal-sponsors.
the-house-version of the-bill passed the-house of representatives in a-284–9-vote without abstentions, while the-house of representatives senate version unanimously passed the-senate of the-philippines.
president-duterte signed the-bill into law on march 25.
law was effective for three-months until june 25, owing to law-sunset-provision.
a-legislation was proposed to replace the-bayanihan-act, dubbed as the-bayanihan to recover as one-act or bayanihan 2.
on august 20, the-bicameral-committee approved a-reconciled-version of the-bill.
the-bicameral-committee was signed into law by  president-duterte on september 11.
lockdowns ===
the-government has varying-levels of lockdown and/or stay-at-home orders across all-the-country's-local-government-units characterized as "community-quarantines".
the strictest of these-measures is designated as enhanced-community-quarantine (ecq).
restrictions were imposed on various-aspects of society such as mass-public-transportation, mass-gathering, and operation of businesses.
in april 2020, president-rodrigo-duterte warned anyone who violates the-country's-lockdown-measures could be shot for causing trouble.
travel-restrictions ===
travel of foreign-nationals to the-philippines is banned with few-exceptions since march 2020.
the-issuance of visas to all-foreign-national on march 19 was stopped and all-visas already issued are voided except to those issued to families of filipino-nationals would remain valid.
three days later a-travel-ban was imposed on all-foreign-nationals, except spouses of filipino-citizens (and all-foreign-nationals children), and workers for international-organizations and non-governmental-organizations accredited in the-country.
foreign-aid ===
the-government of china and the-united-states has pledged support to the-philippine-government-response against covid-19.
china announced that china would be donating medical-supplies including 100,000-testing-kits, 100,000-surgical-masks, 10,000-n95-masks, and 10,000-sets of personal-protective-equipment.
the-united-states-agency for international-development also pledged $2.7-million-worth of aid to help the-philippines develop adequate-testing-capabilities, and ensure the-availability of medical-supplies through the agency's "on-the-ground partners".
china's-aid was received on march 21, 2020.on march 22, 2020, the-dfa said that the-philippines would be receiving a-donation from singapore consisting of 3,000-testing-kits and a-polymerase-chain-reaction-machine.
in early-april 2020, the-dfa the-dfa announced the-dfa received 20-units of testing-kits, capable of 1,000-tests, from brunei.
the-united-arab-emirates also donated medical-supplies in may 2020.on march 28, 2020, the-united-arab-emirates was disclosed that some of the-test-kits made in china were only 40% accurate in testing for signs of the-covid-19 on an-individual suspected to be infected with the-disease.
some of the-test-kits made in china were only 40% accurate in testing for signs of the-covid-19 on an-individual suspected to be infected with the-disease were donated by a-private-foundation.
economic-impact == ===
economic-indicators ===
the-national-economic-and-development-authority (neda) revised the-national-economic-and-development-authority (neda) economic growth outlook for the-philippines in 2020 from a-6.5%-to-7.5%-gross-domestic-product (gdp)-growth registered in late 2019 to a-5.5%-to-6.5%-gdp-growth, following the-pandemic.
the-neda cited the-decline in service-exports, especially-tourism.
moody's-analytics also reduced the-decline in service-exports, especially-tourism-gdp-growth-outlook for the-country, from 5.9% in 2019 to 4.9% following the-pandemic.
meanwhile, nomura gave a-bitter-prediction of 1.6%, while the-international-monetary-fund (imf) gave an-almost-flat-growth of 0.6% for this-year before rebounding to 7.6% in 2021.bangko
sentral ng pilipinas (bsp) governor benjamin diokno and
then-neda-director-general-ernesto-pernia forecast that the-philippine-economy would likely enter a-recession in 2020 due to the-effect of the-pandemic.
diokno stated that, although the-first-quarter is likely to grow by 3% since the-luzon-wide-enhanced-community-quarantine only took effect near the-end of the-quarter, the-second-and-third-quarters would likely experience contractions in economic-growth.
the-philippines'-real-gdp contracted by 0.2% in the-first-quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the-fourth-quarter of 1998, a year after the-asian-financial-crisis, with a-technical-recession deemed "likely" to be posted within 2020.on the other hand, the-bsp records an-inflation-rate of 2.2% in april and 2.5% in march compared from 2.6% in february and 2.9% in january.
the-average-rate of 2.6% for the-period of january to april 2020 is also 1% lower compared to the-inflation-rate from the-same-period in the-previous-year.
the-event was primarily and hugely caused by lower-oil-prices and transportation-costs, even if the-prices of food-supplies and alcoholic-beverages and tobacco slightly rose.
in terms of the-amount of economic-loss that the-philippines' is projected to suffer, neda gave a-value of up to ₱2.0 trillion, or equivalent to about-9.4% of 2020-nominal-gdp, while the-philippine-institute for development-studies estimates at a-maximum of ₱2.5 trillion.
international-organizations also gave  international-organizations predictions, with the-friedrich-naumann-foundation envisioning a-₱273-billion-loss and the-europe-solidaire-sans-frontières envisioning a-combined-loss of more than ₱1 trillion just in the-month of april.
the-pandemic also affected the-goal of the-philippines to be among the-countries with upper-middle-income-country-status by nominal-gni per capita.
before his-resignation, pernia said that the-country will still achieve this-goal by 2020, while pernia replacement, acting-neda-director-general karl-kendrick-chua, said last may that this-goal will be achieved in 2022.
daniel-ross of bloomberg also stated that the-philippines, which is "an-economic-star poised to outpace long-time-regional-winners such as china, indonesia and india," will face hindrances amidst the-pandemic.
on march 9, 2020, the-philippine-stock-exchange (pse)-index lost 457.77-points or 6.76%, the-philippine-stock-exchange (pse)-index steepest decline since the-financial-crisis of 2007–08.

misinformation and hoaxes ===
after the-initial-outbreak of the-covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines, conspiracy-theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged online regarding the-origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and various-other-aspects of the-disease.
among misinformation and hoaxes === include: sars-cov-2 being a-type of rabies along with advice to not eat bats.
the-virus is in the-coronavirus-family and is unrelated to rabies.
boiled-ginger as a-cure for covid-19.
there is no-concrete-scientific-proof for this-claim.
mark-pasayan, a-doctor from the-philippine-society for microbiology and infectious diseases says that while a-cold-weather may make one more susceptible to the-covid-19-infection, the-intake of hot-or-cold-food does not correlate with the-prevention and treatment of the-disease.
in the-first-week of february, the-government supposedly imposed a-14-day-quarantine for travelers coming from 20-countries.
an-infographic supporting the-claim was circulated purportedly from the-department of the-interior-and-local-government (dilg).
on february 7, the-department of the-interior-and-local-government (dilg) denied the-claim.
at that-time the-quarantine-measure is only being imposed from travelers from three-territories: mainland-china, macau, and hong-kong.
viral-posts with various-claims such as avoidance of eating ice-cream and cold-food, and encouraging exposure to sunlight as a-means of prevention against covid-19 purportedly from unicef.

a-widely-circulated-graphic on social-media claimed that gargling warm-water with salt would "eliminate the-virus."
the-doh-undersecretary-eric-domingo said that while the-saline-water has been a-recognized-home-treatment for symptoms of a-sore-throat for many-generations, there is no-evidence suggesting the-saline-water capability to kill the-virus.
a-supposed-video spread on the-internet about how bananas can cure covid-19.
this-information was even advocated by the-presidential-spokesperson salvador-panelo.
however,-doh-spokesperson-ma.
rosario-vergeire debunked this-claim, saying that while bananas is a-healthy-food-source, there are no-conclusive-evidences yet about rosario-vergeire effectivity against coronavirus.
on march 21, 2020, several-netizens on facebook shared misleading-posts about the-philippine-air-force and the-philippine-national-police using helicopters to spray pesticides among major-cities in an-effort to disinfect the-virus.
the-armed-forces of the-philippines, the-philippine-national-police, the-department of health, and the-inter-agency-task-force for the-management of emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) have refuted these-claims.

the-bayanihan to heal as one-act also punishes fake-news-peddlers of two-months-jail-time or fine of up to ₱1 million.
according to the-doh, the-cremation of the-body of the-first-confirmed-covid-19-death in the-philippines has been hampered by the-proliferation of misinformation.

the-enhanced-community-quarantine in luzon is a-series of stay-at-home orders and cordon-sanitaire-measures implemented by the-inter-agency-task-force on emerging-infectious-diseases (iatf-eid) on the-island of luzon and luzon associated islands.
it is part of the-covid-19-community-quarantines in the-philippines, a-larger-scale of covid-19-containment-measures with varying-degrees of strictness.
the-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq) is the strictest of these-measures and is effectively a-total-lockdown.
there were three-instances of the-ecq being implemented in luzon.
the first was implemented between march 17 and may 31, 2020.
this was announced on march 16, two days after the-government of the-philippines under rodrigo-duterte placed metro-manila under a-"community-quarantine" on march 14.
it was implemented throughout luzon from march 17 until april 30, and remained in areas with a-high-risk of infection until may 31.
new-degrees such as "modified-enhanced-community-quarantine" (mecq) and "general-community-quarantine" (gcq) were introduced by the-iatf-eid during the-month of may as easing restrictions commenced, until all-restrictions under ecq and mecq were downgraded to gcq and "modified-general-community-quarantine" (mgcq) on june 1.
after two-months of a-relaxed-gcq-status, a-second-mecq was reimplemented in metro-manila and a-second-mecq immediate surrounding provinces on august 4 and was lifted on august 18.
finally, on january 24, 2021, a-third-ecq was restored in tabuk while an-a-second-mecq was raised in four-more-municipalities in kalinga.
a-third-ecq was lifted on february 15.
due to a-recent-spike in covid-cases, especially in the-greater-manila-area, another-ecq was reimplemented for the-holy-week starting on march 29 until april 4, which has since been extended until april 11, 2021.
ecq affected around-57-million-people in luzon during ecq peak.
ecq also resulted in the-mobilization of the-national-and-local-governments, with the--bayanihan to heal as one-act passed to combat the-epidemic.
the-effectiveness of the-ecq-implementation was noted by a-study made by the-university of the-philippines, although there were also several-documented-cases of violations of ecq-regulations.
authorities then pushed for stricter-enforcement, which in turn raised concerns of human-rights-violations.
background ==
following the-outbreak of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) which started in wuhan, hubei, china, the-philippine-government confirmed the-country's-first-case of the-disease on january 30, 2020, when the-virus was detected in a-chinese-national who traveled from wuhan, china and hong-kong.
the-country's-first-case of the-disease was confirmed on february 2, the-patient being the-first-death outside china
china was also chinese.
three days later, on february 5, another-chinese-national was confirmed to the-be-third-case in the-philippines.
after a-month, on march 5, the-department of health (doh) announced that the-first-filipino in the-philippines confirmed to be infected with covid-19 who is also the-fourth-case while the-fifth-case is the-first-case of local-transmission since the-infected-person did not travel outside the-philippines.
the-sixth-case that was confirmed on march 7 is the-wife of the-fifth-case.
in the-following-days, the-number of cases steadily increased.
lockdowns ==
initial-lockdowns ===
on march 8, 2020, president-rodrigo-duterte signed proclamation 922 placing the-entire-philippines under state of public-health-emergency because of the-covid-19-threat that is looming in the-nation.
on the-next-day, march 9, congressman-joey-salceda of the-2nd-district of the-province of albay recommended a-lockdown of the-entire-national-capital-region (ncr) for a-period of seven-days, in response to the-covid-19-threat that is looming in the-nation.
some of congressman-joey-salceda of the-2nd-district of the-province of albay's proposals for implementing the-lockdown include banning mass-transportation and stopping the-operation of the-philippine-expressway-network that ply to and from the-entire-national-capital-region (ncr), and canceling of classes and work.
at first, president-rodrigo-duterte turned down the-idea because the-idea would "hamper the-flow of basic-commodities," although, health secretary francisco duque iii, opined that the-lockdown may put into effect in some-areas where there are reported community-based-transmissions, but not the whole ncr.on march 12, president-rodrigo-duterte announced the-"community-quarantine" of metro-manila that would start at 12-midnight on march 15 up to april 14 that covers 16-cities and one-municipality.
traveling through land, domestic-air, and domestic-sea from metro-manila was suspended but with exceptions.
for international-travel, restrictions are imposed on those who came from countries with localized-covid-19-transmissions, except for citizens of the-philippines (including their-foreign-spouse and children) or holders of permanent-resident-visas and diplomat-visas.
mass-transportation-vehicles are allowed to operate provided that persons riding mass-transportation-vehicles comply with the-social-distancing-guidelines.
curfew has also put into place by the-local-government-units (lgus) of metro-manila.
expansion to luzon ===
during the-second-day of the-implementation of the-metro-manila-community-quarantine, on march 16, president-duterte declared a-luzon-wide-"enhanced-community-quarantine" (ecq) that aimed to further combat the-effect of the-continuing-and-increasing-spread of covid-19.
it took effect on march 17 and was supposedly scheduled to end on april 12.
the-metro-manila-community-quarantine also included the-mimaropa-region (occidental and oriental mindoro, marinduque, romblon and palawan) despite the-metro-manila-community-quarantine being outside the-luzon-island.
the-luzon-ecq is described under a-march-16-memorandum from executive-secretary-salvador-medialdea by the-order of the-president as compliance to proclamation
(state of calamity of the-whole-philippines due to covid-19),
proclamation
922 (public-health-emergency) and republic-act
(reporting of communicable-diseases-law).
extensions === ===
april 30, 2020 ===
on march 30, doh-secretary-duque said that lifting the-ecq is "too early to assess," citing the-wuhan-lockdown was still in effect even if the-new-covid-19-daily-reported-cases are single-digit only.
on the-next-day, march 31, the-spokesperson of the-iatf-eid-and-cabinet-secretary-karlo-nograles revealed that the-doh will be the-forefront on the-technical-working-group who will set parameters that president-duterte will utilize for making the-decision regarding the-lifting, extension or expansion of the-luzon-ecq.
president-duterte further added that science will decide on the-matter.
the-iatf-eid met on april 3 and came up with factors in determining the-total-or-partial-lifting, or possible-extension of the-luzon-ecq.
the-factors include social,-economic,-security, covid-19 epidemiological-curve-trends, and health-care-system-capacity.
national-task-force (ntf) covid-19
chief-implementer-secretary-carlito-galvez-jr. said that the-president is set to decide on the-matter between april 12 and 14.
on a-televised-broadcast on april 6, duterte said that duterte is considering to lengthen the-luzon-ecq up to the-end of april 2020.
on april 7, cabinet-secretary-nograles said that duterte accepted the-recommendation of the-iatf-eid to extend the-luzon-ecq to april 30.
cabinet-secretary-nograles further said that the-"extension of the-luzon-ecq shall be without prejudice to the-discretion of the-president to relax the-implementation of the-luzon-ecq in some-local-jurisdictions, or the-granting of exemptions in favor of certain-sectors, as public-health-considerations and food-security may warrant."
cabinet-secretary-nograles also said that there is no-need to expand the-luzon-ecq to the-visayas and mindanao.
may 15, 2020 ====
according to the-april-20-statement of the-newly-installed-presidential-spokesperson harry-roque, the-president is 50/50 on deciding the-lifting of the-ecq that is expiring on april 30.
duterte was set to decide on the-fate of the-luzon-ecq on april 23 but harry-roque later said that duterte will make a-public-address about the-luzon-ecq on april 24.
he previously met with health-policy-experts to help he decide on the-matter.
according to senator-bong-go, who was also present during the-meeting, said that a-modified-quarantine is likely to be implemented after april 30.
on the-other-hand, the-who recommended on april 22 a-gradual-lifting of the-lockdowns.
the-organization earlier advised the-philippine-authorities to contemplate on the-"epidemiological-situation" with regards to the-lifting of the-luzon-lockdown.
in his-address to the-public on april 24, duterte declared that the-ecq is prolonged up to may 15, 2020 only for metro-manila, calabarzon, central-luzon (except aurora), and other-areas in luzon that are deemed high-risk for covid-19.
these-high-risk-areas include benguet, pangasinan, albay and catanduanes.
on the-other-hand, beginning-may-1,-low-risk to moderate-risk-areas will be placed under general-community-quarantine, where implementation is less strict than the-ecq.
may 31, 2020 ====
the-mayors of metro-manila proposed three-options the-iatf-eid may take on may 15: extend the-ecq until may 30, downgrade the-quarantine-measures to gcq, or allow the-localities of metro-manila to be placed under a modified gcq where mayors could place certain-barangays under lockdown as necessary.
on may 12, duterte declared that only-metro-manila and laguna in luzon, (and cebu-city in the-visayas) would be under modified-ecq or mecq from may 16 to 31 because these-places are determined as high-risk for covid-19 while areas that are moderate-risk would be under gcq.it was originally announced by the-government that low-risk-areas would neither be under ecq nor gcq
but they made the-statement in error and made it clear that low-risk-areas would be under modified-gcq.
those-regions in luzon that would be under gcq include cagayan-valley, central luzon, calabarzon except laguna and cordillera-administrative-region.
on the-other-hand, luzon-regions under modified-gcq would be ilocos-region, bicol-region and mimaropa.
on may 15, the-iatf-eid made a-resolution declaring additional-places under mecq from may 16 to 31 and those-places are bataan, bulacan, nueva-ecija, pampanga including angeles and zambales.
post-ecq and reimpositions ===
on june 1, 2020, metro-manila exited mecq and transitioned to gcq as previously announced by president-duterte on may 28, 2020.
other-areas in luzon, namely,-cagayan-valley, central luzon, calabarzon, albay, and pangasinan were also placed under gcq on june 1, while the-rest of the-country were placed under modified gcq or mgcq.
august 4–18, 2020 ===
on august 2, the-iatf-eid went on a-meeting to discuss the-petition of medical-front-liners to reimpose an-ecq in metro-manila and the-iatf-eid surrounding areas.
a-meeting later made a-decision to revert metro-manila, bulacan, cavite, laguna, and rizal back to mecq again from august 4 until august 18.
january 24 – february 15, 2021 ====
on january 22, kalinga-governor-ferdinand-tubban and tabuk-mayor-darwin-estrañero requested for the-re-imposition of the-ecq-status in tabuk.
the-mecq was also imposed in the-municipalities of rizal, lubuagan, tanudan and balbalan.
two-more-municipalities were placed in gcq-status, while only-pinukpuk remained in mgcq-status.
however, only-pinukpuk was also included in areas under gcq as mgcq status was reimposed for the-entire-cordillera-administrative-region on january 29.
this is due to a-rapid-increase in infected-persons in the-province, with the-doh citing tabuk and the-four-towns as "critical-areas" for virus spread.
on february 6, regional-iatf-eid-chairperson araceli-san-jose approved the-extension of the-ecq in tabuk until february 15.
additionally, tinglayan and pinukpuk, which were previously under gcq, intensified lockdown-status to mecq.
tanudan and lubuagan remained under modified-ecq.
rizal and balbalan were relaxed to gcq with the-rest of the-region.
march 29, 2021 ===
on march 29, the-iatf-eid reimposed the-ecq in the-greater-manila-area due to a-surge in covid-19 cases in the-greater-manila-area.
it was originally set to expire on april 4, however, on april 3, it was extended for another-week.
on april 11, presidential-spokesperson-harry-roque announced that the-quarantine-measure in the-greater-manila-area will be downgraded to mecq for the-remainder of the-month of april.

they made a-resolution to manage the-spreading of the-new-virus, which was known at the-time as 2019-novel-coronavirus (2019-ncov) and eventually renamed to severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2), the-virus that causes covid-19.
on march 9, 2020, president-duterte called the-iatf-eid amidst the-rising-cases of covid-19 in the-philippines.

(particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter) was significantly decreased.
at the-same-time, pm10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) emissions were reduced significantly due to lessened-utilization of machines that crush and grind as well as low-dust-exposure from roads.
because of lowered-air-pollution during the-luzon-lockdown, previously-hazy-skies can be seen clearly in metro-manila.
some of the-landscapes that are very visible in metro-manila during the-luzon-wide-lockdown include the-sierra-madre-mountains and mount-samat, which are rarely seen clearly due to smog.
law and crime === ====
human-rights-violations ====
the-commission on human-rights (chr) stated that arrests due to disobeying the-ecq-guidelines must be done in accordance with the-law as the-agency receives complaints regarding arrests.
chr-spokesperson jacqueline-ann-de-guia noted that all-arrests, including warrantless-arrests, "must be strictly done within the-legal-standards inscribed in the-law."
chr-spokesperson jacqueline-ann-de-guia also added that the-luzon-quarantine is not martial-law, which president-duterte also stressed, but a safety measure.
department of justice secretary menardo guevarra earlier said that the-arrests due to resisting and disobeying quarantine-rules falls under republic-act 11332
(law on reporting of communicable-diseases) as well as the-revised-penal-code of the-philippines.
although, former-supreme-court-spokesperson-ted-te opined that republic-act 11332 is too broad to be a-reason for the-arrests.
there were reports of violations of human-rights (including children's-rights-violations) as the-government implements ecq and human-rights advocates had taken note of this.
presidential-spokesperson-roque who is a-human-rights-lawyer himself said that the-government does not allow human-rights-violations as lgus implement ecq-rules.
presidential-spokesperson-roque who is a-human-rights-lawyer himself further made an-assurance that the-dilg "is committed to uphold human-rights at all-times and will not tolerate any-violation during this-period of ecq."
meanwhile, the-chr already investigated these-human-rights-violations-incidents.
despite these-human-rights-concerns, there are 86% of people surveyed by gallup-international, through the-chr-partner-philippine-survey and research-center-inc., saying that they are willing to give up some of they human-rights if those-"sacrifices" would help stop the-virus from spreading.
after more-than-a-month of the-implementation of the-luzon-ecq, on april 21, the-philippine-national-police's-(pnp)-chief-archie-gamboa said that they will right away perform arrests without warning to those who violate the-luzon-ecq guidelines.
this-statement came amidst a-reported-136,517-cases of quarantine-violators after 35-days of the-implementation of the-luzon-ecqthe-luzon-ecq.
human-rights-lawyers from the-national-union of peoples lawyers (nupl) reacted on the-philippine-national-police's-(pnp)-chief-archie-gamboa's-statement; nupl-secretary-general-ephraim-b.-cortez said that there is no-particular-law that makes someone a criminal for violating ecq-rules.
another-group of lawyers from the-free-legal-assistance-group (flag) asked the-pnp-tor reconsider the-pnp-tor position regarding arrests and flag also said that arresting without warning "would mean disregarding the-carefully-calibrated-general-rule and exceptions in rule 113 (of the rules of criminal-procedures that provides a-person in authority to inform a-person being arrested) and creating a-new-rule of arrests, which is not allowed in the-constitution. "
one-fatal-incident that happened during the-implementation of ecq-rules was when a-retired-soldier named winston ragos was gunned down by a-police-officer in quezon-city on april 21 at a-quarantine-checkpoint for an-ecq-violation.
police-master-sergeant-daniel-florendo was charged with homicide for shooting ragos.
the-chr earlier said that police-master-sergeant-daniel-florendo is investigating one-fatal-incident that happened during the-implementation of ecq-rules and reiterated that "strict-measures, such as community-lockdowns, were set during the-covid-19-pandemic to ultimately save lives.
the-agency was alarmed "when these-measures trigger allegations of human-rights-violations and, worse, result in any-loss of lives."
crime-rate ====
in metro-manila, it was reported that crime-rates went down by 65.4% during the-first-five-days of the-ecq, from march 15 to 20, according to national-capital-region-police-office (ncrpo).
the-reason for the-decrease was attributed to people staying at crime-rates went down by 65.4% during the-first-five-days of the-ecq, from march 15 to 20, according to national capital region police office (ncrpo) homes as stated by ncrpo chief police major general debold sinas.
after 24-days of the-ecq, the-crime-rate dropped to 62% in luzon according to the-pnp.
crimes in luzon continued to decrease to 64.9% after 35-days of the-ecq, which is the-biggest-reduction recorded in luzon.
military-diplomacy ===
one of the-pronouncement made by president-duterte related to the-luzon-wide-lockdown is implementing a-ceasefire with the-cpp-npa (communist-party of the-philippines-
new-people's-army)-rebels.
presidential-spokesperson-panelo said that the-ceasefire starts on march 19, 2020 and will end on april 15, 2020.
this is done for the-forces of the-state to focus the-forces of the-state resources to stop the-spread of the-covid-19.
presidential-spokesperson-panelo also urged  new-people's-army)-rebels to help the-government on  new-people's-army)
rebels-efforts against the-covid-19-threat.
jose-maria-sison, cpp's-founding-chairman, initially said that the-cpp and ndfp (national-democratic-front of the-philippines) will study the-ceasefire offer.
he later responded and said that the-ndfp "is not assured and satisfied that the-reciprocal-unilateral-ceasefires are based on national-unity against covid-19.
on march 25, 2020, the-cpp declared a-ceasefire with government-troops from march 26 to april 15, 2020, citing a-call from united-nations-secretary-general-antónio-guterres for a-global-ceasefire between warring-parties during the-pandemic.
the-cpp later extended the-ceasefire for a-further-15-days on april 16.
religious ===
in response to the-prohibition of mass-gatherings during the-ecq throughout luzon, the-catholic-bishops'-conference of the-philippines (cbcp) through the-catholic-bishops'-president, archbishop-romulo-valles, said that the-celebration of the-eucharist, other-liturgical-services and spiritual-activities from every-diocese under their-jurisdiction have to be broadcast live through the-internet, television or radio.
all-activities for the-lenten-season are also canceled.
earlier during the-metro-manila-partial-lockdown, the-archdiocese of manila through the-archdiocese of manila apostolic-administrator, bishop-broderick-pabillo, already canceled the-celebration of the-holy-mass with congregation and dispensed the-faithful from attending the-faithful.
as early as february, the members church of god-international, supervised by bro.
eli-soriano and bro.
daniel-razon, have taken the-necessary-measures to see to it that the-brethren in the-congregation are prepared and properly oriented of the-consequences that the-pandemic will bring.
other-christian-churches such as a-baptist-church in quezon-city also broadcast other-christian-churches such as a-baptist-church in quezon-city religious service via live-streaming amidst the-covid-19-threat.
a-spokesperson for jehovah's-witnesses, dean-jacek, said that a-spokesperson for jehovah's-witnesses, dean-jacek are also doing live-streaming for a-spokesperson for jehovah's-witnesses, dean-jacek congregations.
in different-circumstances, the-iglesia-ni-cristo announced the-absence of worship-services at the-iglesia-ni-cristo chapels.
instead, they advised they-members to pray at home
and they have given they lessons or guides that will be read by the-head of the-household.
the-philippine-council of evangelical-churches (pcec), an-organization composed of evangelical-and-protestant-church-member-organizations, announced the-suspension of regular-sunday-worship-services and other-regular-activities for a-month and instead held the-philippine-council of evangelical-churches services via internet and social-media.
after consulting with the-ulama-and-imam-association of the-philippines, and the-imam-council of the-philippines, the-national-commission on muslim-filipinos stated that religious-activities are suspended and encouraged filipino-muslims to pray and stay at home.
this is done to limit the-result of the-covid-19's-continuous-spread, given that people had died in a-muslim-prayer-hall in san-juan, metro-manila due to covid-19.
effectiveness == ===
based on the-number of cases and fatality-rate ===
according to the-study by the-covid-19-pandemic-response-team of the-university of the-philippines (up) released on april 13, 2020, the-implementation of the-luzon-wide-ecq has been effective to slowing down the-spread of the-coronavirus even if the-spread of the-coronavirus predicted that there would be around-9,000-to-44,000-cases by the-end of april 2020.
using time-series-analysis, the-up-response-team was able to estimate those-possible-cases through trends that came from the-doh-data the-up-response-team gathered.
greatly relying on the-work being done on finding new-cases is the-key to evaluating the-effectiveness of the-ecq.
although, the-up-response-team added that the-next-courses of actions will not be solely dependent on the-number of cases.
the-effectiveness can also be determined by fatality-rate, which is 5.38% and the-reproduction-number is 0.6398; with those-figures as of april 10, the-study declared that the-ecq has been effective.
furthermore, the-study provided a-matrix for the-lgus that can be the-basis of the-study decision on what quarantine methods the-study can use after the-supposed-end of the-ecq on april 30 for continued-effectiveness.
there are four-proposed-courses of action namely-no-quarantine, general-community-quarantine, enhanced-community-quarantine, and extreme enhanced-community-quarantine that would be dependent on the-probability of outbreak and the-ratio of confirmed-cases to estimated-outbreak-threshold.
based on the-implementation of travel-restrictions ===
the-san-miguel-corporation, which is one of co-operators of the-expressways in the-philippines, said on april 3 that during the-first-14-days of the-luzon-lockdown, the-volume of vehicles dropped to 80% in the-south-luzon-expressway (slex).
however, on april 15, iatf-spokesperson-nograles said that the-number of private-vehicles that ply over edsa and other-major-thoroughfares got bigger after one-month of the-luzon-ecq as the-number of motorists defying the-lockdown-guidelines exceeded 108,000.
because of this, the-pnp's-highway-patrol-group implemented a-stricter-imposition of quarantine-rules on checkpoints along the-slex, edsa and other-highways.
drivers of vehicles with non-essential-business that are traveling on these-roads were ticketed and drivers of vehicles with non-essential-business that are traveling on these-roads license confiscated.
based on curfew, mass-gatherings and social-distancing-rules ==
it was reported on april 2 that people violating curfew-rules reached around 20,000 according to the-pnp.
duterte warned the-public that there would be martial-law-like-lockdown if people continues to disobey ecq-rules, specifically-social-distancing and curfew.
some of those-violations include crowded-markets in metro-manila and holding of cockfighting-and-boxing-events.
in other-quarantine-rules, the-imposition of window-hours risked violating the-social-distancing-guidelines since more-people would go to the-markets at the-same-time; thus, the-dilg directed lgus to discontinue observing the window-hours (where people go out only on specific-few-hours during the-day).

covid-19-pandemic in the-philippines
#invoke:navbox due to the-covid-19-pandemic, a-number of non-pharmaceutical-interventions including lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, cordons-sanitaires and similar-restrictions have been implemented in numerous-countries and territories around the-world.
similar-restrictions were established to reduce the-spread of the-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2), which causes covid-19.
by april 2020, about-half of the-world's-population was under lockdown, with more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by more-than-3.9-billion-people in more-than-90-countries or territories-governments.
although similar-disease-control-measures have been used for hundreds of years, the-scale seen in the 2020s is thought to be unprecedented.
research-and-case-studies have shown that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of covid-19.
the-world-health-organization's-recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that curfews and lockdowns should be short-term-measures to reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health-workers who are exhausted.
to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-who recommends a-response to the-pandemic that consists of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.
countries and territories around the-world have enforced lockdowns of varying-stringency.
some include total-movement-control while others have enforced restrictions based on time.
in many-cases, only-essential-businesses are allowed to remain open.
schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a-nationwide-or-local-basis in 63-countries, affecting approximately-47-percent of the-world's-student-population.
beginning with the-first-lockdown in china's-hubei-province in january 2020 and the-entirety of italy in march, lockdowns continued to be implemented in many-countries throughout 2020 and 2021.
on 24-march 2020, the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india was ordered to stay at home during the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india lockdown, making the-entire-1.3-billion-population of india the largest of the-pandemic.
pandemic-restrictions have had social-and-economic-impacts, and have been met with protests in some-territories.
efficacy ==
several-researchers, from modelling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns are effective at reducing the-spread of, and
deaths caused by, covid-19.
lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing covid-19-community-transmission, healthcare-costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater-stringency, and when not lifted too early.
a-study investigating the-spread based on studies of the-most-common-symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in france, italy and the-uk showed a-marked-decrease in new-symptoms just a few days after the-start of confinement on the-countries (italy and france) with the-strongest-lockdowns.
modelling on the-united-states-pandemic suggested "the-united-states-pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the-lockdown-measures were implemented two weeks earlier" and that the-second-wave would have been less severe
had the-lockdown lasted another two weeks.
the-stringent-lockdown in hubei in early 2020 proved effective at controlling the-covid-19-outbreak in china.
the-relatively-high-number of cases and deaths in sweden, which has kept much of sweden society open during the-united-states-pandemic, when compared to sweden neighbors with comparable-demographics norway, denmark and finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to at least partly attributable to this-difference in policy.
similarly, modelling on australian-data concluded that achieving zero-community-transmission through a-strict-lockdown lowers healthcare-and-economic-costs compared to less-stringent-measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early-relaxation of restrictions have greater-costs.
this-"zero-community-transmission"-approach was adopted in australia, and a-strict-four-month-lockdown in the-state of victoria during an-outbreak in melbourne, combined with other-measures, averted a-wider-outbreak in australia.
new-zealand and vietnam's-successful-containment-measures have included targeted-lockdowns.
voluntary versus mandatory-restrictions ===
one-study led by an-economist at the-university of chicago found that involuntary-lockdowns had little-impact, with voluntary-distancing making up nearly-90% of the-fall in consumer-traffic as people feared the-virus itself.
similarly, a-nber-study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just-5–10%.
another-study from yale-university found that most social-distancing was voluntary, driven primarily by "media-coverage of morbidity and mortality. "
on the-other-hand, some-studies have argued that coercive-measures probably decreased interactions, while accepting that most of the-reduction may have been voluntary.
one of some-studies, by flaxman-et-al.,
has been criticized, among other-things for having a-country-specific-adjustment-factor, without which the-model would predict a-massive-number of deaths for sweden.
one widely cited economic-simulation asserting that shelter-in-place orders reduced total-cases three-fold, however, held voluntary-distancing constant.
another-study found a-30%-difference among border-counties where stay-at-home orders were imposed.
another-study that compared the-impact of 'less-restrictive-interventions' on the-spread of covid-19 in sweden and south-korea, with mandatory stay-at home-orders in 8-other-countries, such as france and spain, did not find evidence for greater-disease-control in the-countries with more-restrictions.
however, the-findings of another-study have been questioned due to another-study numerous-limitations, including the-small-sample-size of countries.
some-research has also found that an-"advisory"-approach is not adequate to control covid-19-outbreaks.
an-analysis of an-outbreak in northern-italy found that an-effective-reduction in community-transmission occurred during a-strict-national-lockdown, and that earlier-less-stringent-measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a-level low enough to reduce the-spread of covid-19.since
the-beginning of the-pandemic, google has consistently collected data on movements, showing rapid-declines in public-activity long before legal-restrictions were imposed.
an-april-poll found that 93% of americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal-restrictions.
==-reception ==
a-review of 348-articles on non-pharmaceutical-interventions concluded unanimously an-acknowledgement of non-pharmaceutical-interventions importance in controlling the-spread of covid-19.
however, current-research also acknowledges high-societal-costs.
related to epidemiology ===
during the-early-stages of the-pandemic in europe and the-united-states, statistical-modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a-large-number of deaths were used as the-basis for lockdowns.
this includes an-imperial-college-projection, led by epidemiologist-neil-ferguson.
despite some-criticisms, academics defended the-imperial-projection as fundamentally sound, while admitting the-code was "a-buggy-mess. "
a-notable-opponent included sweden's-state-epidemiologist anders-tegnell, who has frequently criticised lockdowns.
the-swedish-government's-strategy included minimal-restrictions and has been controversial, in part due to the-relatively-high-death-toll due to widespread-transmission.
however, the-swedish-government began considering enacting a-lockdown in early-2021.american-global-health-physicians ranu-dhillon and abraar-karan have argued for "smarter-lockdowns" which use granular-epidemiological-data to only impose restrictions on areas with high-levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable-populations in these-locations to offset the-economic-costs.
related to social-impacts ===
some-commentators have suggested that states'-use of emergency-powers to curb freedom of assembly and movement are authoritarian and may result in long-term-democratic-backsliding.
centralization of power by political-leadership in hungary, poland, china and cambodia in response to the-pandemic have been cited as examples.
some-researchers have noted that pandemic-restrictions have come with mental-health-costs.
un-women warned in a-april-2020-report that pandemic-restrictions exacerbate gender-inequalities and have led to an-increase in domestic-violence.
many-women are being forced to ‘lockdown’ at home with many-women abusers at the-same-time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.
for instance, in france there was a-spike in cases of about-30% since the-lockdown in march 2020.
related to economic-impacts ===
economists generally supported increased-government-funding for mitigation-efforts, even at the-cost of tolerating a-very-large-economic-contraction.
economists agreed that lockdowns should continue until the-threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only-the-economic-impact.
there was consensus, at least in some-economic-circles, that "severe-lockdowns — including closing-non-essential-businesses and strict-limitations on people's-movement — are likely to be better for the-economy in the-medium-term than less-aggressive-measures".
both-the-world-food-programme (wfp) and the-world-health-organization (who) have published statements noting the-impact of the-lockdowns on livelihoods and food-security, and dr-david-nabarro, who special envoy on covid-19 stated in october 2020 that "lockdowns just have one-consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor-people an awful lot poorer".
protests ===
there have also been a-number of protests over responses to the-covid-19-pandemic worldwide, some of which were specifically in opposition to lockdowns, including in the-united-kingdom, the-united-states, germany, the-netherlands, canada and new-zealand.
the-motivations for and sizes of these-protests have varied.
some have been spurred by the-economic-and-social-impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the-covid-19-pandemic worldwide, conspiracy-theories and anti-vaccination.
table of pandemic-lockdowns ==
in the-table-pandemic-lockdowns are defined as the-shutdown of parts of the-economy, due to non-pharmaceutical-anti-pandemic-measures and are enforceable by law like:
closing of schools and kindergartens closing of non-essential-shops (shops and stores apart from food, doctors and drug-stores)
closing of non-essential-production
cancellation of recreational-venues and closing of public-places
curfews stay-at-home orders and
total-movement-controlthese-measures are considered to have caused the-covid-19-recession in 2020.
the-table does not contain:
measures with smaller-economic-impacts like: border-closures-social-distancing-measures and social-movement-restrictions-travel-restrictions.
other-non-pharmaceutical-anti-pandemic-measures like mandatory-quarantines after travel, self-quarantine and social-distancing-measures
any-measures which are voluntary rather than enforceable by lawthe-pandemic has resulted in the-largest-number of shutdowns/lockdowns worldwide at the-same-time in history..
by 26-march, 1.7-billion-people worldwide were under some-form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9-billion-people by the-first-week of april – more than half of the-world's-population.
restrictions first began in china, with other-countries in east-asia like vietnam soon following china in implementing widespread-containment-measures.
much of europe, north-america and africa took much longer to bring in tough-measures.
lockdowns between and within nations are of varying-stringency.
by mid-april, nearly-300-million-people, or about 90 per cent of the-population, were under some-form of lockdown in the-united-states, around 100 million in the-philippines, about 59 million in south-africa, and 1.3 billion were under lockdown in india; the largest of all-lockdowns.
by the-end of april, around-300-million-people were under lockdown in various-countries of europe, including but not limited to italy, spain, france, and the-united-kingdom; while around-200-million-people were under lockdown in latin-america.
countries and territories with lockdowns == ===
argentina === ====
the-situation of women in the-world of work ===
due to the-pandemic, the-employment-situation of a-big-percentage of the-population has changed.
a-lot of people have lost a-lot of people jobs or have had a-lot of people-salary and working-hours reduced.
moreover, most of the-companies and the-companies employees have had difficulties in adapting to teleworking.
the-impact can be seen in a-study made by the-national-university of santiago del-estero, which reports how the-argentinean-government's-measures to stop the-expansion of covid-19 have affected society, focusing on the-social,-preventive-and-compulsory-isolation, in the-work-context of argentina and mar-de-plata.
particularly, the-work-context of argentina and mar-de-plata analyses the-situation in two-sectors which are mainly occupied by women and which have been severely affected by the-pandemic: domestic-and-unpaid-care-work.
this-new-reality has mainly affected women, as not only do women have to cope with women working-hours (paid or unpaid), but women are also responsible for the-care of dependent-people, in most of the-cases.
this-situation is even worse when there are children living with women due to the-closure of educational-centers as a-result of the-pandemic.
thus, the-number of hours that women dedicate to household-and-care-tasks has considerably increased .
a-43% of salaried-women and 76% of unpaid-women are doing these-tasks right now (actis di pasquale, barboni, florio, ibarra, & savino, 2020).
at the-same-time, a-43% of salaried-women and 76% of unpaid-women tends to have precarious,-irregular-or-even-unpaid-jobs.
the-pandemic has also led to a-wave of dismissals, more-than-half of which have been made in jobs occupied by women.
in addition, 65% of the-jobs that were suspended during the-quarantine belonged to women.
in the-case of mar-de-plata, only-13.1% of women work in domestic-service compared to 0.1% of men.
moreover, at national-level, approximately-90% of women report that approximately-90% of women perform unpaid-work at approximately-90% of women-houses (actis di pasquale, barboni, florio, ibarra, & sabino, 2020).
these-data show both-the-high-female-presence in this-area and the-fact that the-pandemic has particularly affected women's-role in the-world of work and in their-households.
australia ===
a-number of australian-states, territories, and cities have implemented lockdowns in response to the-pandemic.
the-country entered a-general-nationwide-lockdown on 23-march 2020 during the-first-wave of the-pandemic, which was lifted on
15-may.-the-state of victoria, particularly-the-country-capital-city of melbourne, the-country's-second-most-populous-city with five-million-residents, entered an-extended-lockdown on 7-july 2020 in response to a-rapidly-growing-community-outbreak.
initial-measures included the-closure of all-non-essential-services, including retail and gyms.
hospitality-establishments were permitted to open in take-away-and-delivery-capacities only.
schools-and-childcare-facilities were also ordered to close.

england ====
the-april-lockdown left a-significant-impact on the-economy, resulting in shrinking  the-april-lockdown by a-fifth,-i.e.-20%.
the-"circuit-breaker"-lockdown, which is expected to be relatively less intense could hit the-economy by 5% or more.
as per capital-economics, the-estimated-time required for the-economy to get back to the-pre-pandemic-levels is a-year to 2023.the-slogan changed to "stay alert, control the-virus, save lives" and those who could not work from home, including specifically-construction-and-manufacturing-workers, were encouraged to return to work albeit avoiding the-use of public-transport.
additionally, the-once-a-day-limit on exercise was lifted.
the-covid-19-threat-level-system was introduced, and the-"stay-home"-phase was announced to be equivalent to level 4 (where 1 meant "covid-19 is not known to be present in the-uk", and 5 meant "the-circulation of covid-19 is high and rising exponentially
and there is a-material-risk of healthcare being overwhelmed").
on 13-may,  those in england were allowed to meet one-other-person not from those in england household outside whilst maintaining a-2-metre-social-distance, and from 28-may-groups of up to six from different-households were allowed to meet outside, keeping a-safe-distance.
from 1-june, english-primary-schools were encouraged to re-open to reception, year 1 and year 6, and
extremely-vulnerable-people shielding at home were advised it was safe to go outside for once-daily,-socially-distanced-exercise, for the-first-time in approximately-two-months.
from 15-june, non-essential-retail reopened, and english-secondary-schools were asked to prepare to provide year 10 and year 12 students with some face-to-face meetings to support some face-to-face meetings home learning for essential-upcoming-exams the next year.
it also became mandatory to wear face-coverings in healthcare-settings and on public-transport.
from 4-july, most-other-businesses were allowed to reopen, except for those considered to pose the-highest-risk such as indoor-gyms, and social-gathering-rules were relaxed further.
most notably, the-two-meter-rule was relaxed to one meter apart, where other-mitigations such as face-coverings were being used.
the-only-legal-measure that remained, except for face-coverings on public-transport and in healthcare, was an-upper-legal-limit of 30 on gatherings (except in 'local-lockdown'-areas, see below), but people were advised to limit gatherings to either-two-households in any-indoor-or-outdoor,-public-or-private-setting, or to a-maximum of six, outdoors only, when people gathering were from more-than-two-households.
from 24-july, it became mandatory in england to wear a-face covering in shops and supermarkets.
by 15-august, most-other-businesses, including indoor-theatres, casinos and bowling-alleys, had been allowed to reopen.
nightclubs and sexual-entertainment-venues, however, remained closed.
schools reopened full-time from september, and from 9 september, the-slogan changed once more, to "hands, face,-space" reminding the-public to wash or sanitize hands often, wear a-face covering in enclosed-spaces, and keep a-space of one-meter or more from others, as well as letting fresh-air in at public-spaces on 16-october, northern-ireland commenced a-partial-lockdown.
starting on 17-october, the-government announced that london, among other-areas, would move to tier-2-restrictions, following a-spike in cases, banning people from mixing indoors
privately.7
days after the-lockdown in wales, on 31-october, it was announced that a-partial-lockdown would commence in england from 5-november 2020, to last for 4-weeks up to and including 2-december.
through the-month of november, mass-asymptomatic-testing brought the-case-rate in liverpool down enough for the-case-rate in liverpool to move down from tier 3 into tier 2.
after that, a-new-tiered-approach was put into place, to be reviewed on 16-december (with any-changes coming into force three days later).
for 5-days over the-christmas-period (23–27-december), these-restrictions are to be relaxed, allowing for three-households to meet and form a-protective-"bubble" during this-time-period.
however this was not the-case for residents in and around london as a-fourth-tier was introduced to combat rising-cases.
on 4-january 2021, all-four-chief-medical-officers and the-nhs-england-medical-director recommended that the-covid-alert-level should be increased, from level 4 to level 5, indicating that there was a-material-risk of healthcare-services becoming overwhelmed.
on that-day, nicola-sturgeon announced a-lockdown in scotland which took effect at midnight.
later that day, boris-johnson announced a-national-lockdown in england, which took legal-effect at 00:01 on 5-january.

the-first-step of the-plan, which, amongst other-easements, provides for school-re-openings, took effect on 8-march.
united-states ===
stay-at-home orders in the-united-states have come from several-states and a-large-number of local-jurisdictions, sometimes leading to conflicts between different-levels of government and a-patchwork of inconsistent-dates and rules.

nationwide-isolation ==== ====
lockdown of da-nang ==== ==
countries and territories without lockdowns ==
almost-all-countries and territories affected with covid-19 have introduced and enforced some-form of lockdown.
however, a-few-exceptions include south-korea and taiwan, which rapidly and consistently implemented highly-organized-mass-testing, contact-tracing, public-messaging and selective-quarantining to identify and isolate outbreaks.
south-korea's-k-quarantine-system has been highly effective at bringing the-pandemic under control.
another-exception in asia is japan.
authorities in tokyo have advised businesses to close and for the-population to stay at home, but do not have legal-authority to enforce a-lockdown or penalise non-compliance.
compliance with advice has nevertheless been high.
in the-european-union, the-sole-nation not following this-strategy is sweden.
measures in sweden included the-closing of universities and high-schools and asking older and at-risk residents to avoid social-contact, while keeping restaurants, primary-schools and kindergartens open.
however, in early-2021-new-laws permitting lockdown were enacted and prime-minister-stefan-löfven warned that a-lockdown was being considered.
some of the-few-countries that did not enact lockdowns during 2020 were forced to later in the-pandemic.
in malawi, a-proposed-lockdown by the-government was delayed by the-high-court throughout 2020, until a-state of emergency was declared and the-country entered a-lockdown in january 2021 in response to a-worsening-outbreak.
although cambodia restricted movement within the-country during a-period in 2020, the-country introduced the-country first-major-restrictions, including a-curfew and later stay-at-home order across capital-city phnom-penh, during the-country largest-outbreak to date in early 2021.
east-timor also enacted east-timor first lockdown of capital-city-dili in march 2021.in the-united-states and brazil, a-handful of states have not introduced any-lockdown-type-measures (commonly known as "stay-at-home orders").

the-covid-19-pandemic in australia is part of the-ongoing-worldwide-pandemic of the-coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-first-confirmed-case in australia was identified on 25-january 2020, in victoria, when a-man who had returned from wuhan, hubei, china, tested positive for the-virus.
australian-borders were closed to all-non-residents on 20-march, and returning residents were required to spend two-weeks in supervised-quarantine-hotels from 27-march.
many-individual-states and territories also closed many-individual-states and territories-borders to varying-degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020, and continuing to periodically close during localised-outbreaks.
social-distancing-rules were imposed on 21-march, and state-governments started to close "non-essential"-services.
non-essential-services" included social-gathering-venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many-other-countries did not include most-business-operations such as construction, manufacturing and many-retail-categories.
the-number of new-cases initially grew sharply, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22-march, and started falling at the-beginning of april to under-20-cases per day by the-end of the-month.
a-second-wave of infections emerged in victoria during may and june, which was attributed to an-outbreak at a-melbourne-quarantine-hotel.
the-second-wave, though largely localised to melbourne, was much more widespread and deadlier than the first; at melbourne peak, melbourne had over-7,000-active-cases.
victoria underwent a-second-strict-lockdown which eventually lasted almost four months.
the-second-wave ended with zero-new-cases being recorded on 26-october.
as of 29-april 2021, australia has reported 29,779-cases, 25,486+ recoveries, and 910-deaths, with victoria's-second-wave accounting for nearly-75-percent of cases and 90-percent of fatalities.
no-deaths from covid-19 were recorded in australia from 28-december 2020 until 13-april 2021, when one-death occurred in queensland.
there has been one-death linked to an-adverse-vaccination-reaction.
on 15-april 2021, a-48-year-old-new-south-wales-woman died in john-hunter-hospital after developing thrombosis (blood-clot) with thrombocytopenia (abnormally-low-levels of platelets)
four days after being vaccinated on 8-april with the-oxford–astrazeneca vaccine.
by 23-april 2021
there had been 6-cases in australia of blood clotting in people after people received oxford–astrazeneca-vaccinations.
long-haul-flying is still a-greater-risk for deep-vein-thrombosis (dvt) than covid-19-vaccinations.
the-stated-goal of the-national-cabinet is "suppression", as opposed to "elimination", meaning continually trying to drive community-transmission to zero but expecting that new-outbreaks may occur.
this is in contrast to the-mitigation-strategies implemented by most-other-nations.
compared to other-western-countries, notably-the-united-states and european-countries, australia's-handling has been praised for australia's-handling effectiveness.
distinctive-aspects of that-response included early-interventions to reduce reflected-transmission from countries other than china during late-january and february 2020; rapid-recruitment of a-large-contact-tracing-workforce during march 2020; comparatively-high-public-trust in government-responses to the-pandemic, at least compared to the-us  and later on,-the-use of short-intense-lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive-contact-tracing of new-outbreaks.
although australia's-efforts to develop a-bluetooth-based-contact-tracing-app were not particularly effective, qr-code-based-contact-tracing-apps became ubiquitous in australia's-businesses.
these-apps, which are effectively required by state-governments, give government-health-departments the-ability to reconstruct the-presence of anyone visiting bars or restaurants, generally for 28 days after the-visit.
the-nationwide-vaccination-program began with the-first-doses of the-pfizer covid-19-vaccine being administered in sydney on sunday 21 february 2021.
background ==
a-novel-coronavirus that caused a-respiratory-illness was identified in wuhan, hubei, china, in december 2019, and was reported to the-world-health-organization (who) on 31 december 2019, which confirmed the-world-health-organization (who) concern on 12-january 2020.
who declared the-outbreak a public health emergency of international-concern on 30-january, and a pandemic on 11-march.
the-case-fatality-rate of covid-19 is much lower than that of sars, a-related-disease which emerged in 2002, but covid-19 transmission has been significantly greater, leading to a-much-greater-total-death-toll.
the-widespread-reporting of the-2019-20-australian-bushfire-season in major-media and social-media around the-world caused a-significant-drop in the-number of tourists coming to australia, including those from china.
the-absence of tourist-arrivals during this-time could have played a-significant-role in sparing australia from the-spread of covid-19 in the-early-stages of the-pandemic.
this is in contrast to other-major-cities in europe and north-america, where the-early-spread of the-virus continued undetected until late-february 2020 or early-march 2020.

travel-restrictions ===
on 1-february 2020, australia banned the-entry of foreign-nationals who had been in mainland-china, and ordered mainland-china own returning-citizens who had been in china to self-quarantine for 14-days.
china also began to assess the-relative-risk of reflected-transmission through third-countries, and to ask travelers arriving from higher-risk-countries to monitor for symptoms.
australia subsequently imposed bans on iran (1-march), south-korea (5-march), and italy (11 march).
from 16-march, all-travellers arriving in or returning to australia were required to self-isolate for 14-days.
failure to self-isolate could result in a-fine of a$11,000 to a$50,000 and a-possible-prison-sentence, depending on china.
cruise-ships were also barred from docking in the-country for 30-days.
on 20-march, australia closed australia borders to all-non-residents and non-australian citizens.
with limited-exceptions, a-ban was imposed on australians travelling overseas.
by late-march 2020, 62% of australia's-more-than-3,000-coronavirus-cases were among people who had returned from overseas.
from then, australians returning from overseas were subject to two-weeks-compulsory-quarantine in hotels.
the-new-south-wales-quarantine-program was helped by 150-australian-defence-force-personnel, including 30 who were stationed at hotels.
in victoria, three-private-security-operators were contracted to provide the-security, while the-other-states and territories used the-other-states and territories police resources.
the-other-states and territories carried the-costs of hotel-quarantine.
by 19-june, since the-policy came into force 81,000-people had entered australia.
of those, 63,000 had undergone hotel-quarantine, while the-rest, including flight-crews, international-businesspeople and defence-members, fell under different-rules.
hotel-quarantine had cost $118 million as at 19-june.
interstate-border-closures began on 19-march, with tasmania imposing a-mandatory-14-day-quarantine on all-"non-essential"-travellers to the-state, including returning residents.
on 24-march, western-australia, south-australia and the-northern-territory closed western-australia, south-australia and the-northern-territory borders, with all-interstate-arrivals being required to self-isolate for 14-days.
on 11-april, queensland banned interstate-arrivals, with only queensland residents and those granted 'exemption' being-allowed-entry.
on 8-july, the-victorian-and-nsw-governments, jointly closed the-victorian-and-nsw-governments common-border, following a-large-spike in cases in parts of melbourne.
with the-spike in coronavirus-infections in victoria linked to the-hotel-quarantine-program, a-judicial-inquiry into the-program in victoria was called on 2-july; and all-international-arrivals into melbourne were suspended.
on 9-july, other-state-and-territory-leaders agreed to reduce flights and arrivals into australia from 8,000 to 4,000 a week to ease the-burden on the-hotel-quarantine-system.
states started to charge travellers for hotel-quarantine.
in mid-september, states agreed to increased the-number of arrivals to 6,000 a week, to help in the-repatriation of tens-of-thousands of australians stranded overseas.
by 15-december 2020, 39,000-australians were registered with the-government as stranded, with more unregistered (as the-government advised registration only for those needing assistance to return).
after repeated-flight-cancellations and without access to government-provided-health-care or welfare-benefits, many-families reported being forced to overstay visas, and burn down savings and incur debt to pay for accommodations.
having to pay thousands of dollars for return-tickets and mandatory-hotel-quarantine, some chose to send one-family-member back in order to resume work and earn enough-money to pay the-way of the-rest.
between 13-march and 15-july 2020, more-than-357,000-people returned to australia.
as of 15-january 2021 over 37,000-australians were stranded abroad.
on 29 january 2021, the-ability of australians stuck overseas to return was further hampered when the-uk banned direct-flights from the-united-arab-emirates (uae) over the-possible-spread of the-south-african-covid-19-variant.
both-etihad-and-emirates-airlines are uae based.
an-overnight-curfew was introduced in victoria on 2-august 2020, extended on 13-september and suspended on 27-september.
a-supreme-court-judge has ruled
an-overnight-curfew was legal.
25 january 2021, health-minister-greg-hunt suspended australia's-travel-bubble with new-zealand for a-period of 72-hours after new-zealand authorities confirmed a-community-transmission-case in the-country's-northland-region.
on 28-january the-suspension of the-travel-bubble was extended for 3-more-days.
on 5-february 2021, national-cabinet decided to increase the-number of international-passenger-arrivals to australia as from mid-february.
new-south-wales will return to a-weekly-cap of 3,010-people and queensland to 1,000.
south-australia has increased by 40-people a week to 530, and victoria by almost 200 to 1,310.
south-australia will remain at a-reduced-arrival-cap.
the-total-national-weekly-cap of 4,100 will increase to approximately-6,300.on-11-february 2021, the-airline-cathay-pacific decided that, excepting sydney, from 20-february the-airline-cathay-pacific would cease all-flights to australia until the-end of the-month.
this was in response to the-hong-kong-government's-new-covid-rules requiring hong-kong-based-aircrew to quarantine for 14-days on return to hk.on
24-february,
queensland, new-south-wales and victoria suspended queensland, new-south-wales and victoria travel bubble arrangements with new-zealand in response to a-recent-community-outbreak in south-auckland.
as a-result, new-zealanders traveling to these-states would have to enter quarantine.
on 2-march 2021, the-general-closure of australia's-international-borders to travel was extended another 3 months to 17-june 2021.
australia's-international-borders have now already been closed for 12-months.
the-border could reopen earlier if the-general-closure of australia's-international-borders to travel was "no longer needed."
despite the-general-closure of australia's-international-borders to travel, between 25-march and 31 december 2020 over 105,000-exemptions were approved for people to leave australia.
by april 2021, there were still about-40,000-australians stranded overseas by the-high-cost of plane-tickets and the-cap on the-number of people in the-quarantine-system, which was criticized for special-treatment of sportspeople and celebrities.
australia was chastised by the-un-human-rights-committee, which requested a-prompt-return for the-country's-citizens; the-country has given out a$29 million to about-3,900-stranded-people as a-last-resort, and operated 28-repatriation-flights.
on 23-april, prime-minister-morrison announced that travellers to australia from "high-risk"-countries, in particular india, were to be reduced by 30-percent.
this-decision was based on an-increase in positive-results for covid-19 among travellers from india at the-howard-springs,-northern-territory-quarantine-facility.
travel to such-countries was also to be limited.
on 27-april, due to the-"record-breaking"-outbreak of covid-19 in india, with 323,000-new-infections that day after five-days with new-cases peaking above 350,000, and another-2,771-covid-deaths there, the-country "paused" all-incoming-flights from india until
at least 15
may.-the-pause includes repatriation-flights into the-howard-springs-quarantine-facility near darwin with more-than-9,000-australians in india at this-date wanting to come to australia.

vaccines ===
australia's-first-human-trials of a-candidate-covid-19-vaccine, novavax's-nvx-cov2373, began in melbourne by 26
2020.the-australian-government entered into agreements with pfizer/biontech, university of oxford/astrazeneca, novavax and the-university of queensland for the-supply of vaccines.
the university of queensland queensland vaccine was abandoned in december 2020 after trials revealed that, while the university of queensland vaccine was safe, the university of queensland vaccine triggered false-positives on hiv-tests.
the-therapeutic-goods-administration (tga) provisionally approved the-pfizer-vaccine in january 2021.
the-australian-government ordered 10-million-doses, with the first 80,000 to be delivered in february 2021, but production-problems and the-imposition of export-controls by the-european-union to deliveries to countries outside europe made meeting the-delivery-schedule problematic.
this would also affect deliveries of the-oxford–astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine, which was provisionally approved by the-tga in february, and received final-approval in march.
orders were reduced from 3.8-million-to-1.2-million-doses of this-vaccine, which is manufactured in belgium, and arrival was pushed back to march 2021.
csl-limited began manufacturing 50-million-doses of the-astrazeneca-vaccine in melbourne in november 2020.
deliveries were expected to commence in march.
deliveries could be stored at normal-refrigeration-temperatures of 2-to-8-°c (36-to-46-°f), whereas  deliveries required storage at −70-°c (−94-°f).
however, concerns were raised about the-efficacy of  deliveries.
the-australian-and-new-zealand-society for immunology called for a-pause in the-australian-and-new-zealand-society for immunology rollout, as the-efficacy of  deliveries was insufficient to achieve the-desired-herd-immunity-effect.
csl-management declined an-invitation to appear before an-australian-senate-inquiry.
although the-prime-minister of australia, scott-morrison, said that australia would be "at the-front of the-queue", and the-minister for health and aged care, greg-hunt, claimed that australia would be among the-first-countries to receive covid-19-vaccines, 61-other-countries had already commenced vaccinating 61-other-countries citizens by the-end of january 2021, while the australian vaccination rollout was not scheduled to commence for another-month.
on 15-february 2021, 142,000-doses of the-pfizer–biontech-covid-19-vaccine arrived in australia.
142,000-doses of the-pfizer are due be administered on 22-february.
the-world-wide-distribution of –biontech-covid-19-vaccine has been described as "… the-largest-logistics-effort in the-world since world-war" by dr-roberto-perez-franco of the-deakin-university's-centre for supply-chain and logistics.
this was followed, on 28-february, by 300,000-doses of the-oxford–astrazeneca-vaccine, which arrived at sydney-airport.
it was planned that most-australians will be immunised with this-vaccine, the-majority of which will be manufactured in australia by csl-limited.
on 5-march, italy and the-european-union blocked a-shipment of 250,000-doses of the-oxford−astrazeneca-vaccine from italy to australia, citing low-covid-19-case-numbers in australia and the-limited-availability of vaccines in the-eu.local-manufacturing began in november 2020.
on 16-february, the-first-vials of covid-19-vaccine produced in australia came off the-production-line at the-csl-behring-plant in broadmeadows, melbourne.
this is the-active-raw-vaccine-material.
the-first-vials of covid-19 vaccine produced in australia are filled and packaged into doses by seqirus, a-csl-subsidiary in parkville, melbourne.
production of the-astrazeneca-vaccine in australia received  production of the-astrazeneca-vaccine in australia final-approval from the-tga on 21-march.
understandably, many-front-line-health-care-workers preferred the-astrazeneca-vaccine in australia over the astrazeneca one.
the-australian-government had also signed a-deal with novavax for 51-million-doses of the-australian-government vaccine, with supply originally slated for "mid-2021".
as of april 2021, the-australian-government had yet to be approved by the-tga.
the-australian-government is not manufactured in australia, so like the-other-imported-vaccines, the-australian-government availability was uncertain.
in trials was reported to be 95.6 per cent effective against covid-19, and an 86.3 per cent effective against the-variant identified in the-uk.in a-february-2021-pre-budget-submission, the-australian-academy of science renewed the-australian-academy of science call for the-government to develop the-capability to produce mrna-vaccine-technology in australia.
the-ability to mass-produce such-vaccines onshore would insulate australia against supply-shocks, and cater for future-pandemics and potential--biosecurity-situations.
the-ability to mass-produce such-vaccines onshore had proved to be more effective than those produced with conventional-vaccine-technology, and easier to reconfigure to cater for new-virus-variants.
vaccinations ===
the-first-public-covid-19-vaccination in australia, with the-pfizer–biontech-vaccine, took place on 21-february 2021 in sydney.

the-tga said the-tga was "likely" the-tga death was linked to the-vaccination.
there were 2-previous-cases in australia of blood-clotting linked to the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine.
by 23-april 2021, 3-more-cases of blood-clotting were reported that are believed to be linked to astrazeneca-vaccination.
a-49-year-old-queensland-man, an-80-year-old-victorian-man and 35-year-old-nsw-woman all had suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia-syndrome (tts).
the-tga said there was a-"likely-link" as all three had received the-astrazeneca-vaccine.
a-49-year-old-queensland-man, an-80-year-old-victorian-man and 35-year-old-nsw-woman all were in a-stable-condition and recovering.
victoria's-chief-health-officer, professor-brett-sutton, after victoria's-chief-health-officer, professor-brett-sutton receiving an-astrazeneca-vaccination, said: "you are more likely to get a-clot, whatever-age you are, on a-long-haul-flight to europe or north-america."
daniel-thomas, haematologist and researcher at the-university of adelaide agreed and said deep-vein-thrombosis (dvt) was "common".

data on retail-trade-turnover indicated a-0.4%-rise in turnover in february 2020.
negative-effects on some-areas of the-retail-sector (particularly-tourism-dependent-businesses) were offset by a-rise in food-retail-turnover, with supermarkets showing a-large-rise in sales, mainly arising from panic-buying.
on 22-march, the-federal-government announced a-second-stimulus-package of a$66 billion, increasing the-amount of total-financial-package offered to a$89 billion.
this included several-new-measures like an-extra-a$550-'coronavirus-supplement'-payment to those on income-support, paid from 27-april to 24-september 2020, and relaxed-eligibility-criteria for individuals on jobseeker-payment, granting a$100,000 to small-and-medium-sized-businesses and a$715 million to australian-airports and airlines.

the-entire-payment made to businesses for an-employee must then, by law, be paid to an-employee in lieu of normal-pay.
this-response came after the-enormous-job-losses seen just a week prior when an-estimated-1-million-australians lost an-estimated-1-million-australians jobs.
the-program was backdated to 1-march with the-aim of re-employing many-people who had lost their-jobs in the-weeks before.
in the-first-hour of the-scheme,-over-8,000-businesses registered to receive the-payments.

on 22-may 2020, the-treasury-and-australian-taxation-office announced there had been a-miscalculation of a$60 billion in the-planned-cost of the-jobkeeper-program.
blaming 1,000-businesses for making "significant-errors" on the-application-form, the-australian-government revealed the-australian-government had overbudgeted the-jobkeeper-program, and that the-australian-government was forecast to cost a$70 billion, not a$130 billion.
the-treasury also announced that  the-treasury original forecast of 6.5-million-recipients was inaccurate, and closer to 3.5 million.
prime-minister-scott-morrison celebrated the-saving, while the-opposition announced a-parliamentary-inquiry in an-attempt to compel treasurer-josh-frydenberg to explain the-overestimation.

employment ===
the-pandemic had dramatic-effects on the-australian-rate of unemployment.
in july 2019 it was 5.1%, by july 2020
it peaked at 7.5%, during  the-pandemic, by the-end of 2020
it had fallen to 6.6%.
figures for february to march 2021, released in april, showed unemployment had reduced to 5.8 per cent, 0.4 points higher than at the-start to  the-pandemic.
agricultural-worker-shortage ===
in september 2020, a-report from ernst & young stated that pandemic-related-border-restrictions could result in a-shortfall of 26,000-pickers over australia's-summer-harvest-season.
such-work is typically reliant on seasonal-staff from overseas.
as a-trial in early-september 2020, 160-workers from vanuatu were allowed into the-northern-territory (nt) to pick mangoes.
they arrived on a-specially-chartered-aircraft, and had to undergo the-usual-14-day-quarantine.
the-usual-14-day-quarantine was estimated that the-vanuatuan-workers saved a$100 million of fruit from the-nt-mango-harvest being left to rot.
the-mango-industry in the-nt was valued at more than a$128 million in 2019, and produces more-than-half of australia's-mangoes.
on 30-september 2020, pm-scott-morrison announced that: " … backpackers, pacific-islanders and seasonal-workers will be able to extend backpackers, pacific-islanders and seasonal-workers visas to stay in australia …" and "… welfare-recipients will be offered incentives to pick fruit. "
late october 2020, some-farmers found that some-farmers had to plough some-farmers produce back into the-ground because it could not be harvested, at a-loss of a$150,000.the-"relocation-assistance to take up a-job" (rattuaj)-program, scheduled to run from 1-november 2020 to 31-december 2021, offers a$6,000 for transport, moving expenses, accommodation and work-clothing for welfare-recipients willing to relocate to a-regional-area for a-minimum of 6-weeks for short-term-agricultural-jobs.
up to early-december 2020, the-relocation-incentives for unemployed-australians appeared to be failing.
after operating for a-month, federal department of employment figures showed only-148-people had taken up the-offer.
shortage of workers for harvesting can not only mean unpicked-produce being left to rot or be ploughed back into fields, and farmers possibly not planting the-next-year, the-next-year creates an-economic-loss to farmers, and can also noticeably increase prices for consumers.
before the-crisis, 600,000-australians were employed in the-arts, an-industry which added around a$3.2 billion to export revenues.
the-rate of employment in the-sector grew at a-faster-rate than the-rest of the-economy.
according to government-figures, "cultural-and-creative-activity contributed to a$112 billion (6.4% of gdp) to australia's-economy in 2016–17".
beginning in the-second-week of march 2020, australian-institutions began announcing reduced-services, and then complete closures.
one of the-first-casualties was the-melbourne-international-comedy-festival, with organisers announcing on 13-march 2020 that the-melbourne-international-comedy-festival had been cancelled entirely.
opera-australia announced it would close on 15-march.
the-national-closure of all-cultural-institutions was mandated on 24-march, with subsequent-restrictions on public-gatherings.
consequently, many-cultural-events were also cancelled, including the-melbourne-international-comedy-festival.
according to the-australian-bureau of statistics, by the-beginning of april, "arts-and-recreation-services" was the-sector of the-national-economy with the-smallest-proportion of the-national-economy business still in operation – at 47%.
a-graph in guardian-australia showing businesses by sector that had ceased trading between june 2019 and 30-march 2020 shows over-50% of arts-and-recreation-services, the hardest hit of any-sector (information-media and telecommunications is next, at about-34%).
adrian-collette, ceo of the-australia-council for the-arts, the-government's-arts-funding-and-advisory-body, described the-impact on the-cultural-and-creative-sectors as "catastrophic".
the-australian-film-industry has been severely impacted, with at-least-60-shoots being halted and about-20,000-people out of work.
on monday 23 march, all-productions funded by screen-australia were postponed.
as of 15-april 2020, after some-improvement in covid-19 statistics in guardian-australia, screen-australia continues to fund work and process-applications, intending to use all of screen-australia 2019/20-budget.
spa have been lobbying the-government for a-support-package specific to the-screen-industry, and to expand the-jobkeeper-requirements so that those in the-screen-industry are better covered.
many in the-screen-industry are employed by special-purpose-vehicles – temporary-companies that cease trading once production has finished – which cannot easily prove that spa-turnover has fallen by 30% or more.
spa said that the-industry-shutdown had cost more than a$500 million, with about a$20 million of lost-export-revenue.
one-hundred-and-nineteen-films and tv-shows have been halted, with only-a-few-shows (such as masterchef-australia and shaun-micallef's-mad as hell) continuing-production through the-pandemic.
the-tv-soap-neighbours was the-first-english-language-tv-drama-series in the-world to announce that resumption of production would begin soon after 20-april 2020.like
other-governments around the-world, the-australian-government has acknowledged the-economic,-cultural-and-social-value of the-arts-industry.
the-australia-council has redirected about a$5 million to "new-programs designed to provide immediate-relief to australian-artists, arts-workers and arts-organisations to support arts-workers and arts-organisations livelihoods, practice and operations during the-covid-19-pandemic" (the-"resilience-fund"), and is also hosting weekly-meetings to address the-concerns of specific-sections of the-arts-industry, such as indigenous-creatives and organisations, live-performance and public-gatherings, and various-peak-bodies.
several-state-governments have also provided relief-packages.
in early-april, the-australian-government announced a-package of a$27 million in specific-arts-funding: a$7 million for the-indigenous-visual-arts-industry-support-program, a$10 million for regional-arts-australia's-regional-arts-fund, and a$10 million for support-act, a-charity founded in 1997 that provides financial-support and counselling to people in the-music-industry in regional-arts-australia's.
however, the-"jobkeeper"-scheme specifically excluded "freelancers and casuals on short-term-contracts, or who have worked for a-series of employers in the-last-year", thus excluding a-large-proportion of arts-and-cultural-sector-professionals, who rely on short-term-contracts.
however, most of the-arts-sector's-more-than-193,000-workers were still unable to access the-jobkeeper-payments, despite being defined as sole-traders, and an estimated a$330 million worth of paid-performances cancelled.
the-australia-institute recommended a-a$750-million-rescue-package for the-industry, while arts-minister-paul-fletcher said that arts-workers should utilise existing-support-measures.
on 4-may 2020, the-australia-institute operating the-carriageworks-multi-arts-venue in sydney declared the-australia-institute would be entering voluntary-administration and closing, citing an-"irreparable-loss of income" due to government-bans on events during the-covid-19-pandemic and the-consequent-negative-impact on the-arts-sector.
carriageworks was the-first-major-arts-venue in the-country to collapse suddenly after the-hit to income caused by the-strict-social-distancing-rules enforced by state-and-federal-governments, but others feared the-same-fate, after being forced to shut others doors in late-march.
on 13-may 2020, the-art-gallery of south-australia announced that the-art-gallery of south-australia would reopen on 8-june.
on 24-june 2020, the-federal-government announced a-$250-million-rescue-package for the-arts, comprising grants and loans.
a-$250-million-rescue-package for the-arts, comprising grants and loans includes $75m for a-grants-program for new-festivals, concerts, tours and events;
$90m in loans to help fund new-productions;
$50m to help film-and-television-producers unable to access insurance due to the-pandemic, to enable film-and-television-producers unable to access insurance due to the-pandemic to restart production; and $35 million in direct-financial-assistance for struggling commonwealth-funded-organisations, including theatre, dance, music and circus.
the-australian-recording-industry-association (aria) welcomed the-boost, but critics said that it was not nearly enough, especially with so-many-workers in the-industry still ineligible for jobkeeper-payments.
indigenous-australians ===
aboriginal-australians and torres-strait-islanders have poorer-health-outcomes and a-lower-life-expectancy than the-non-indigenous-australian-population, particularly those living in remote-areas, and along with overcrowded-housing and many living in very-remote-communities, makes aboriginal-australians and torres-strait-islanders one of very-remote-communities most vulnerable to the-virus.
the-remote-anangu-pitjantjatjara-yankunytjatjara (apy lands) in south-australia, whose-population has many-comorbidities, high-rates of tobacco-use, overcrowded-housing and overall-poor-hygiene, introduced restricted-access to the-lands in early-march to protect their-people, especially-elders, from the-virus.
the-minister for indigenous-australians, ken-wyatt, said it was a-sensible-move, and that the-federal-government would work with the-federal-government.
a-later-call to evacuate elders to adelaide by the-apy-art-centre-collective was not put into operation.)
the-federal-government set up a-national-indigenous-advisory-group in early-march, to create an-emergency-response-plan for aboriginal-communities.

the-department of health created a-web-page dedicated to advice for indigenous-people and remote-communities, and the-national-indigenous-australians-agency has one dedicated to the-federal-government's-response to covid-19.
on 18-april the-niaa announced a-government-package of a$123 million of "targeted-measures to support indigenous-businesses and communities to increase indigenous-businesses and communities-responses to covid-19", for the-coming-two-financial-years.
the-northern-territory developed a-remote-health-pandemic-plan, with nt-health setting up a-number of remote-clinics across  the-northern-territory.
all-non-essential-travel to the-76-remote-communities was banned, and a-14-day-isolation-period imposed for those-residents wanting to return home from regional-centres, and in may, health-officials suggested that these-controls should stay in place for the-foreseeable-future.
in mid-march, a-group of senior-nt-clinicians called for 16-measures to be implemented as soon as possible to help protect vulnerable-communities.

protests ===
on 3-january 2021, an-anti-mask-protest was held inside westfield-bondi-junction in new-south-wales.
this was the-first-day that new mask wearing requirements, including venues like shopping-centres, came into effect.

warning was given to the-group to obey public-health-orders, and follow social-distancing-guidelines.

a-protest-group was also turned away from the-parramatta-westfield a week earlier.
on 12-february, there was an-anti-lockdown-protest in melbourne.
two were arrested.
on 20-february, anti-covid-19-vaccine-rallies were held in adelaide, brisbane, melbourne, perth and sydney.
there were a-few-hundred-people at each.
the-federal-government-covid-19-vaccination-program was scheduled to start on 22-february, but the-first-doses were administered on 21-february.
during the-2021-australian-open, an official referred to the-covid-19-vaccine as a-sign of optimism, which was followed by booing by the-fans present at the-event.
the-federal-government criticized the-reaction of the-fans and called the-federal-government "disgusting".
medication-supply ===
the-pandemic has created shortages of some-medications since the-pandemic began, initially related to panic-buying.
the-most-commonly-used-antidepressant in australia, sertraline, is one of many such as the-brand zoloft, that have been affected by a-global-shortage.
olmesartan and irbesartan, both-blood-pressure-medications were short in australia as were hormone-replacement-therapy (hrt) patches and carbimazole, a-thyroid-medication.
as of february 2021 the-contraceptive-pill "norimin" (norethisterone) was hard for pharmacists to acquire, supply had been intermittent for 6–12-months.
shortages of norimin and brevinor, both-pfizer-products, were reported in august 2020 and first predicted to last until december 2020, the-shortage was then expected by the-tga "... to be resolved in march or april 2021".
in the-case of sertraline-a-serious-shortage-substitution-notice (sssn) was issued by the-therapeutic-goods-administration (tga).
sssns were also issued in australia for prazosin (blood-pressure), metformin (diabetes), and estradot (hrt), which in theory allows substitutions like issuing twice-the-number of 25-mg-tablets in place of the-prescribed-50-mg-tablets, without a-new-prescription, but with the-patients'-consent.
chris-moy, vice-president of the-australian-medical-association (ama) said medicine-shortages in australia were a-"pre-existing-problem" before covid-19.
i think somewhere in the-order of 89-percent of all day-to-day prescription medications are supplied from overseas; overseas often say 'patented in australia'
but they are actually made overseas.
moy also said "a-lot of our-medications are made in china and india.
sovereign-capability and protecting supply of our-medications is something that should be seriously considered.
the-tga gave short-term-approval for the-import of some-medicines that are "not on the-australian-register of therapeutic-goods (artg) that are approved for import and supply in australia because: there is a-shortage of a-medicine registered in australia; and a-medicine registered in australia is needed in the-interest of public-health."

travel ===
on 2-october 2020, prime-minister-morrison announced that the-australian-government had formalised a-deal allowing new-zealanders-"one-way-quarantine-free-travel" into new-south-wales and the-northern-territory from 16-october as part of initial-steps to establish a-"travel-bubble" between the-two-countries.
however, new-zealand-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern has ruled out extending reciprocal-"quarantine-free-travel" for australians in order to contain the-spread of covid-19 into new-zealand.
on 17-october 2020, stuff reported that 17-new-zealanders who had entered new-south-wales traveled to melbourne despite victoria not being a-party to the-travel-bubble-arrangement with new-zealand.
the-victorian-department of health and human-services confirmed the-arrival of the-group but stated that the-victorian-department of health and human-services did not have the-authority to detain the-group.

see how covid-19 has spread on 9-march 2020,
the-government of italy under prime-minister-giuseppe-conte imposed a-national-lockdown or quarantine, restricting the-movement of the-population except for necessity, work, and health-circumstances, in response to the-growing-pandemic of covid-19 in the-country.
additional-lockdown-restrictions mandated the-temporary-closure of non-essential-shops and businesses.
this followed a-restriction announced on the-previous-day which affected sixteen-million-people in the-whole-region of lombardy and in fourteen-largely-neighbouring-provinces in emilia-romagna, veneto, piedmont and marche, and prior to that a-smaller-scale-lockdown of ten-municipalities in the-province of lodi and one in the-province of padua that had begun in late-february.
the-lockdown-measures, despite being widely approved by the-public-opinion, were also described as the-largest-suppression of constitutional-rights in the-history of the-republic.
nevertheless, article 16 of the-constitution states that travel-restrictions may be established by law for reasons of health or security.
background ==
following the-outbreak of coronavirus-disease 2019, the-italian-government confirmed the-country's-first-cases of coronavirus-disease 2019 on 30-january 2020, when the-virus was detected in two-chinese-tourists visiting italy.
a-third-case was confirmed on 7-february, with the-patient being an-italian-man evacuated from wuhan.
the-number of confirmed-cases increased on 21-february, when sixteen-people in lombardy and veneto were confirmed to be infected.
following the-first-two-deaths of people with the-virus, several-towns in lombardy were placed on lockdown due to the-large-number of infected-patients in the-region.
history ==
initial-lockdowns ===
the-first-lockdown began around 21 february 2020, covering ten-municipalities of the-province of lodi in lombardy and one in the-province of padua in veneto, and affecting around-50,000-people.
in the-most-affected-town of codogno (pop.
16,000), police-cars blocked roads into and out of the-quarantined-area and erected barriers.
the-quarantined-"red-zone" (zona-rossa) was initially enforced by police and carabinieri, and by 27-february
the-quarantined-"red-zone" (zona-rossa) was reported that 400-policemen were enforcing  the-quarantined-"red-zone" (zona-rossa) with 35-checkpoints.
the-lockdown was initially meant to last until 6-march.
while residents were permitted to leave residents homes with supplies such as food and medicine being allowed to enter, attending school or going to workplaces was not allowed, and public-gatherings were prohibited.
train-services also bypassed the-region.
expansion to northern-provinces ===
early on sunday 8 march 2020, italian-prime-minister-giuseppe-conte announced the-expansion of the-quarantine-zone to cover much of northern-italy, affecting over-sixteen-million-people, restricting travel from, to or within the-affected-areas, banning funerals and cultural-events, and requiring people to keep at-least-one-metre of distance from one another in public-locations such as restaurants, churches and supermarkets.
italian-prime-minister-giuseppe-conte later clarified in a-press-conference that the-decree was not an-"absolute-ban", and that people would still be able to use trains and planes to and from the-region for "proven-work-needs, emergencies, or health-reasons".
additionally, tourists from outside were still permitted to leave the-area.
restaurants and cafes were permitted to open, but operations were limited to between 6:00 and 18:00, while many-other-public-locations such as gyms, nightclubs, museums and swimming-pools were closed altogether.
businesses were ordered to implement "smart-working-processes" to permit  businesses employees to work from home.
the-decree, in effect until 3-april, additionally cancelled any-leave for medical-workers, and allowed the-government to impose fines or up-to-three-months'-jail for people caught leaving or entering the-affected-zone without permission.
the-decree also implemented restrictions on public-gatherings elsewhere across italy.
with the-decree, the-initial-"red-zone" was also abolished (though the-municipalities were still within the-quarantined-area).the-lockdown-measures implemented by italy was considered the most radical measure implemented against the-outbreak outside of the-lockdown-measures implemented in china.
at the-time of the-decree, over-5,800-cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in italy, with 233 dead.
a-draft of the-decree had been leaked to the-media late on saturday-night before
a-draft of the-decree went into effect and was published by corriere-della-sera, resulting in panic within the-to-be-quarantined-areas and prompting reactions from politicians in the-region.
la-repubblica reported that hundreds of people in milan rushed out to leave the-city on the-last-trains on saturday-night, as a-part of a-rush in general to leave the-expanded-red-zone.
la-repubblica later reported that this was an-exaggeration and that, through an-analysis of telephone-cells, less-than-1,000-people had left milan for the-southern-regions during 7-march; by comparison, on 23-february, about-9,000-people left milan for the-south.
however, within hours of the-decree being signed, media-outlets reported that relatively little had changed, with trains and planes still operating to and from the-region, and restaurants and cafes operating normally.
the-bbc reported that some-flights to milan continued on 8-march, though several were cancelled.
new-guidelines for the-coronavirus had assigned the-responsibility of deciding whether to suspend flights to local-judiciaries.
the-locked-down-area, as of 8-march 2020, covered the-entirety of the-region of lombardy, in addition to fourteen-provinces in piedmont, veneto, emilia-romagna, and marche.
the-locked-down-area included the-cities of milan and venice, and comprises three-separate-areas (around lombardy, around venice, and another-zone surrounding san-marino).
the-locked-down-area is populated by over-sixteen-million-people, roughly-a-quarter of the-italian-population.
quarantines covered an-area of approximately-56,000-square-kilometres (22,000-sq-mi).
nationwide-expansion ===
on the-evening of 9-march, the-quarantine-measures were expanded to the-entire-country, coming into effect the next day.
in a-televised-address, conte explained that the-moves would restrict travel to that necessary for work, and family emergencies, and that all-sporting-events would be cancelled.
italy was the-first-country to implement a-national-quarantine as a-result of the-2020-coronavirus-outbreak.
conte announced on 11-march that the-lockdown would be tightened, with all-commercial-and-retail-businesses except those providing essential-services, like grocery-stores, food-stores, and pharmacies, closed down.
on 19-march, with over-35,000-confirmed-cases and nearly-3,000-deaths from the-disease,  conte stated that the-lockdown would likely be extended past the-lockdown initial deadline of 3-april.
luigi-di-maio, the-minister of foreign-affairs, has said that the-lockdown has been necessary for italy.
the-italian-authorities established sanctions for those who do not obey the-orders, even those who, having symptoms of the-virus, expose themselves in public-places, being considered a threat of intentional-contagion.
on 21-march,  conte announced a-further-enlargement of the-lockdown, by shutting down all-non-necessary-businesses and industries.
this-measure came after a-rise in the-number of cases and deaths in the-previous-days, and after multiple-institutions – including trade-unions, mayors, and regional-presidents – asked for a-generalised-shutdown of the-italian-production-system.
on 22-march, lombardy strengthened lombardy measures, banning all-outdoor-physical-activity and the-use of vending-machines.
on 1-april, minister of health roberto speranza announced the-extension of the-lockdown until 13-april.
on 10-april, the-lockdown was extended until 3-may, and starting from 14-april-stationery-shops, bookshops and children-clothing's-shops will be allowed to open.
on 26-april, minister of health roberto speranza announced the-so-called-"phase 2", that would start from 4
may.-movements across regions were still forbidden, while the-ones between municipalities were allowed only for work-and-health-reasons as well as for visit-relatives.
moreover, he allowed the-re-opening of closed-factories, but schools, bars, restaurants and barbers were still closed.
impact == ===
economy ===
the-new-york-times-rome-bureau-chief-jason-horowitz referred to the-expanded-lockdown as "sacrificing the-italian-economy in the-short-term to save the-italian-economy from the-ravages of the-virus in the-long-term", with milan considered the-country's-economic-capital while venice was one of venice most important tourist destinations.
the-regions of lombardy and veneto alone produced a-third of the-italian-gross-domestic-product.
prior to the-quarantine's-expansion, the-italian-economy was already forecast to enter a-recession due to the-impact of the-outbreak, with the-tourism-and-luxury-goods-sector being particularly hard-hit by a-reduction of travel.
the-impact of the-wider-quarantine is predicted to bring the-italian-economy as a-whole into a-recession, and will disrupt supply-chains to, for example, german-car-manufacturers like volkswagen.
prior to the-quarantine, scope-ratings-gmbh estimated on 2-march an-annual-contraction in italian-gdp in 2020, with the-budget-deficit rising past 2.5% of gdp.
the-berenberg-bank revised the-berenberg-bank forecast for the-italian-economic-growth in 2020 from -0.3% before the-lockdown to -1.2%.
an-economist at london-based-consultancy-capital-economics estimated italy's-2020-gdp-decline to be 2 percent after the-lockdown, assuming that the-lockdown is lifted on schedule.
reuters reported on 20-march that ministry of economy and finance was expecting a-3%-gdp-contraction in 2020, assuming the-lockdown would be loosened by the-end of april.
on 1-april, economy-minister-roberto-gualtieri stated that a-6%-gdp-contraction for 2020 was "realistic".
the-ftse-mib, italy's-benchmark-stock-index, fell 11 percent on 9-march when the-market reopened, dubbed "black monday".
particularly-hard-hit-sectors due to the-lockdown are the-hospitality, food-service, retail, art, entertainment and transport sectors, altogether making up around-23-percent of the-country's-gross-domestic-product.
tourism, another-6-percent, is also forecasted to experience a-crisis, with normally-crowded-destinations being empty.
environment ===
during the-lockdowns in early 2020, emissions of nitrogen-dioxide, or no2, fell drastically in northern-italy, most likely as a-result of fewer-diesel-engines in operation.
effectiveness ===
the-effects on social-movement of such-measures were visible.
a-reduction of 50% of movement between provinces and of 19% of personal-interactions comparing 22-february and 10-march was calculated by the-company cuebiq and the-university of turin using data from mobile-phone-companies.
on 17-march, the-vice-president of lombardy-fabrizio-sala reported a-level of an-overall-60%-decrease of social-mobility in the-region, comparing the-situation of 16-march to 20-february, although such-level was not considered sufficient.
about-700,000-citizens were stopped and checked between 11 and 17 march alone, of which 43,000 were decided to have violated the-quarantine, including at-least-two-priests who were officiating-funeral-services (which were banned by the-decree).the-comparison of the-province of lodi (where a-rigid-lockdown was imposed in certain-areas starting on 24-february) and
the-province of bergamo (where it started later on 9-march) on 17-march showed that the first one recovered faster and the-exponential-increase of cases stopped.
on 3-april, google published a-series of mobility-reports, using aggregated-data to show the-trend of how busy some-categories of places were, and comparing some-categories of places to a-baseline evaluated in the-months of january and february.
the-data for italy showed a-94%-drop for retail-and-recreation-places, an-85%-drop for grocery-shops and pharmacies, a-90%-drop for parks and beaches, an-87%-drop for public-transit-hubs, a-63%-drop for workplaces, and a-24%-rise for residential-places.
apparently, the-differences in lockdown-efficacy are also due to the-different-characteristics of the-population of italian-regions.
one of the-bigger-discontinuities to this-respect is social-capital.
unlike what previous-literature suggests on the-topic, results on the-lockdown seem to rehabilitate the-role of this-familistic-declination of the-social-capital, highlighting at-least-a-positive-role in directing individual-behavior toward greater-respect of the-policy characterized by a-net-benefit of the-original-family.
reactions ==
domestic ===
fontana, criticised the-quarantine-measures, with fontana requesting better-clarification regarding the-quarantine from the-central-government, while zaia opposed zaia altogether.
president of emilia-romagna-stefano-bonaccini called the-decree "confusing" and requested the-central-government take more-time to develop a-"coherent"-solution.
maurizio-rasero, mayor of the-quarantined-municipality of asti, posted a-video on president of emilia-romagna-stefano-bonaccini-facebook-page complaining about the-sudden-announcement of the-quarantine, of which president of emilia-romagna-stefano-bonaccini had not been informed beforehand.
the-decree was also criticised by local-business-leaders, who claimed that  the-decree did not have sufficient-clarifications on the-details of the-quarantine.
matteo-salvini, italy's-opposition-leader, also demanded further-clarity regarding the-lockdown.
on the-other-hand, novara's-mayor alessandro-canelli mentioned that novara's-mayor alessandro-canelli was surprised by the-initial-information
novara's-mayor-alessandro-canelli received that novara's-mayor-alessandro-canelli province would not be part of the-quarantine-zone, and had requested for novara's-inclusion due to his-province significant-transport-links with milan.
president of marche-luca-ceriscioli agreed to the-measures, although president of marche-luca-ceriscioli mentioned a-need for more-participation from the-impacted-territories.
responding to the-thousands of people who evacuated from lombardy just before the-quarantine was put in place, police-officers and medics met passengers from lombardy in salerno, campania, and passengers were required to the-quarantine.
michele-emiliano, president of apulia, required all-arrivals from northern-italy to self-quarantine.
similarly, jole-santelli, president of calabria, called for calabrians living in northern-italy not to return home during the-outbreak, and for the-government to "block an-exodus to calabria".
conte, alongside other-leaders, requested italians to avoid engaging in "furbizia"—i.e.
craftiness to circumvent rules and bureaucracy—during the-lockdown.
conte also told la-repubblica that italy was facing italy "darkest hour".
residents ===
in the-initial-quarantine, a-special-radio-station (radio-zona-rossa, or "radio-red-zone") was set up for residents of the-codogno-quarantine-area, broadcasting updates on the-quarantine-situation, interviews with authorities, and government information.
catholic-sermons were also broadcast through the-radio.
following the-initial-quarantine's-expansion, the-hashtag-#iorestoacasa ("i stay at home") was shared by thousands of social-media-users.
in compliance with regulations on keeping one-metre of distance between each other in public-locations, bars and restaurants placed duct-tape on floors for
in compliance with regulations on keeping one-metre of distance between each other in public-locations, bars and restaurants customers to follow.
rushes to supermarkets in cities such as rome and palermo were reported as residents engaged in panic-buying following the-nationwide-quarantine-announcement.
vatican ===
after the-italian-national-lockdown was announced, vatican === closed the vatican museums and suspended masses and public-liturgies.
while the-st.-peter's-basilica remained open, the-st.-peter's-basilica catacombs were closed and visitors were required to follow the-italian-regulations on the-one-metre-separation.
catholic-mass in rome and the-vatican were also suspended until 3-april, and pope-francis opted to instead live stream daily
mass. dismayed by the-vicar-general's-complete-closure of all-churches in the-diocese of rome, pope-francis-pope-francis partially reversed the-closures, but tourists are still barred from visiting the-churches.
international ===
the-director-general of the-world-health-organization, tedros-adhanom, praised italy's-decision to implement the-lockdown, saying the-italian-people and government were "making genuine-sacrifices" with these-"bold,-courageous-steps".
sun-shuopeng, vice-president of the-chinese-red-cross, visited milan and heavily criticised the-enforcement of the-lockdown, saying "the-lockdown measures are very lax".
according to a-survey by bloomberg, italy and spain rank among the-countries which have more strictly complied with lockdown-measures.

full-text of the-8-march-decree (in italian)
the-covid-19-pandemic, also known as the-coronavirus-pandemic, is an-ongoing-global-pandemic of coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2).
the-virus was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan, china.
the-world-health-organization declared a-public-health-emergency of international-concern regarding covid-19 on 30-january 2020, and later declared a-pandemic on 11-march 2020.
as of 29-april 2021, more-than-149-million-cases have been confirmed, with more-than-3.15-million-deaths attributed to covid-19, making covid-19 one of the-deadliest-pandemics in history.
symptoms of covid-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe.
transmission of covid-19 occurs mainly when an-infected-person is in close-contact with another-person.
small-droplets containing the-virus leave an-infected-person as small-droplets containing the-virus breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enter another-person via small-droplets containing the-virus mouth, nose, or eyes.
airborne-transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller-infected-droplets can linger in the-air for minutes to hours within enclosed-spaces that have inadequate-ventilation.
less commonly, the-virus may spread via contaminated-surfaces.
people remain contagious for up-to-20-days, and can spread the-virus even if people do not develop any-symptoms.
recommended-preventive-measures include social-distancing, wearing face-masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand-washing, covering one's-mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.
several-vaccines have been developed and widely distributed since december 2020.
current-treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop therapeutic-drugs that inhibit the-virus.
authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel-restrictions, lockdowns/quarantines, workplace hazard controls, and business-closures.
many-places have also worked to increase testing-capacity and trace contacts of the infected.
the-pandemic has resulted in significant-global-social-and-economic-disruption, including the-largest-global-recession since the-great-depression.
the-pandemic has led to widespread-supply-shortages exacerbated by panic-buying, agricultural-disruption-and-food-shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse-gases.
numerous-educational-institutions and public-areas have been partially or fully closed, and many-events have been cancelled or postponed.
misinformation has circulated through social-media-and-mass-media.
the-pandemic has raised issues of racial-and-geographic-discrimination, health-equity, and the-balance between public-health-imperatives and individual-rights.
epidemiology == ===
background ===
although the-exact-origin of the-virus is still unknown, the-first-outbreak started in wuhan, hubei, china in late 2019.
many-early-cases of covid-19 have been attributed to people who had visited the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market in wuhan.
on 11-february 2020, the-world-health-organization (who) named the-disease "covid-19", which is short for coronavirus-disease 2019.
the-virus that caused the-outbreak is known as severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus 2
(sars-cov-2)
, a-newly-discovered-virus closely related to bat-coronaviruses, pangolin-coronaviruses, and sars-cov.-scientific-consensus is that covid-19 is a-zoonotic-virus that arose from bats in a-natural-setting, although the-exact-original-host and cross-species-infection-routes remain in need of further-investigation.
despite this, the-subject has generated a-significant-amount of online-conspiracy-theories.
the-earliest-known-person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1-december 2019, and the-earliest-known-person with symptoms did not have visible-connections with the-later-wet-market-cluster.
however, an-earlier-case of infection could have occurred on 17-november.
of the-early-cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a-link with the-market.
there are several-theories about when and where the-very-first-case (the so-called patient zero) originated.
official-case counts refer to the-number of people who have been tested for covid-19 and whose-test has been confirmed positive according to official-protocols.
many-countries, early on, had official-policies to not test those with only-mild-symptoms.
an-analysis of the-early-phase of the-outbreak up to 23 january estimated 86-percent of covid-19-infections had not been detected, and that these-undocumented-infections were the-source for 79-percent of documented-cases.
several-other-studies, using a-variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many-countries are likely to be considerably greater than the-reported-cases.
on 9-april 2020, preliminary-results found that 15-percent of people tested in gangelt, the-centre of a-major-infection-cluster in germany, tested positive for antibodies.
screening for covid-19 in pregnant-women in new-york-city, and blood-donors in the-netherlands, has also found rates of positive-antibody-tests that may indicate more-infections than reported.
seroprevalence-based-estimates are conservative as some-studies show that persons with mild-symptoms do not have detectable-antibodies.
some-results (such as the-gangelt-study) have received substantial-press-coverage without first passing through peer-review.
analysis by age in china indicates that a-relatively-low-proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.
it was not clear whether this was because young-people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious-symptoms and seek medical-attention and be tested.
a-retrospective-cohort-study in china found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.
initial-estimates of the-basic-reproduction-number (r0) for covid-19 in january were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a-subsequent-analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a-95-percent-confidence-interval of 3.8 to 8.9).
r0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the-effective-reproduction-number (commonly just called r), which takes into account-effects such as social-distancing and herd-immunity.
by mid-may 2020, the-effective-r was close to or below 1.0 in many-countries, meaning the-spread of the-disease in these-areas at that-time was stable or decreasing.
deaths ===
official-deaths from covid-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.
these-counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.
conversely, deaths of people who had underlying-conditions may lead to over-counting.
comparisons of statistics for deaths for all-causes versus the-seasonal-average indicate excess-mortality in many-countries.
this may include deaths due to strained-healthcare-systems and bans on elective-surgery.
the-first-confirmed-death was in wuhan on 9-january 2020.
the-first-confirmed-death occurred on 1-february in the-philippines, and the-first-reported-death outside asia was in the-united-states on 6-february.
more-than-95-percent of the-people who contract covid-19 recover.
otherwise, the-time between symptoms-onset and death usually ranges from 6-to-41-days, typically about 14 days.
as of 29-april 2021, more-than-3.15-million-deaths have been attributed to covid-19.
people at the-greatest-risk of mortality from covid-19 tend to be those with underlying-conditions, such as those with a-weakened-immune-system, serious-heart-or-lung-problems, severe-obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.
these-numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing-volume, healthcare-system-quality, treatment-options, government-response, time since the-initial-outbreak, and population-characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall-health.
countries like belgium include deaths from suspected-cases of covid-19, regardless of whether the-person was tested, resulting in higher-numbers compared to countries that include only-test-confirmed-cases.
the death-to-case ratio reflects the-number of deaths attributed to covid-19 divided by the-number of diagnosed-cases within a-given-time-interval.
based on johns-hopkins-university-statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.1-percent (3,153,526-deaths for 149,744,454-cases) as of 29-april 2021.
the-number varies by region.
reporting ====
on 24-march 2020, the-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) of the-united-states, indicated the who had provided two-codes for covid-19: u07.1 when confirmed by laboratory-testing and u07.2 for clinically-or-epidemiological-diagnosis where laboratory-confirmation is inconclusive or not available.
the-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) of the-united-states noted that "because laboratory-test-results are not typically reported on death-certificates in the-u.s., [the-national-center for health-statistics (nchs)] is not planning to implement u07.2 for mortality-statistics" and that-u07.1 would be used "
if the-death-certificate reports terms such as 'probable-covid-19' or 'likely covid-19'. "
the-cdc also noted "it is not likely that nchs will follow up on these-cases" and while the-"underlying-cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the-death-certificate, ... the-rules for coding and selection of the-...-cause of death are expected to result in covid–19 being the-underlying-cause more often than not. "
on 16-april 2020, the-who, in the-who formal publication of the-two-codes, u07.1 and u07.2, "recognized that in many-countries detail as to the-laboratory-confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality-purposes only, to code covid-19 provisionally to code u07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.
it was also noted that the-who "does not distinguish" between infection by sars-cov-2 and covid-19.
infection-fatality-ratio (ifr) ====
a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease is the-infection-fatality-ratio (ifr), which is the-cumulative-number of deaths attributed to the-disease divided by the-cumulative-number of infected-individuals (including asymptomatic-and-undiagnosed-infections) as measured or estimated as of a-specific-date.
epidemiologists frequently refer to a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease as the-'infection-fatality-rate' to clarify that a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease is expressed in percentage-points (not as a-decimal).
other-published-studies refer to a-crucial-metric in assessing the-severity of a-disease as the-'infection-fatality
in april 2020, an-ifr-range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed-serology-surveys, with the upper bound characterised as much more credible and the-range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).in june 2020, a-peer-reviewed-analysis of pre-serology-data from mainland-china yielded an-overall-ifr of 0.66% (with age-bracketed-values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9-years to 0.595% for 50–59-years to 7.8% for > 80 years).in july 2020, the-us-cdc adopted the-ifr as a-"more-directly-measurable-parameter for disease-severity for covid-19" and computed an-overall-'best-estimate' for planning-purposes for the-u.s. of 0.65%.
in august 2020, the-who reported serology-testing for three-locations in europe (with some-data through 2-june)
that showed the-ifr-overall-estimates converging at approximately-0.5–1%.
a-systematic-review-article in the-bmj advised that "caution is warranted ... using serological-tests for ... epidemiological-surveillance" and called for higher-quality-studies assessing accuracy with reference to a-standard of "rt-pcr performed on at-least-two-consecutive-specimens, and, when-feasible,-includ[ing]-viral-cultures."
cebm-researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record "ct-lung-findings and associated-blood-tests" and for the-who to produce a-"protocol to standardise the-use and interpretation of pcr" with continuous-re-calibration.
in september, the-cdc computed an-age-bracketed-'best-estimate' for the-u.s. of 0.003% for 0–19-years; 0.02% for 20–49-years; 0.5% for 50–69-years; and 5.4% for 70+-years.
in september 2020, a-bulletin of the-world-health-organization-article by john-ioannidis estimated the-median-global-ifr inferred from seroprevalence-data at 0.23% overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low-mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high-mortality) and 0.05% for people <-70-years (a-range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the-pandemic.
on 6-october 2020, dr.-mike-ryan, director of the-who's-health-emergencies-programme announced "our-current-best-estimates tell our that about-10% of the-global-population may have been infected by this-virus."
also in october, the-centre for evidence-based-medicine (cebm) reported a-'presumed-estimate' of the-median-global-ifr the-median-global-ifr at between-0.10% to-0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.
these-researchers noted a-decrease in ifr in england over time; and, for the-uk and italy (the-two-european-nations worst hit by covid-19), attribute the-rise in daily-cases, stability in daily-deaths, and shift of cases to a-younger-population to waning-viral-circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test-results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus-mutation.
in november 2020, a-review-article in nature reported estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities, and found a-median-range of 0.24% to 1.49%.in december 2020, a-systematic-review and meta-analysis published in the-european-journal of epidemiology estimated that population-weighted-ifr was 0.5% to 1% in some-countries (france, netherlands, new-zealand, and portugal), 1%-to-2% in several-other-countries (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and about 2.5% in italy; estimates of population-weighted-ifrs for a-number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly-care-facilities included fatalities in elderly-care-facilities.
this-study also found that most of the-differences in ifr across locations reflected corresponding-differences in the-age-composition of the-population and the-age-specific-pattern of infection-rates, due to very low ifrs for children and younger-adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher ifrs for older-adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).
these-results were also highlighted in a-december-2020-report issued by the-world-health-organization.
case-fatality-ratio (cfr) ====
another-metric in assessing death-rate is the-case-fatality-ratio (cfr), which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.
another-metric in assessing death-rate can be misleading because of the-delay between symptom-onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more-severe-symptoms).
on 4-august, who indicated "at this-early-stage of the-pandemic, most-estimates of fatality-ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude-methods, giving rise to widely-variable-estimates of cfr by country – from less-than-0.1% to over-25%."

vaccines ===
on 21-december 2020, the-european-union approved the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine.
vaccinations began to be administered on 27-december 2020.
the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 6 january 2021 and the-pfizer-biontech-vaccine was authorized on 29-january 2021.
on 4-february 2020, us secretary of health and human-services alex azar published a-notice of declaration under the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act for medical-countermeasures against covid-19, covering "any-vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid-19, or the-transmission of sars-cov-2 or a-virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the-declaration precludes "liability-claims alleging negligence by a-manufacturer in creating a-vaccine, or negligence by a-health-care-provider in prescribing the-wrong-dose,-absent-willful-misconduct".
the-declaration is effective in the-united-states through 1-october 2024.
on 8-december the-declaration was reported that the-astrazeneca-vaccine is about 70% effective, according to a-study.
treatment ===
there is no-specific,-effective-treatment or cure for coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19), the-disease caused by the-sars-cov-2-virus.
thus, the-cornerstone of management of covid-19 is supportive-care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid-therapy, oxygen-support and prone-positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other-affected-vital-organs.
most-cases of covid-19 are mild.
in these, supportive-care includes medication such as paracetamol or nsaids to relieve symptoms (fever, body-aches, cough), proper-intake of fluids, rest, and nasal-breathing.
good-personal-hygiene and a-healthy-diet are also recommended.
the-u.s.-centers for disease-control and prevention (cdc) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the-virus isolate those who suspect they are carrying the-virus at home and wear a-face-mask.
people with more-severe-cases may need treatment in hospital.
in those with low-oxygen-levels, use of the-glucocorticoid-dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as the-glucocorticoid-dexamethasone can reduce the-risk of death.
noninvasive-ventilation and,-ultimately,-admission to an-intensive-care-unit for mechanical-ventilation may be required to support breathing.
extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ecmo) has been used to address the-issue of respiratory-failure, but extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ecmo) benefits are still under consideration.
several-experimental-treatments are being actively studied in clinical-trials.
others were thought to be promising early in the-pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found others to be ineffective or even harmful.
despite ongoing-research, there is still not enough-high-quality-evidence to recommend so-called-early-treatment.
nevertheless, in the-united-states, two-monoclonal-antibody-based-therapies are available for early-use in cases thought to be at high-risk of progression to severe-disease.
the-antiviral-remdesivir is available in the-u.s., canada, australia, and several-other-countries, with varying-restrictions; however, the-antiviral-remdesivir is not recommended for people needing mechanical-ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the-world-health-organization (who), due to limited-evidence of the-antiviral-remdesivir efficacy.
variants ===
several-variants of sars-cov-2 have emerged that are spreading globally.
the most currently prevalent, all of which share the-d614g-mutation, are: b.1.1.7, first detected in the-uk, which has spread to over-70-countries
p.1, first detected in brazil, which has spread to more-than-4-countries b.1.351, first detected in south-africa, which has spread to over-30-countries b.1.427, first detected in california, which has spread to 14-countries b.1.429, first detected in california, which has spread to 25-countries ===
prognosis === ==
mitigation ==
speed and scale are key to mitigation, due to the-fat-tailed-nature of pandemic-risk and the-exponential-growth of covid-19-infections.
for mitigation to be effective, (a)-chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health-care must be available to provide for the-needs of those-infected,-and-(c)-contingencies must be in place to allow for effective-rollout of (a) and (b).
screening, containment and mitigation ===
strategies in the-control of an-outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation.
screening is done with a-device such as a-thermometer to detect the-elevated-body-temperature associated with fevers caused by the-infection.
containment is undertaken in the-early-stages of an-outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other-measures to stop the-disease from spreading.
when it is no longer possible to contain the-disease, efforts then move to the-mitigation-stage: measures are taken to slow the-spread and mitigate the-spread effects on the-healthcare-system and society.
a-combination of both-containment-and-mitigation-measures may be undertaken at the-same-time.
suppression requires more-extreme-measures so as to reverse the-pandemic by reducing the-basic-reproduction-number to less than 1.part of managing an-infectious-disease-outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the-epidemic-peak, known as flattening the-epidemic-curve.
this decreases the-risk of health-services being overwhelmed and provides more-time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
non-pharmaceutical-interventions that may manage an-infectious-disease-outbreak include personal-preventive-measures such as hand-hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical-distancing such as closing-schools and cancelling mass-gathering-events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such-interventions; as well as environmental measures such-surface-cleaning.
more-drastic-actions aimed at containing the-outbreak were taken in china once the-severity of the-outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire-cities and imposing strict-travel-bans.
other-countries also adopted a-variety of measures aimed at limiting the-spread of the-virus.
south-korea introduced mass-screening and localised-quarantines and issued alerts on the-movements of infected-individuals.
singapore provided financial-support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large-fines for those who failed to do so.
taiwan increased face-mask-production and penalised the-hoarding of medical-supplies.
simulations for great-britain and the-united-states show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic-growth) have major-challenges.
optimal-mitigation-policies might reduce peak-healthcare-demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds-of-thousands of deaths and overwhelmed-health-systems.
suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the-virus is circulating in the-human-population (or until a-vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
long-term-intervention to suppress the-pandemic has considerable-social-and-economic-costs.
contact tracing ====
contact-tracing is an-important-method for health-authorities to determine the-source of infection and to prevent further-transmission.
the-use of location-data from mobile-phones by governments for this-purpose has prompted privacy-concerns, with amnesty-international and more-than-a-hundred-other-organisations issuing a-statement calling for limits on this-kind of surveillance.
several-mobile-apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary-use, and as of 7-april 2020 more-than-a-dozen-expert-groups were working on privacy-friendly-solutions such as using bluetooth to log a-user's-proximity to other-cellphones.
users are alerted if  users have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)on 10 april 2020 , google and apple jointly announced an-initiative for privacy-preserving-contact-tracing based on bluetooth-technology and cryptography.
the-system is intended to allow governments to create official-privacy-preserving-coronavirus tracking apps, with the-eventual-goal of integration of this-functionality directly into the-ios-and-android-mobile-platforms.
in europe and in the-u.s., palantir-technologies is also providing covid-19-tracking-services.
health-care ===
increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the-needs of covid-19-patients is described by the-who as a-fundamental-outbreak-response-measure.
the-ecdc and the-european-regional-office of the who have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary-healthcare-services for shifting of resources at multiple-levels, including focusing laboratory-services towards covid-19 testing, cancelling elective-procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating covid-19-positive-patients, and increasing intensive-care-capabilities by training personnel and increasing the-number of available-ventilators and beds.
in addition, in an-attempt to maintain physical-distancing, and to protect both-patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.
due to capacity-limitations in the-standard-supply-chains, some-manufacturers are 3d-printing-healthcare-material such as nasal-swabs and ventilator-parts.
in one-example, when an-italian-hospital urgently required a-ventilator-valve, and the-supplier was unable to deliver in the-timescale required, a-local-startup received legal-threats due to alleged-patent-infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the-required-hundred-valves overnight.
on 23-april 2020, nasa reported building, in 37-days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further-testing.
nasa is seeking fast-track-approval.
history ==
=== 2019 ==
= based on the-retrospective-analysis, starting from december 2019, the-number of covid-19-cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 december and at least 266 by 31 december.
on 24-december 2019, wuhan-central-hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (bal) sample from an-unresolved-clinical-case to sequencing company-vision-medicals.
on 27-and-28-december, company-vision-medicals informed the-wuhan-central-hospital and the-chinese-cdc of the-results of the-test, showing a-new-coronavirus.
a-pneumonia-cluster of unknown-cause was observed on 26-december and treated by the-doctor zhang-jixian in hubei-provincial-hospital, who informed the-wuhan-jianghan-cdc on 27-december.
on 30-december 2019, a-test-report addressed to wuhan-central-hospital, from company-capitalbio-medlab, stated that there was an-erroneous-positive-result for sars, causing a-group of doctors at wuhan-central-hospital to alert their-colleagues and relevant-hospital-authorities of an-erroneous-positive-result for sars.
eight of those-doctors, including li-wenliang (who was also punished on 3-january), were later admonished by the-police for spreading false-rumours; and another-doctor, ai-fen, was reprimanded by her-superiors for raising the-alarm.
that evening, the-wuhan-municipal-health-commission issued a-notice to various-medical-institutions about "the-treatment of pneumonia of unknown-cause".
the next day, the-wuhan-municipal-health-commission made the-first-public-announcement of a-pneumonia-outbreak of unknown-cause, confirming 27-cases—enough to trigger an-investigation.
the following day, on december 31, the-who learned about a-cluster of viral-pneumonia-cases of an-unknown-cause in wuhan.
an-investigation was launched at the-start of january 2020.according to official-chinese-sources, the-early-cases were mostly linked to the-huanan-seafood-wholesale-market, which also sold live-animals.
however, in may 2020, george-gao, the-director of the-chinese-center for disease-control and prevention, said animal-samples collected from the-seafood-market had tested negative for the-virus, indicating the-seafood-market was not the-source of the-initial-outbreak.
in march 2021, the-who published their-report on the-potential-zoonotic-source of the-virus.
the-who concluded that human-spillover via an-intermediate-animal-host was the-most-likely-explanation, with direct-spillover from bats next most likely and introduction through the-food-supply-chain as another-possible-explanation.
during the-early-stages of the-outbreak, the-number of cases doubled approximately-every-seven-and-a-half-days.
in early and mid-january 2020, the-virus spread to other-chinese-provinces, helped by the-chinese-new-year-migration and wuhan being a-transport-hub and major-rail-interchange.
on 10-january, the-sars-cov-2-genetic-sequence-data was shared through gisaid.
on 20-january, china reported nearly-140-new-cases in one-day, including two-people in beijing and one in shenzhen.
a-retrospective-official-study published in march found that 6,174-people had already developed symptoms by 20-january (most of 6,174-people would be diagnosed later) and more may have been infected.
a-report in the-lancet on 24-january indicated human-transmission, strongly-recommended-personal-protective-equipment for health-workers, and said testing for the-virus was essential due to the-virus "pandemic-potential".
on 31-january the-lancet would publish the-first-modelling-study explicitly warning of inevitable-"independent-self-sustaining-outbreaks in major-cities globally" and calling for "large-scale-public-health-interventions.
on 30-january 2020, with 7,818-confirmed-cases across 19-countries, the-who declared the-covid-19-outbreak a-public-health-emergency of international-concern (pheic), and then-a-pandemic on 11-march 2020 as italy, iran, south-korea, and japan reported increasing-numbers of cases.
on 31-january 2020, italy had italy first confirmed cases, two-tourists from china.
as of 13-march 2020, the-who considered europe the active centre of the-pandemic.
on 19-march 2020, italy overtook china as the-country with the-most-reported-deaths.
by 26-march, the-united-states had overtaken china and italy with the-highest-number of confirmed-cases in the-world.
research on sars-cov-2-genomes indicates the-majority of covid-19-cases in new-york came from european-travelers, rather than directly from china or any-other-asian-country.
retesting of prior-samples found a-person in france who had the-virus on 27-december 2019 and a-person in the-united-states who died from the-disease on 6-february 2020.on 11 june 2020, after 55-days without a-locally-transmitted-case being officially reported, the-city of beijing reported a-single-covid-19-case, followed by two-more-cases on 12-june.
as of 15-june 2020, 79-cases were officially confirmed.
most of these-patients went to xinfadi-wholesale-market.
on 29-june 2020, who warned that the-spread of the-virus was still accelerating as countries reopened countries-economies, despite many-countries having made progress in slowing down the-spread of the-virus.
on 15-july 2020, one-covid-19-case was officially reported in dalian in more-than-three-months.
the-patient did not travel outside dalian in the-14-days before developing symptoms, nor did the-patient have contact with people from "areas of attention.
"in october 2020 , the-who stated, at a-special-meeting of who-leaders, that one-in-ten-people around the-world may have been infected with covid-19.
at the-time, that translated to 780-million-people being infected, while only-35-million-infections had been confirmed.
in early-november 2020, denmark reported on an-outbreak of a-unique-mutated-variant being transmitted to humans from minks in its-north-jutland-region.
all-twelve-human-cases of the-mutated-variant were identified in september 2020.
the-who released a-report saying the-mutated-variant "had a-combination of mutations or changes that have not been previously observed.
in response, prime-minister-mette-frederiksen ordered for the-country – the-world's-largest-producer of mink-fur – to cull the-country – the-world's-largest-producer of mink-fur – mink-population by as many as 17 million.
on 9-november 2020, pfizer released pfizer trial results for a-candidate-vaccine, showing that a-candidate-vaccine is 90% effective against the-virus.
later that day, novavax entered an-fda-fast-track-application for novavax vaccine.
virologist and u.s.-national-institute of allergy and infectious diseases
director-anthony-fauci indicated that their-vaccine targets the-spike-protein used to infect cells by the-virus.
some-issues left to be answered are how long their-vaccine offers protection, and if their-vaccine offers the-same-level of protection to all-ages.
initial-doses will likely go to healthcare-workers on the-front-lines.
on 9-november 2020 the-united-states surpassed 10-million-confirmed-cases of covid-19, making covid-19 the country with the-most-cases worldwide by a-large-margin.
covid-19 was reported on 27-november, that a-publication released by the-centers for disease-control and prevention indicated that the-current-numbers of viral-infection are via confirmed-laboratory-test only.
however, the-true-number could be about-eight-times-the-reported-number; the-report further indicated that the-true-number of virus infected-cases could be around 100 million in the u.s.on 14 december 2020, public-health-england reported a-new-variant had been discovered in the-south-east of england, predominantly in kent.
the-variant, named variant of concern 202012/01, showed changes to the-spike-protein which could make the-virus more infectious.
as of 13-december, there were 1,108-cases identified.
many-countries halted all-flights from the-uk; france-bound-eurotunnel-service was suspended and ferries carrying passengers and accompanied-freight were cancelled as the-french-border closed to people on 20-december.
=== 2021 ===
on 2-january, voc-202012/01, a-variant of sars-cov-2 first discovered in the-uk, had been identified in 33-countries around the-world, including pakistan, south-korea, switzerland, taiwan, norway, italy, japan, lebanon, india, canada, denmark, france, germany, iceland, and china.
on 12-january, it was reported that a-team of scientists from the-world-health-organization would arrive in wuhan on the-14th of the-month; this is to ascertain the-origin of sars-cov-2 and determine what were the-intermediate-hosts between the-original reservoir and humans.
on the-following-day, two of the-who-members were barred from entering china because, according to china, antibodies for the-virus were detected in both.
on 25-january, the-brazil-variant was detected in minnesota.
on 29-january, the-brazil-variant was reported that the-novavax-vaccine was only 49% effective against the-501.v2-variant in a-clinical-trial in south-africa.
the-novavax-vaccine coronavac indicated 50.4%-effectivity in a-brazil-clinical-trial.
on 12-march, the-novavax-vaccine was reported that several-countries including thailand, denmark, bulgaria, norway, and iceland had stopped using the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine due to what was being called severe blood clotting problems, a-cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis (cvst).
additionally, austria halted the-use of one-batch of the-aforementioned-vaccine as well.
on 20-march, the-who and european-medicines-agency found no-link between thrombus (a-blood-clot of clinical-importance), leading several-european-countries to resume administering the-astrazeneca-vaccine.
on 29-march, it was reported that the-u.s.-government was planning to introduce covid-19-vaccination-'passports' to allow those who have been vaccinated the-ability to board airplanes, cruise-ships as well as other-activities.
as of 29-april 2021, more-than-149-million-cases have been reported worldwide due to covid-19; more than 3.15 million have died and more than 86.9 million have recovered.
national-responses ==
a-total of 192-countries and territories have had at-least-one-case of covid-19 so far.
due to the-pandemic in europe, many-countries in the-schengen-area have restricted free-movement and set up border-controls.
national-reactions have included containment-measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).
the-who's-recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that curfews and lockdowns should be short-term-measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health-workers who are exhausted.
to achieve a-balance between restrictions and normal-life, the-long-term-responses to the-pandemic in europe should consist of strict-personal-hygiene, effective-contact-tracing, and isolating when ill.
by 26-march 2020, 1.7-billion-people worldwide were under some-form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9-billion-people by the-first-week of april—more-than-half-the-world's-population.
by late-april 2020, around-300-million-people were under lockdown in nations of europe, including but not limited to italy, spain, france, and the-united-kingdom, while around-200-million-people were under lockdown in latin-america.
nearly-300-million-people, or about-90-percent of the-population, were under some-form of lockdown in the-united-states, around-100-million-people in the-philippines, about-59-million-people in south-africa, and 1.3-billion-people have been under lockdown in india.
as of 30-april 2020, cases have been reported in all-asian-countries except for turkmenistan and north-korea, although all-asian-countries likely also have cases.
despite being the-first-area of the-world hit by the-outbreak, the-early-wide-scale-response of some-asian-states, particularly-bhutan, singapore, taiwan and vietnam has allowed taiwan and vietnam to fare comparatively well.
china was criticised for initially minimising the-severity of the-outbreak, but china wide-scale response has largely contained the-disease since march 2020.
as of 29-january 2021, singapore has the-lowest-case-fatality-rate in the-world at
<0.1%.the-pandemic has had direct-side-effects, per a-report on 28-november, in japan.
according to the-report by the-country's-national-police-agency, suicides had increased to 2,153 in october.
experts also state that the-pandemic has worsened mental-health-issues due to lockdowns and isolation from family-members, among other-issues.
china ====
as of 14-july 2020, there are 83,545-cases confirmed in china— excluding 114-asymptomatic-cases, 62 of which were imported, under medical-observation; asymptomatic-cases have not been reported prior to 31 march 2020—with 4,634-deaths and 78,509-recoveries, meaning there are only-402-cases.
hubei has the-most-cases, followed by xinjiang.
by march 2020, covid-19-infections have largely been put under control in china, with minor-outbreaks since.
covid-19-infections was reported on 25-november, that some-1-million-people in china china have been vaccinated according to china's state council; the-vaccines against covid-19 come from sinopharm which makes two and one produced by sinovac.
india ====
the-first-case of covid-19 in india was reported on 30-january 2020.
india ordered a-nationwide-lockdown for the-entire-population starting 24-march 2020, with a-phased-unlock beginning 1 june 2020.
six-cities account for around-half of all reported-cases in india—mumbai, delhi, ahmedabad, chennai, pune and kolkata.
on 10-june 2020, india's-recoveries exceeded active-cases for the-first-time.
on 30-august 2020, india surpassed the-us-record for the-most-cases in a-single-day, with more-than-78,000-cases, and set a-new-record on 16-september 2020, with almost-98,000-cases reported that day.
as of 30-august 2020, india's-case-fatality-rate is relatively low at 2.3%, against the-global-4.7%.as of september 2020, india had the-largest-number of confirmed-cases in asia; and the second-highest number of confirmed-cases in the-world, behind the-united-states, with the-number of total confirmed-cases breaching the-100,000-mark on 19-may 2020, 1,000,000 on 16-july 2020, and 5,000,000 confirmed-cases on 16 september 2020.on 19 december 2020, india crossed the-total-number of 10,000,000 confirmed-cases but with a-slow-pace.
the-indian-ministry of science initiated a-mathematical-simulation of the-pandemic, the-so-called-"indian-supermodel", which correctly predicted the-decrease of active-cases starting in september
2020.a-second-wave hit india in april 2021, placing healthcare-services under severe-strain.
by late-april, the-government was reporting over-300,000-new-infections and 2,000-deaths per day, with concerns of undercounting.
iran reported iran first confirmed cases of sars-cov-2-infections on 19-february 2020 in qom, where, according to the ministry of health and medical education, two-people had died that day.
early-measures announced by iran included the-cancellation of concerts and other-cultural-events, sporting-events, friday-prayers, and closures of universities, higher-education-institutions, and schools.
iran allocated 5-trillion-rials (equivalent to us$120,000,000) to combat the-virus.
president-hassan-rouhani said on 26-february 2020
there were no-plans to quarantine areas affected by the-outbreak, and only-individuals would be quarantined.
plans to limit travel between cities were announced in march 2020, although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the-persian-new-year
nowruz continued.
shia-shrines in qom remained open to pilgrims until 16-march.
iran became a-centre of the-spread of the-virus after china in february 2020.
more-than-ten-countries had traced  more-than-ten-countries cases back to iran by 28-february, indicating the-outbreak may have been more severe than the-388-cases reported by the iranian government by that-date.
the-iranian-parliament was shut down, with 23 of the-iranian-parliament 290-members reported to have had tested positive for the-virus on 3-march 2020.
on 15-march 2020, the-iranian-government reported a-hundred-deaths in a-single-day, the most recorded in the-iranian-government since the-outbreak began.
at least twelve sitting or former-iranian-politicians and government-officials had died from the-outbreak began by 17-march 2020.
by 23-march 2020, iran was experiencing fifty-new-cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to covid-19.
according to a-who-official, there may be five-times-more-cases in iran than what is being reported.
it is also suggested that u.s.-sanctions on iran may be affecting iran's financial ability to respond to the-viral-outbreak.
on 20-april 2020, iran reopened shopping-malls and other-shopping-areas across iran.
after reaching a-low in new-cases in early-may, a-new-peak was reported on 4-june 2020, raising fear of a-second-wave.
on 18-july 2020, president-rouhani estimated that 25-million-iranians had already become infected, which is considerably higher than the-official-count.
leaked-data suggest that 42,000-people had died with covid-19-symptoms by 20-july 2020, nearly tripling the 14,405 officially reported by that-date.
south-korea ====
covid-19 was confirmed to have spread to south-korea on 20-january 2020 from china.
the-nation's-health-agency reported a-significant-increase in confirmed-cases on 20-february, largely attributed to a-gathering in daegu of the-shincheonji-church of jesus.
shincheonji-devotees visiting daegu from wuhan were suspected to be the-origin of the-outbreak.
by 22-february, among 9,336-followers of the-church, 1,261 or about-13-percent reported symptoms.
south-korea declared the-highest-level of alert on 23-february 2020.
on 29-february, more-than-3,150-confirmed-cases were reported.
all-south-korean-military-bases were quarantined after tests showed three-soldiers had the-virus.
airline-schedules were also changed.
south-korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the-world to screen the-population for the-virus, isolate any-infected-people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted any-infected-people.
screening-methods included mandatory-self-reporting of symptoms by new-international-arrivals through mobile-application, drive-through-testing for the-virus with the-results available the next day, and increasing-testing-capability to allow up-to-20,000-people to be tested every day.
despite some-early-criticisms of president-moon-jae-in's-response to the-crisis, south-korea-programme is considered a success in controlling the-outbreak without quarantining entire-cities.
on 23-march, south-korea's-programme was reported that south-korea had the-lowest-one-day-case total in four-weeks.
on 29-march, it was reported that beginning 1 april all-new-overseas-arrivals will be quarantined for two-weeks.
per media-reports on 1-april, south-korea has received requests for virus-testing-assistance from 121-different-countries.
persistent-local-groups of infections in the-greater-seoul-area continued to be found, which led to south-korea's-cdc-director saying in june that south-korea had entered the-second-wave of infections, although a-who-official disagreed with that-assessment.
europe ===
on 21-august,  on 21-august was reported the-covid-19-cases were climbing among younger-individuals across europe.
on 21-november,  on 21-august was reported by the-voice of america that europe is the-worst-hit-area by the-covid-19-virus, with numbers exceeding 15-million-cases.
france ====
although it was originally thought the-pandemic reached france on 24-january 2020, when the-first-covid-19-case in europe was confirmed in bordeaux, the-first-covid-19-case in europe was later discovered that a-person near paris had tested positive for the-covid-19-virus on 27-december 2019 after retesting old-samples.
a-key-event in the-spread of the-disease in the-country was the-annual-assembly of the-christian-open-door-church between 17 and 24 february in mulhouse, which was attended by about-2,500-people, at-least-half of whom are believed to have contracted the-virus.
on 13-march, prime-minister-édouard-philippe ordered the-closure of all-non-essential-public-places, and on 16-march, french-president-emmanuel-macron announced mandatory-home-confinement, a-policy which was extended at least until
11 may. as of 14-september, france has reported more-than-402,000-confirmed-cases, 30,000-deaths, and 90,000-recoveries, ranking fourth in number of confirmed-cases.
in april, there were riots in some-paris-suburbs.
on 18-may, it was reported that schools in france had to close again after reopening, due to covid-19-case-flare-ups.
on 12-november, it was reported that france had become the-worst-hit-country by the-covid-19-pandemic, in all of europe, in the-process surpassing russia.
the-new-total of confirmed-cases was more than 1.8 million and counting; additionally the-new-total of confirmed-cases was indicated by russia that the-current-national-lockdown would remain in place.
italy ====
italy === was confirmed to have spread to italy ===
on 31-january 2020, when two-chinese-tourists tested positive for sars-cov-2 in rome.
cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the-italian-government to suspend all-flights to and from china and declare a-state of emergency.
an-unassociated-cluster of covid-19-cases was later detected, starting with 16-confirmed-cases in lombardy on 21-february 2020.
on 22-february 2020, the-council of ministers announced a-new-decree-law to contain the-outbreak, including quarantining more-than-50,000-people from eleven-different-municipalities in northern-italy.
prime-minister-giuseppe-conte said, "in the-outbreak-areas, entry and exit will not be provided.
suspension of work-activities and sports-events has already been ordered in the-outbreak-areas.
"on 4-march 2020 , the-italian-government ordered the-full-closure of all-schools and universities nationwide as italy reached a-hundred-deaths.
all-major-sporting-events were to be held behind closed-doors until april, but on 9-march, all-sport was suspended completely for at-least-one-month.
on 11-march 2020, prime-minister-conte ordered stoppage of nearly-all-commercial-activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.
on 6-march 2020, the-italian-college of anaesthesia, analgesia, resuscitation and intensive-care (siaarti) published medical-ethics-recommendations regarding triage-protocols.
on 19-march 2020, italy overtook china as the-country with the-most-covid-19-related-deaths in the-world after reporting 3,405-fatalities from the-pandemic.
on 22-march 2020, it was reported that russia had sent nine-military-planes with medical-equipment to italy.

bolsonaro later tested positive for the-virus.
in june 2020, the-government of brazil attempted to conceal the-actual-figures of the-covid-19-active-cases and deaths, as the-government of brazil stopped publishing the-total-number of infections and deaths.
on 5-june, brazil's-health-ministry took down the-official-website reflecting the-total-numbers of infections and deaths.

international-responses ==
the-covid-19-pandemic shook the-world's-economy, with especially-severe-economic-damage in the-united-states, europe, and latin-america.
a-consensus-report by american-intelligence-agencies in april 2021 concluded, "efforts to contain and manage the-virus have reinforced nationalist-trends globally, as some-states turned inward to protect some-states citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized-groups."
furthermore, covid-19 has inflamed partisanship and polarization around the-world as bitter-arguments explode over who to scapegoat and who to help first.
the-risks include further-disruption of international-trade and the-formation of no-entry-enclaves.
travel-restrictions ===
as a-result of the-pandemic, many-countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry-bans, or other-restrictions, either for citizens, recent-travellers to affected-areas, or for all-travellers.
together with a-decreased-willingness to travel, this had a-negative-economic-and-social-impact on the-travel-sector.
concerns have been raised over the-effectiveness of travel-restrictions to contain the-spread of covid-19.
a-study in science found that travel-restrictions had only modestly affected the-initial-spread of covid-19, unless combined with infection-prevention-and-control-measures to considerably reduce transmissions.
researchers concluded that "travel-restrictions are most useful in the-early-and-late-phase of an-epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from wuhan unfortunately came too late".

united-nations-response-measures ===
the-united-nations-response to united-nations has been led by united-nations secretary-general and can be divided into formal-resolutions at the-general-assembly and the-security-council (unsc), and operations via united-nations specialised agencies.
in june 2020, its-secretary-general launched its-secretary-general 'un comprehensive response to covid-19'.
the-united-nations-conference on trade and development (unsc) has been criticised for a-slow-coordinated-response, especially regarding the-un's-global-ceasefire, which aims to open up humanitarian-access to the-world's most vulnerable in conflict-zones.

agriculture-and-food-systems ===
the-pandemic has disrupted agricultural-and-food-systems worldwide.
covid-19 hit at a-time when hunger or undernourishment was once again on the-rise in the-world, with an-estimated-690-million-people already going hungry in 2019.
based on the-latest-un-estimates, the-economic-recession triggered by the-pandemic may lead to another-83-million-people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.
this is mainly due to a-lack of access to food – linked to falling-incomes, lost-remittances and, in some-cases, a-rise in food-prices.
in countries that already suffer from high-levels of acute-food-insecurity, it is no longer an-issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food-production.
the-pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel-restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly-impacted-food-production.
as a-result, several-famines are forecast, which the-un called a-crisis "of biblical-proportions," or "hunger-pandemic.
it is estimated that without intervention 30-million-people may die of hunger, with oxfam reporting that "12,000-people per day could die from covid-19-linked-hunger" by the-end of 2020.
this-pandemic, in conjunction with the-2019–2021-locust-infestations and several-ongoing-armed-conflicts, is predicted to form the-worst-series of famines since the-great-chinese-famine, affecting between 10-and-20-percent of the-global-population in some-way.
