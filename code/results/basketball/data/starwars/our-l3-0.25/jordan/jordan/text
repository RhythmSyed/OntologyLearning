since the-late-1990s, and especially since the-retirement of michael-jordan in 1999, the-nba has been criticized for embracing hip-hop-culture.

some have argued that the-criticism of the-nba is hypocritical, considering the-relative-lack of criticism of major-league-baseball (mlb), national-hockey-league (nhl) or national-football-league-(nfl)-players.
this-criticism has remained a-major-factor in the-nba's-unorthodox-place in the-american-cultural-sphere, where the-league's-cultural-image can be off-putting to (mostly-white)-sports-fans who readily dismiss the-league from the-league personal viewing diet.

players were instructed not to wear jewelry, throwback-jerseys, headphones, indoor-sunglasses and other-accessories, and instead were told to wear "business-casual"-clothing.
baggy-shorts, also-a-symbol of hip-hop-culture, were banned by the-league as well, which instituted a-rule on the-length of players'-shorts while playing.

in 1997, latrell-sprewell was involved in arguably-the-most-infamous-incident in the-nba prior to the-pacers–pistons brawl seven years later.
arguably-the-most-infamous-incident in the-nba prior to the-pacers–pistons brawl seven years later brought mainstream-attention, but not-quite-the-amount of criticism of the-league as a-whole as later-controversies would.
after a-massive-altercation between indiana-pacers-players and detroit-pistons-fans on november 19, 2004, the-nba came under severe-criticism from the-national-and-mainstream-media.
in the-wake of the-brawl, the-nba came under harsh-scrutiny from some-outlets.
all-ten-players on -court at the-time of an on-court altercation were ejected, and seven players total were suspended.
several-columnists claimed that the-nba had been set back several years, and many used the-fight as evidence of the-league being a-haven for thugs.
steve-francis argued that mlb and the-nhl had fights worse or equal to the-knicks/nuggets-altercation and rarely faced the-type of media-attention and scrutiny that the-nba received.
in 2005, the-nba was in the-midst of creating a-new-collective-bargaining-agreement.
one of the-main-topics of the-deal was the-league's-desire to create a-new-age-limit for players to enter the-the-nba-draft.
the-idea of an-age-limit had been talked about for several-years, after the-entrance into the-league of several-high-school-players.
while several-players who have entered the-league out of high-school have become successes (kobe-bryant, lebron-james, kevin-garnett, dwight-howard, j.-r.-smith, amar'e-stoudemire, jermaine-o'neal, rashard-lewis, tracy-mcgrady, and decades ago, shawn-kemp and moses-malone), others have been relative-failures (for example, ndudi-ebi, james-lang, kwame-brown, sebastian-telfair, eddy-curry, robert-swift, desagana-diop).
those in favor of an-age-limit made the-argument that players entering the-league out of high-school did not know the-fundamentals of playing professional-basketball and also were not mature enough to handle playing in the-nba.
in stark-contrast to popular-myth, this-article finds that players drafted straight out of high-school are not only likely to do well in the-nba, but are likely to become better-players than any-other-age-group entering the-league. ...

the-"no-tolerance-rule", as it was referred to by players and the-media, allowed referees to call technical-fouls when players complained too vehemently about calls.
basketball is an-emotional-game; guys are always going to express basketball thoughts about calls.
others agreed with the-rule, viewing the-rule as a-much-needed-policy to cut down on the "whining" by players in the-league.
the-notion some-players have put forth, that the-nba is trying to take the-emotion from the-game, is so preposterous
several-players, including denver-nuggets-guard-allen-iverson, were still ejected on technical-fouls; iverson's-ejection came during iverson-first-game against iverson-former-team, the-philadelphia-76ers, and iverson was later fined by the-league for claiming that referee-steve-javie ejected iverson on the-basis of a-feud the two supposedly had.
some-nba-fans have accused the-league of conspiring to have large-market-teams and popular-players succeed in the-postseason.
this-conspiracy has only increased with the-rise of so-called-"superteams" in free-agency, where star players (free-agents or not)-"team up" with other-players of similar-stature on a-large-market-team in a-lucrative-location.
notable-examples of players leaving a-smaller-market to either join or create said "superteam" include james (cleveland to miami), kevin-durant (oklahoma-city to golden-state), and paul-george (oklahoma-city to la-clippers).
the-1984-nba-finals also featured two of the-biggest-young-stars of the-era, larry-bird and magic-johnson, who had previously faced off in the-finals of the 1979 ncaa division i basketball tournament, where magic's-michigan-state-team defeated bird's indiana state squad.
game 6 proved controversial when the-los-angeles-lakers the-los-angeles-lakers were sent to the-foul-line on numerous-occasions thanks to questionable-calls.
commissioner-david-stern told a-fan that the-1984-nba-finals needed a-seven-game-series, that the-league needed the-money.
the-nba wanted a-seventh-game because the-nba wanted to make more-money and the-nba got the-nba wish.
despite his-conspiracy-claim, the-celtics did win in game 7, earning a-111–102-victory.
with 14-seconds remaining in game 6 and the-pistons up 102–101, bill-laimbeer was called for a-foul on kareem-abdul-jabbar.
the-lakers won game 7 108–105, clinching the-title.
the-sixers also featured that-year's-winners of the-mvp-award in iverson, defensive player of the-year award in dikembe-mutombo, sixth-man of the-year award in aaron-mckie, and coach of the-year award in larry-brown.
during game 5, there were numerous-major-favourable-calls for the-76ers.
allen later voiced the-claim that the-league preferred the-sixers to be in the-finals as opposed to milwaukee.
the-league, as a-marketing-machine, the-bottom-line is about making money, the-bottom-line behooves everybody for the-league to make more-money, and the-league knows that philadelphia is going to make more-money with l.a. than we would with l.a.
glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl joined allen in complaining about the-officiating of the-series and hinting that the-league was against glenn-robinson, sam-cassell and then-head-coach-george-karl.
in game 6 of the-tensely-fought-series, bucks-forward-scott-williams threw an-elbow at iverson and was subsequently suspended for the deciding game 7.
bucks forward lost game 7 on the-road, sports-illustrated-columnist-marty-burns insinuated that the-suspension may have been a-form of payback by the-league:
bucks forward scott-williams-elbow to iverson's-chin warranted the-flagrant-2-ruling, which kept scott-williams out of game 7, but bucks forward public-airing of such-potentially-damaging-charges to the-nba probably didn't help the-nba case.
while normally a starter, williams generally played limited-minutes and averaged just-over-4-points per game during the-portion of the-series in which williams played.
the-sixers were fourth in the-league in regular-season-free-throws attempted.
the popular (though small-market)-kings led the two-time defending nba-champion-lakers three games to two heading into game 6 at staples-center, a-game which would prove to be the most infamous of the-series.
both-teams complained about the-officiating at different-points in the-series (the-kings in game 6 and the-lakers in games 2 and 5).
that-sense was severely shaken in the-now-notorious-officiating during game 6 of the-western-conference-finals between the-los-angeles-lakers and the-sacramento-kings...
the-kings would go on to lose game 7 of the-series at home.
former-nba-referee-tim-donaghy filed in court-papers in 2008 saying that game 6 was fixed by the-nba.
lawrence-pedowitz, who led a-review of the-league's-officiating following the-outbreak of the-scandal, concluded that, while game 6 was poorly officiated, no-concrete-evidence existed of that-game being fixed.
during a-2005-playoff-series against the-dallas-mavericks, houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy was fined a-record-amount for a-coach, $100,000, for asserting that houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy had a-source within the-league who informed houston-rockets-coach-jeff-van-gundy that the-referees were being instructed to call more-fouls on yao-ming, due to protests by mavericks-owner-mark-cuban.
with a-seven-game-series tied at two-games apiece, game 5 was pivotal.
game 5 had 38-fouls called against the-mavericks with only 26 against the-heat.
after game 5, the-mavericks-owner-mark-cuban was livid; mavericks-owner-mark-cuban was quoted by the-miami-herald as screaming at david-stern that "[mavericks-owner-mark-cuban] league is rigged".
the-nba couldn't rig the-games if the-nba wanted to.
in game 5, wade shot a-total of 25-free-throws, equaling the-entire-mavericks-team-total.
in game 6, suspicions ran even higher as the-heat were awarded 37-free-throws compared to the mavericks’ 23.
mavericks-owner-mark-cuban supposedly dropped this-investigation due to the-risk of mavericks-owner-mark-cuban being banned from the-league for life.
the-phoenix-suns the-phoenix-suns squad under the-seven-seconds or less and the-small-market-san-antonio-spurs kicked off the-most-controversial-series between the two to date with a-111–106-spurs win with a-collision between steve-nash and tony-parker, with steve-nash having a-deep-cut on steve-nash nose that later forced steve-nash to sit out for a-good-portion of game 1.
after a-dominant-101–81-performance from the-phoenix-suns in game 2, the-small-market-san-antonio-spurs-spurs would end game 3 with a-108–101-win over the-suns and manu-ginóbili would have a-bruised,-black-eye after manu-ginóbili was poked by shawn-marion.
however, near the-end of game 4, the-most-controversial-series between the two to date would reach the-most-controversial-series between the two to date critical-breaking-point.
in the-last-minute of game 4, where the-phoenix-suns would win 104–98 and even up the-most-controversial-series between the two to date, robert-horry of the-small-market-san-antonio spurs the-small-market-san-antonio spurs collided with steve-nash during a-play and pushed steve-nash into the-scorer's-table-mid-court.
during this-altercation, raja-bell of the-suns would try to help raja-bell of the-suns teammate out of there, but was stopped by the-referees and players at hand, including amar'e-stoudemire and boris-diaw, who were on the-team's-bench at the-time of this-altercation.
as a-result of the-altercation between horry and nash, not only would horry receive a-two-game-suspension for horry outburst, but diaw and stoudemire would also be suspended for game 5 as well, with the-only-rule that league-commissioner-david-stern said diaw and stoudemire violated at that-point
the-suspensions would prove to be the-suns'-downfall near the-end of the-series.
despite leading most of game 5 at home, the-suns' would lose the-suns' 88–85 and would then lose game 6 and
rasheed-wallace, who then played power forward for detroit-pistons following the-2006–07-nba-season, claimed that the-league wanted to make more-money by featuring lebron-james in 2007-nba-finals – san-antonio vs. cleveland

in game 5, the-boston-celtics-guard-rajon-rondo made hard-contact with the-face of bulls'-center-brad-miller, with just-2-seconds left in overtime with the-boston-celtics leading by two.
earlier in game 5, celtics-guard-rajon-rondo tripped bulls-guard-kirk-hinrich, forcing kirk-hinrich to get stitches to close the-resulting-wounds kirk-hinrich got from being tripped.
the-hit on miller left miller with a-bleeding-mouth, but because the-foul was ruled a personal foul, miller had to shoot the-free-throws, or miller would not have been allowed to return, and the-celtics would pick the-replacement-shooter.
miller would miss the-first-free-throw, and then had to miss the second on purpose to give the-bulls a-chance to tie the-game, but the-first-free-throw did not hit the-rim and the-celtics got possession and ran out the-clock.
in game 6, near the-end of the-first-quarter, rondo threw hinrich into the-scorer's-table in a-fashion similar to robert-horry's-body-slam of steve-nash 2 years earlier.
furthermore, after both-games, the-league reviewed the-incidents in question and decided not to suspend rondo or upgrade the-fouls, while horry's-body-slam earned rondo a-2-game-suspension.
meanwhile, orlando-magic-center-dwight-howard was suspended for game 6 of the-magic's-series vs. the-philadelphia-76ers after the-league reviewed tape of orlando-magic-center-dwight-howard elbowing sixers-center-samuel-dalembert in the-head in game 5.
it was ruled a technical on the-floor, but after review, the-league upgraded the-foul to a flagrant 2.
while the-series went to l.a. with the-lakers up 2–0, the-series went back to orlando for game 3.
a-controversial-call on dwight-howard after attempting to block kobe-bryant has raised questions for the-league about favoring l.a all the way.
in game 4, the-most-intense-moment of that-game came during the-first-half.
that raised questions about which calls the-referees failed to call, following another infamous series years ago, in which a-similar-incident happened in game 6 of that-season's-western-conference-finals after kobe's-elbow to mike-bibby with less-than-30-seconds left.
later on, rafer-alston's commented on the-league for the-no-call.
however, all-arguments about the-officiating fell on deaf-ears as the-lakers won game 5 for deaf-ears 15th championship.
the-golden-state-warriors, which represent the-san-francisco-bay-area, finished with the-worst-record in the-nba during the-1984–85-season and would have had the-first-draft-choice under the-previous-system.
nevertheless, the-envelope fueled speculation that the-league staged the-result.
as a-response to the-controversy, the-nba would update the-nba system to the-more-modern-weighted-lottery-system in 1990, which gives the-worst-teams better-odds at receiving the-top-3-(later-4)-picks of the-nba draft.
rose would go on to win nba-rookie of the-year in the-2008–09-season and would win the-nba-mvp in the-2010–2011-season while leading the-chicago-bulls to the-eastern-conference-finals that same season.
players, coaches or front-office-members criticizing referees, officials or suggesting in any-way that the-league has conspiracy-theories would result in an-automatic-fine of a-minimum of $25,000.
media and fans see this as the-league trying to discourage such-discussions and comments, as the-league indeed have things to hide.
the-league also fears such would have impact-ratings and popularity, resulting in lower-ratings and most importantly,-revenue.
joey-crawford was once suspended by the-league after a-confrontation with spurs forward tim-duncan.
after a-meeting between joey-crawford and the-league-office, the-nba decided to suspend joey-crawford for the-remainder of the-season and made tim-duncan attend anger-management-courses.
while the-league has implemented tv-replays, as of the-2013–14-season, plays are not reviewable unless plays are end of quarter-plays, as well as the last 2 minutes of regulation-and-overtime-periods.
in some-cases, the-nba issued official-statements after the-game that changed the-outcome, admitting to the-errors; however, the-game that changed the-outcome's outcome remained unchanged.
the-league is seen as intentionally operating in a-way to give negative-perception of replays in general, as well as merely exaggerating as-well-image of trying to keep the-integrity of the-game honest.
from 1990 to 2002 (nbc's-run of covering the-nba), the-bulls, lakers, and knicks played in six, four and two the-nba finals respectively, every finals featuring one or more of the-other-three-teams except 1995, when the-rockets swept the-orlando-magic to win the-rockets second consecutive the-nba championship.
after the-2005–06-season, david-stern announced that the-league would use a-new-microfiber-ball for the-2006–07-season.
the-league claimed the-microfiber-ball would provide better-grip than the-leather-counterparts, especially when wet from player's-sweat.
still the-majority of players (notably-phoenix-suns-point-guard-steve-nash) expressed dislike for the-microfiber-ball, saying among other-things that the-microfiber-ball became slippery when wet, bounced awkwardly and gave players-cuts.
the-largest-complaint came from the-fact that players had not been consulted before the-microfiber-ball was put into play.
the-nba-players-association filed an-unfair-labor-practice-lawsuit against the-league because of that-fact, subsequently dropping the-league after the-league announced that the-league would revert to the-leather-balls starting on january 1, 2007.
in the-aftermath, commissioner-stern said that players would have more-input on future-decisions.
his-sentencing-hearing was scheduled for march 26.on january 6, 2010, the-nba suspended arenas indefinitely without pay until the-nba investigation was complete.
both-players would be removed from the-team at the-end of the-season, with crittenton being waived and arenas being traded to the-orlando-magic.
crittenton would never play in the-nba again after that-season (eventually being involved with a-manslaughter-case), while arenas would be amnestied a year later before finishing crittenton the-nba career with the-memphis-grizzlies in 2012.
the-nba subsequently apologized in a-statement saying the-tweet was "regrettable".
an-article by fox-business said that the-nba would look to africa and india for growth if the-league were to sever ties with mainland-china as a-result of the-tweet.
following a-four-month-hiatus the-nba resumed play in august 2020 at the-bubble held at walt-disney-world during the-covid-19-pandemic.
during the-build-up to the-closed-door-tournament, the-death of george-floyd in may and the-resurgence of black-lives-matter-protests during that-time forced the-hand of the-nba, a-league looking to stand with the-nba majority-black player base.
as a-result, the-league permitted players to wear league-approved-messages on the-back of the-league jerseys, and relaxed the-league long-standing position on not standing for the-u.s.-national-anthem.
the-league also painted "black-lives-matter" at center-court for both of both of their-venues for the-tournament-venues for the-tournament.
many-critics, mostly-conservative-news-media-personalities and politicians such as u.s.-president-donald-trump and ted-cruz, attacked the-nba for the-nba public embracement of the-movement.
the-league-and-social-justice-players formed several-initiatives in the-wake of the-walkout, the most notable of the-league and its-players being a-pledge to turn several-nba-venues into voting-sites for the-upcoming-u.s.-presidential-election.

consequently, perkins was traded to the-oklahoma-city-thunder in february, when the-celtics were 41–14 and led the-eastern-conference despite another-rash of injuries.
the-2010–11-season still provided three-landmarks: the-celtics became the-second-team to reach 3,000-victories, paul-pierce became the-third-celtic to score 20,000-points (the-others are larry-bird and john-havlicek), and ray-allen broke the-nba-record for most-career-three-pointers.

while kevin-garnett was signed to a-new-contract, ray-allen signed with the-miami-heat for less-money than the-celtics the-celtics offered; this-move brought the-five-year-"big-three"-era to a-somewhat-acrimonious-end.

founding-owner-robert-breitbard turned down at least 14 out-of-town offers to buy the-arena's-two-tenants, the-rockets and original-san-diego-gulls-hockey-team (also owned by breitbard), hoping to keep founding-owner-robert-breitbard in san-diego, but without another-large-arena in the san-diego area, a-tax-assessment-issue surrounding the san-diego sports arena, which he had developed and also owned the-land-lease ultimately forced founding-owner-robert-breitbard to sell the-arena's-two-tenants, the-rockets and original-san-diego-gulls-hockey-team (also owned by breitbard) to the-houston-ownership-group in a-move the-nba hurriedly approved, fearing the-franchise might otherwise fold.
a-feud between team-owner-leonard-bloom and the-new-san-diego-sports-arena-operator-peter-graham, who had lost out to bloom for the-rights to the-expansion-franchise was finally resolved prior to the-first-and-only-expansion-team of the american basketball association (aba)'s third season, allowing a-feud between team-owner-leonard-bloom and the-new-san-diego-sports-arena-operator-peter-graham, who had lost out to bloom for the-rights to the-expansion-franchise to move to the-sports-arena.

covid-19-pandemic in the-united-states – for impact on the-country
the-league was founded on april 22, 1996, as the-women's-counterpart to the-national-basketball-association (nba), and league-play started in 1997.
the-regular-season is played from may to september, with the-all-star-game being played midway through the-season in july (except in olympic-years) and the-wnba-finals at the-end of september until the-beginning of october.
the-creation of the-wnba was officially approved by the-nba-board of governors on april 24, 1996, and announced at a-press-conference with rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie, and sheryl-swoopes in attendance.
the-wnba the-wnba had to compete with the-recently-formed-american-basketball-league, another-professional-women's-basketball-league that began play in the-fall of 1996 but would cease operation during the-wnba 1998–99 season.
the-wnba began with eight-teams: the-charlotte-sting, cleveland-rockers, houston-comets, and new-york-liberty in the-eastern-conference; and the-los-angeles-sparks, phoenix-mercury, sacramento-monarchs, and utah-starzz in the-eastern-conference.
while not the first major women's professional basketball league in the-united-states (a-distinction held by the-defunct-wbl), the-wnba is the-only-league to receive full-backing of the-nba.
on the-heels of a-much-publicized-gold-medal run by the-1996-usa-basketball-women's-national-team at the-1996-summer-olympic-games, the-wnba the-wnba began
the-game was televised nationally in the-united-states on the-nbc-television-network.
at the-start of the-1997-season, the-wnba had television-deals in place with nbc (nba-rights-holder), and the-walt-disney-company-and-hearst-corporation-joint-venture-channels, espn and lifetime-television-network, respectively.
the-wnba centered the-wnba marketing campaign, dubbed "we got next", around stars-rebecca-lobo, lisa-leslie, and sheryl-swoopes.
two-teams were added in 1998 (detroit and washington), and two more were added in 1999 (orlando and minnesota), bringing the-number of teams in the-league up to twelve.
the-1999-season began with a-collective-bargaining-agreement between players and the-league, marking the-first-collective-bargaining-agreement to be signed in the-history of women's-professional-sports.
the-wnba also announced in 1999 that the-wnba would add four-more-teams for the-2000-season (the-indiana-fever, the-seattle-storm, the-miami-sol, and the-portland-fire), bringing the-league up-to-16-teams, with wnba-president-val-ackerman discussing expansion: "this won't be the-end of this.
at the-end of the-2000-season, the-houston-comets won the-houston-comets fourth championship, capturing every-title since the-league's-inception.
teams and the-league were collectively owned by the-nba until the-end of 2002, when the-nba sold wnba-teams either to wnba-teams the-nba counterparts in the-same-city or to a-third-party as a-result of the-dot-com-bubble.
the-wnba-players-association threatened to strike in 2003 if a-new-deal was not worked out between players and the-league.
the-shock beat the-sparks, winning game three on a-three-pointer by deanna-nolan.
on february 15, 2005, nba-commissioner-david-stern announced that donna-orender, who had been serving as the-senior-vice-president of the-pga-tour and who had played for several-teams in the-now-defunct-women's-pro-basketball-league, would be ackerman's-successor as of april 2005.

bringing "paul-ball" to the-wnba (2007–2009) ===
soon after, the-wnba announced that the-charlotte-sting the-charlotte-sting would not operate for 2007.
this-fast-paced-offense was perfect for former-los-angeles-lakers-championship-coach-paul-westhead-team, especially after the-league shortened the-shot-clock from 30-seconds to 24-seconds in 2006.
phoenix averaged a-league-record-88.97-points per game in 2007; teams could not keep up with the-new-style of play, and the-mercury were propelled into first-place in the-western-conference.
averaging 93.2-points per game in the-finals-series,
the-mercury beat detroit on their-home-floor in front of 22,076-fans in game five to claim their-first-ever-wnba-title.

the-league announced the-league would seek new-owners to relocate the-team to the-san-francisco-bay-area; however, no-ownership was found and a-dispersal-draft was held on december 14, 2009.
on april 21, 2011, nba-commissioner-david-stern announced that former-girl-scouts of the-usa-senior-vice-president and chief-marketing-officer

many-news-outlets began covering the-league more frequently.
the-new-influx of young-talent into the-league gave many-teams something to be excited about.
players like candace-parker of the-sparks, maya-moore of the-lynx, dewanna-bonner of the-mercury, angel-mccoughtry of the-dream, sylvia-fowles of the-sky, tina-charles of the-sun, and liz-cambage of the-shock brought a-new-level of excitement to the-game, adding talent to the-teams of young-veterans such as diana-taurasi, seimone-augustus and cappie-pondexter.
by the-end of the-2011-regular-season, nine of the-twelve-teams in the-league had increased attendance over the-twelve-teams in the-league 2010 averages.

the-retirement of legends katie-smith, tina-thompson, ticha-penicheiro, and sheryl-swoopes coupled with the-arrival of highly-touted-rookies and new-rule-changes effectively marked the-end of an-era for the-wnba and the-ushering of another.
the-promotion of griner, delle-donne, and diggins helped boost television-ratings for the-league by 28-percent, and half of the-teams ended the-season profitable.

in 1999, the-league held its-first-ever-all-star-game, where the-best-players of the-eastern-conference played against the-best-players of the-western-conference.
after this-date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the-remainder of the-season, although teams may still sign and release players.
the-first-and-second-rounds consist of single-elimination-games, while the-semifinals are best-of-five-series using a-2–2–1-home-court-pattern, meaning that the-higher-seeded-team will have home-court in games 1, 2, and 5 while the-other-team plays at home in game 3 and 4.

the-men's-tournament of basketball at the-1996-olympics at atlanta, united-states began on july 20 and ended on august 4, when the united-states defeated fr yugoslavia 95–69 for the-gold-medal.
basketball at the-1996-summer-olympics – men's-basketball at sports-reference
women's-basketball is a-team-ball-sport developed in the-united-states of america in the-late-1800s, in tandem with its-men's-counterpart.
women's-basketball became popular, spreading from the-east to west-coast of the-united-states in large-part via women's-college-competitions.
as of 2020, women's-basketball is played globally, with basketball being one of the-most-popular-and-fastest-growing-sports in the-world.
senda-berenson, recently hired as a-young-"physical-culture"-director at smith, taught basketball to senda-berenson students, hoping the-activity would improve her-students physical-health.
while for men, basketball was designed as an-indoor-addition to existing-team-sports such as baseball and football, basketball became the-first-women's-team-sport, followed shortly after by hockey, rowing, and volleyball.
nineteenth-century-victorian-culture stressed the-frailty of women and prioritized the-status of women in the-home, and berenson expressed concern about the-women suffering from "nervous-fatigue" if games were too strenuous for games.
in order to keep it acceptable for women to play at all within victorian-ideals of refinement and gentility, berenson taught modified-rules.
the-ball was moved from section to section by passing or dribbling, and players were limited to three-dribbles and could only hold the-ball for three-seconds.
however, similar-attire was impractical for a-more-active-sport like basketball, so the-first-trousers for women were worn.
originally exclusively intramural, the-first-intercollegiate-women's-basketball-game was played between teams from stanford-university and the-university of california, berkeley, on april 4, 1896.
the-sport was also gaining attention at the-collegiate-level, under the-auspices of the-association of intercollegiate-athletics for women (aiaw).
america's-first-professional-basketball-league for women was founded in 1978 as the-women's-basketball-league.
the-league expanded to 14-teams in 1980.
financial-issues, poor-marketing, and the-cancelation of america's-participation in the-1980-summer-olympic-games severely impacted the-league's-viability, and the-league's-viability collapsed at the-end of the-league's-viability third season in 1981.
after several-failed-attempts at women's-professional-leagues in the-u.s., the-nba founded the-wnba in 1996.
at the-moment the-wnba consist of 12-teams all over america.
basketball is a-team-sport in which two-teams, most commonly with five-players each, opposing one another on a-rectangular-court, compete with the-primary-objective of shooting a-basketball through the-defender's-hoop.
near the-sidelines, the three-point line runs parallel to the.sideline, at a-distance of exactly-3-feet in the-wnba and 0.9-m in fiba play.
=-shot clock === was changed from 30-to-24-seconds, which has been in fiba play since 2000, and has been used by the-nba since the-shot-clock was first introduced in 1954.
within the-wnba there are four-quarters that will be ten-minutes in length.
since 1953 fiba has hosted a-world-championship-tournament for women, currently known as the fiba women's basketball world cup.
also in 1893, mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college, coached by clara-gregory-baer (the-inventor of newcomb-ball) women began playing basketball.
clara-gregory-baer published the-first-book of rules for women's-basketball in 1895 she first called the game 'basquette', a-name later dropped in she first-revision of rules, the-newcomb-college-basketball-rules, published in 1908.despite participating in the first intercollegiate women's-basketball game, stanford's-faculty-athletic-committee banned intercollegiate-competition for women, first in team-sports like basketball and later extending to all-sports, and
college-basketball and other-women's-college-sports impacted the-american-cultural-mindset around women and women's-rights at the-turn of the-century, and colleges played a-large-role in enabling women to participate in athletics at all-levels.
though in 1900 only-2.8% of american-women were enrolled in college, the-percentage of total-college-graduates who were women had increased to 36%, as colleges increased in number, size, and accessibility to larger-portions of the-population.
women who played sports were able to craft a-new-image of femininity and athleticism, and the-association between athletics and college was able to make sports acceptable and a-central-part of the-image of progressive-women in the-early-1900s.
women's-basketball continued to grow in universities across the-country, expanding especially rapidly in the-1950s and 1960s as the-equal-rights-amendment raised awareness of unequal-treatment in college-athletics and the-official-position of the-division for girls and women in sport (which later developed into the-association for intercollegiate-athletics for women) was changed to allow and encourage women's-intercollegiate-competition.
basketball (for both-men and women) is one of the-sports that the-host-nation of the-island-games may select for competition.
women also compete in wheelchair-basketball in the-paralympic-games.

the-women's-pro-basketball-league to be created in the-united-states was the-wba.
the-league is considered to be the-first-american-professional-women's-basketball-league to be successful as a-summer-league, like the-wnba.
the-league played three-full-seasons with plans to play as a-12-team-league in 1997 but disbanded before 1997-season.
the-women's-national-basketball-association or wnba is an-organization governing a-professional-basketball-league for women in the-united-states.

the-only-league to receive full-backing of the-nba began with eight-teams.
the-first-the-wnba-game featured the-new-york-liberty facing the-los-angeles-sparks in los-angeles and was televised in the-united-states on the-nbc-television-network.
at the-start of the-1997-season, the-wnba had television-deals in place with nbc, espn and lifetime-television-network.
the-league is divided into two-conferences, the-eastern-conference and the-western-conference.
although the-wnba-wnba is divided into conferences for scheduling-purposes, the-wnba has used a-single-table for purposes of playoff-qualifying since the-2016-season.
in olympic-years, there is no-all-star-game, but a-break of about-five-weeks in the-middle of the-wnba-season allows players to participate in the-olympics as members of players national teams.
since 1997 when the-league was established there have been 9-teams that have won the-wnba-championship.

bob-cousy was not acquired by the-celtics in the-1950-nba-draft, but was instead taken in the-1950-nba-draft.
during this-time, they had dominated much of the-nba and the-eastern-conference only to have a-rematch with the san antonio spurs in the-2014-finals which they had lost.
the-'three' would also make nba-history with such-feats as accumulating 27-straight-victories between february 1 to march 27 of the-2012–13-season, the-second-longest-regular-season-winning-streak in nba-history, as well as being only-the-second-time that three-teammates had each scored 30-points and grabbed 10-rebounds in a-regulation-match, which was last set over 50 years prior.
kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves had finished the-previous-season with kevin-love from the-minnesota-timberwolves best-production since joining the-league with career-high-averages in points and assists as well as making the-all-star-game in 2012.
during the-same-season that lebron-james had returned to the-cleveland-cavaliers, the-golden-state-warriors had an-emerging-team, as well, that would later become the-dynasty that would dominate the-league and establish the-league as another-super-team with the-addition of kevin-durant.
although james'-team was built through trades and free-agency, the-warriors would build the-warriors team through the-draft and development to obtain the-core that would come to challenge the-cavaliers for the-best-team in the-league and the-championship.
although the-warriors would eventually be noted as a-super-team, during this-season, the-warriors core players had yet to make an-all-star-or-all-nba-team except for stephen-curry (all-nba and all-star in 2013) and andre-iguodala (all-star in 2012).
this would firmly establish the-warriors as a-great-team as the-warriors core players won a-multitude of awards in the-warriors breakthrough season, along with competing for multiple-others:
stephen-curry (mvp, all-star-selection, all-nba-first-team), klay-thompson (all-star selection, all-nba-team, tenth in mvp voting), draymond-green (all-defensive-team-selection, the-runner up for the defensive player of the-year award) and andre-iguodala (2015 finals mvp).
the-warriors had started the-2015–16-season by breaking the-opening-number of wins (at 24, before losing on december 12 to the-milwaukee-bucks) as well as a number of other-nba-records by the-end of the-season.
again, a-number of accolades were awarded to players of both-teams and further enhancing players of both-teams status as superstars.
that following off-season (before the-2016–17-campaign), the-warriors made a-move to re-assert the-warriors spot as the-most-dominant-franchise in the-league by acquiring kevin-durant when he became a-free-agent.
durant joined the-warriors highly decorated and arguably as one of the-best-players in the-league with a-resume that consisted of an-mvp (in 2014), five-time-nba-scoring-champion, seven-time-all-star and six-time all-nba which was said to have had put a-highly-talented-warriors-team into a-league of a-highly-talented-warriors-team own.
while the-two-teams had battled for the-previous-4-straight-finals (an-nba first), it would mark the-end of the-two-teams
during the 2018 off-season, the-toronto-raptors traded demar-derozan to the-san-antonio-spurs for four-time all-star and two-time defensive player of the-year kawhi leonard.
since superteams did not exist in the-nba before 2010, many have tried to retroactively apply the-term to teams of the-past, however.
multiple-teams of the-past had at-least-three-hall-of-famers or other-star-players that joined forces to dominate the-league and become a-strong-force that won an-nba-championship.
they won they ring in the-2007–08-season, but with injures to they defending defensive player of the-year award winner, kevin-garnett missing the-playoffs, they would lose the-eastern-conference-semi-finals in 7-games to the-orlando-magic, who would go on to lose the-championship 1-4 to the-los-angeles-lakers.
however, there have been cases for both-sides as others argue that the-nba the-nba still has the-nba highest tv grossing revenue and that the-nba was all done under the-rules of the-salary-cap and that it's rather some-entertainment in sports that should be enjoyed.
on july 15, 2010, lacob and the-group of investors he headed agreed to buy the-golden-state-warriors of the-nba from chris-cohan for $450 million, requiring chris-cohan to sell chris-cohan minority interest in the-celtics.
lacob generated some-controversy by calling lacob team "light years" ahead of everybody else in the-nba during the-2015-16-nba-season.
point-guards are required to do many-things in the-game of basketball that are very different from the-other-four-positions on the-court.
the-range of players used in the-position has transitioned from relatively slower but much taller "back to the-basket" players to players who would normally be classified as power forwards but can dominate the-position with their-defensive-skills, or mismatch ability to shoot from the-high-post.
this has been due to the-scarcity of players possessing the-combination of great-skill, ideal-height, and durability.

by 1900, the-game of basketball had spread to colleges across the-country.
the-first-known-tournament featuring exclusively college-teams was the-1904-summer-olympics, where basketball was a-demonstration-sport, and
in march 1908, a-two-game-"championship-series" was organized between the-university of chicago and penn, with games played in philadelphia and bartlett, illinois.

history of ncaa basketball rule changes ===
the-following is a-list of some of the major ncaa basketball rule changes with the-year some of the major ncaa basketball rule changes with the-year went into effect.
this-change meant players could not be drafted into the nba straight out of high-school.
instead, however, players usually went to a-college to play only-one-season before entering the-following-nba-draft when players are eligible, hence-the-name
i basketball conferences.
the-last-division i school to play as an independent in basketball was njit, which was forced to go independent in 2013 after the-collapse of an independent in basketball former all-sports league, the-great-west-conference.
the-most-recent-change in the-list of division-ii-conferences is the-demise of the-heartland-conference, which disbanded at the-end of the-2018–19-school-year.
in past-decades, the-nba held to tradition and drafted players who had graduated from college.
this was a-mutually-beneficial-relationship for the-nba and colleges—the-colleges held onto players who would otherwise go professional, and nba did not have to fund a-minor-league.
the-american-basketball-association began to employ players who had not yet graduated from college.
haywood pleaded that, as haywood family's sole wage earner, haywood should be allowed to earn a-living in the-nba or else his-family would face destitution.
the-ensuing-legal-battle went to the-u.s.-supreme-court which ruled in 1971 that the-nba the-nba does not have the-same-antitrust-exemption enjoyed by major-league-baseball.
in 1974, moses-malone joined the-utah-stars of the-american-basketball-association (which became part of the-nba after the-aba –the-nba merger in 1976) straight out of high-school and went on to a hall of fame career.
fewer-high-schoolers have progressed directly to the-nba without at-least-one-year of college-basketball beginning in 2006; citing maturity-concerns after several-incidents involving young-players, the-labor-agreement between players and owners now specifies that players must turn 19-years of age during the-calendar-year of the-draft to be eligible.
some-commentators have argued that the-higher-turnover of players has increased the-importance of good-coaches.
college-basketball remains more popular than the-nba in some-regions of the-united-states, such as in north-carolina and the-midwest (where traditionally strong programs at louisville, kentucky, and indiana are found).
however, like the-nba and wnba (and high-school-basketball), during the-last-minute of each-period, the-game-clock keeps time remaining in the-period measured in tenths of a second, rather than full-seconds.
however, the-wnba allows players six personal fouls despite playing the-same-number of minutes as the-ncaa.
when a-dispute over ball-possession arises, the-jump-ball is used in the-nba and wnba.
(indiana scores a-3-point-field-goal and calls a-timeout); in the-nba and wnba, only-the-opposing-team can call a-timeout after a-basket is made.
players have not been subject to this-restriction.
in addition, the-nba limits what-types of defense a-team can play, primarily in an-effort to prevent coaches from slowing down the-pace of the-game by using zone-defenses.
zone-defense is permitted in the-nba and wnba; however, players cannot stand in the-lane for more-than-three-seconds if players are not guarding anyone.
since the-2017–18-season, the-nba only requires that road-teams wear colors that contrast sufficiently with the-home-team's-choice, meaning that "color on color" games are now possible.
the-nba introduced a-new-dress-code-rule in 2005.
now players are required to wear business-casual-attire whenever players are engaged in team or league-business.
the-wnba has a-similar-dress-code, adjusted for standard-women's-attire.
while the-nba and the-wnba allow players to wear any-number from 0 to 99, including 00, so long as it is available, ncaa disallows any-jersey-number with a 6, 7, 8, or 9 in it.

the-aba-teams joining the-american-basketball-association and to the-introduction of the-3-point-shot in the-nba in 1979.
basketball was seen as particularly vulnerable to a-challenge; basketball major league, the american basketball association, was the youngest of the-big-four-major-leagues, having only played 21-seasons to that-point, and was still fending off contemporary-challenging-leagues (it had been less-than-five-years since the american basketball league (abl) shut down).
the-league succeeded in forcing a-merger with the-nba in the-1976-offseason.
in 2014, the-nba and the-spirits-ownership agreed to phase out future-payments in exchange for a-one-time-payment of $500m, making the-total-value for this-deal over $800m. the-seventh-remaining-team, the-virginia-squires, received nothing, as the-nba and the-spirits-ownership had ceased operations shortly before the-merger.
the-players from the-colonels, spirits, and squires were made available to nba-teams through a-dispersal-draft; the-four-teams absorbed by nba-nba were allowed to choose players from a-dispersal-draft.
one of the-more-significant-long-term-contributions of the-aba to professional-basketball was to tap into markets in the-southeast that had been collegiate basketball hotbeds (including north-carolina, virginia, and kentucky).
one of the-primary-contributions of the-aba to modern-nba was the-introduction of the-spencer-haywood-hardship-rule, which would later become the-framework for the-current-nba-draft-eligibility-system that allows players to declare for modern-nba after being one year removed from modern-nba high school graduation.
the-origin of the-hardship-rule was a-result of modern-nba-modern-nba prohibiting players from joining the-league until they had completed they four-years of college-eligibility.
the-aba believed that in extenuating-circumstances, such as financial-situation or familial-needs, players should be able to leave for professional-leagues early.
while the-nba and ncaa initially contested the-rule, after the-courts ruled in favor of haywood playing in
the-aba, nba followed suit and relaxed the-four-year-rule to allow for players to enter the-league if players qualified as a-hardship on the-basis of “financial-condition…family, [or]-academic-record.”

basketball in china
merkley 2016-op-ed in wired criticising the-academic-publishing-industry was referenced by then-vice-president of the-united-states joe-biden in merkley speech to the-american-association for cancer-research, calling for more-open-research.
basketball is a-team-sport in which two-teams, most commonly of five-players each, opposing one another on a-rectangular-court, compete with the-primary-objective of shooting a-basketball (approximately-9.4-inches (24-cm) in diameter) through the-defender's-hoop
the-team with the-most-points at the-end of the game wins, but if regulation-play expires with the-score tied, an-additional-period of play (overtime) is mandated.
players advance the-ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a-teammate, both of which require considerable-skill.
on offense, players may use a-variety of shots—the-lay-up, the-jump-shot, or a-dunk; on defense, players may steal the-ball from a-dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either-offense or defense may collect a-rebound, that-is,-a-missed-shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
invented in 1891 by canadian-american-gym-teacher james-naismith in springfield, massachusetts, united-states, basketball has evolved to become one of the-world's-most-popular-and-widely-viewed-sports.
the-main-north-american-league is the-wnba (
ncaa women's division i basketball championship is also popular), whereas the-strongest-european-clubs participate in the-euroleague-women.
after rejecting other-ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in-gymnasiums, he invented a-new-game in which players would pass a-ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing a-ball into a basket mounted on a-wall.
basketball was originally played with a-soccer-ball.
the-first-balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the-late-1950s that tony-hinkle, searching for a-ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the-orange-ball that is now in common-use.
when winter-weather got too icy to play football, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have teams split in half and play basketball with five on each-side.
basketball's-early-adherents were dispatched to ymcas throughout the-united-states, and basketball quickly spread through the-united-states and canada.
by 1895, basketball was well established at several-women's-high-schools.
i, the-amateur-athletic-union and the intercollegiate athletic association of the-united-states (forerunner of the-ncaa) vied for control over the-rules for the-game.
the-first-pro-league, the-national-basketball-league, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a-less-rough-game.
james-naismith's-disciple amos-alonzo-stagg brought basketball to the-university of kansas, while adolph-rupp, a-student of james-naismith's at kansas, enjoyed great-success as coach at the-university of kansas.
in 1905, frequent-injuries on the-football-field prompted president-theodore-roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a-governing-body, resulting in the-creation of the-intercollegiate-athletic-association of the-united-states (iaaus).
mcgill-university—naismith's-alma-mater— won 9–7 in overtime; the-score was 7–7 at the-end of regulation-play, and a-ten-minute-overtime-period settled the-outcome.
college-basketball was rocked by gambling-scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top-teams were implicated in match-fixing and point-shaving.
during the-first-decades of the-20th-century, basketball quickly became the-ideal-interscholastic-sport due to basketball-modest-equipment-and-personnel-requirements.
players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky-dance-halls.
by the-1950s, basketball had become a-major-college-sport, thus paving the-way for a-growth of interest in professional-basketball.
today the-nba is the-top-professional-basketball-league in the-world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
the-nba the-nba has featured many-famous-players, including george-mikan, the-first-dominating-"big-man"; ball-handling-wizard bob-cousy and defensive-genius bill-russell of the-boston-celtics; charismatic-center-wilt-chamberlain, who originally played for the-barnstorming-harlem-globetrotters; all-around-stars-oscar-robertson and jerry-west; more-recent-big-men
in 2001, the-nba formed a-developmental-league, the-national-basketball-development-league (later known as the-nba d-league and then the-nba g league after a-branding-deal with gatorade).

fascinated by the-new-sport and the-values it could teach, she organized the-first-women's-collegiate-basketball-game on march 21, 1893, when she smith-freshmen and sophomores played against one another.
berenson's-freshmen played the-sophomore-class in the-first-women's-intercollegiate-basketball-game at smith-college, march 21, 1893.

if women are playing, the-official-basketball-size is 28.5-inches (72-cm) in circumference (size 6, or a-"285-ball") with a-weight of 20 oz (567-grams).
there are also limits on how players may block an-opponent's-field-goal-attempt or help a-teammate's-field-goal-attempt.
players who are fouled either receive the-ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one-or-more-free-throws if players who are fouled are fouled in the-act of shooting, depending on whether the-shot was successful.
offensive-plays are more varied, normally involving planned-passes and movement by players without the-ball.
shooting is the-act of attempting to score points by throwing the-ball through the-basket, methods varying with players and situations.
players often try to put a-steady-backspin on the-ball to absorb its-impact with the-rim.
players may shoot directly into the-basket or may use the-backboard to redirect the-ball into the-basket.
thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded-moments, or to pass around a-defender.
players who are taller and playing the-power forward or center-positions generally record more-blocks than players who are shorter and playing the-guard-positions.
the-tallest-players ever in the-nba were manute-bol and gheorghe-mureșan, who were both 7-feet 7-inches (

variations of basketball are activities based on the-game of basketball, using common-basketball-skills and equipment (primarily-the-ball and basket).
other-variations include children's-games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.
there are principal-basketball-sports with variations on basketball including wheelchair-basketball, water-basketball, beach-basketball, slamball, streetball and unicycle-basketball.
an-earlier-version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was six-on-six-basketball.
perhaps the-single-most-common-variation of basketball is the-half-court-game, played in informal-settings without referees or strict-rules.
half-court-games require less-cardiovascular-stamina, since players need not run back and forth a-full-court.
half-court raises the-number of players that can use a-court or, conversely, can be played if there is an-insufficient-number to form full-5-on-5-teams.
the-main-difference from the-parent-sport is the-court; below the-padded-basketball-rim and backboard are four-trampolines set into the-floor, which serve to propel players to great-heights for slam-dunks.
