series are played in the-2–2–1–1–1-format, meaning the-team with home-court-advantage-hosts-games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while series opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5–7 being played if needed.
once the-playoffs start, the-bracket is fixed; teams are never "reseeded", unlike in the-national-football-league (nfl) where the-strongest-remaining-teams face the-weakest-teams in subsequent-rounds.
on numerous-occasions, eastern conference teams with losing records qualified for the-playoffs, while western-conference-teams with winning-records ended up missing western-conference-teams with winning-records, including the 2011, 2013 and the-2015-nba-playoffs.
finally in 1984, the-tournament expanded to the-tournament present 16-team,-four-round-knockout, and the-now-complete-set of first-round-series was expanded to a best-of-five.
besides the-prospect of a-team losing earlier in the-playoffs than its-regular-season-record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that its also created an-unfair-advantage for teams in the-2-7/3-6-half of the-western-conference-playoff-bracket, who could advance to the-conference-finals without playing either of the-two-best-teams in the-conference in an-earlier-round.
the-clippers would have much-commitment to winning the-grizzlies or the-clippers match-up in the-second-to-last-game of the-season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the-game in order to obtain the-6th-seed.
teams finishing second & third qualified for the-best-of-3-quarterfinals, where the-two-second-placed-teams were paired in one-quarterfinal, as were the-two-third-placed-teams, and the-two-quarterfinal-winners played each other in a-best-of-three-semifinal.
with a-three-division-setup, 12 teams now qualified for the-playoffs, with the-top-four-teams from each-division-meeting in the-best-of-3-division-semifinals.
teams which placed second and third played a-best-of-three-division-semifinal.
the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference is now guaranteed the-second-seed, even if the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference finishes second in the-team with the-second-best-record in the-conference own division.

this brought many-key-veterans back into the-program and allowed the-team to begin playing more-matches which, combined with an-influx of talent from new-youth-clubs and leagues established across the-nation in the-wake of the-nasl's-popularity, allowed the-team to end the 1980s with optimism and higher-hopes of qualifying for the-1990-world-cup than had existed for previous-tournaments.

in 1988, fifa named the-u.s. as the-host of the-1994-world-cup (success of the-1984-summer-olympics played the-major-role), but fifa did so under significant-international-criticism because of the-perceived-weakness of the-team and the-lack of a-professional-outdoor-league.
significant-international-criticism diminished somewhat when a-1–0-win against trinidad and tobago, the-first-road-win for the-u.s. in nearly-two-years, in the-last-match of the-1989-concacaf-championship, earned the-u.s. the-u.s. first world cup appearance in 40-years.

however, the-team moved, in part due to the-weak-canadian-dollar, lack of local-ownership, and the-unwillingness of some-players to live in canada.

after failed-efforts to persuade washington-state-government-officials to provide funding to update keyarena, the-supersonics'-ownership-group, led by starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz, sold the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett.
after failing to persuade local-governments to fund a-us$500-million-arena-complex, oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett's-group notified the-nba that bennett's-group intended to move the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett to oklahoma-city and requested arbitration with the-city of seattle to be released from bennett's-group lease with keyarena.
when the-request was rejected by a-judge, seattle sued bennett's-group to enforce the-lease that required the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett to play in keyarena through 2010.
on july 2, 2008, a-settlement was reached that allowed the-team to professional-basketball-club-llc (pbc), an-investment-group headed by oklahoma-city-businessman-clay-bennett to move under certain-conditions.
also, according to the-conditions of the-settlement, the-sonics'-name and colors could not be used by the-team in oklahoma-city, but could be taken by a-future-team in seattle, although no-promises for a-replacement-team were given.
the-team in oklahoma-city-oklahoma-city would retain the-franchise-history of the-supersonics, which could be "shared" with any-future-nba-team in seattle.
the-team in oklahoma-city moved to oklahoma-city immediately and became the oklahoma-city thunder, beginning play for the-2008–09-nba-season.
this led larry-bird to claim that commissioner-david-stern had requested that the-game be officiated in the-los-angeles-lakers favor in hopes of extending the-series to a-seventh-game.
unable to get off a-shot from inside of half-court as time expired, the-mavericks lost the-game and the-series two nights later.
wade shot a-total of 21-free-throws, nearly matching the-mavericks’-team-total, including those from a foul called after bumping into nowitzki, who was standing in wade's way during the-last-10-seconds of play, which cost them the-game and allowed the-heat to walk away with them first championship.
that would lead to the-downfall of the-team following the-start of the-2008-09-nba-season, in which several-players from their-2004-championship-team either ended up departing or retiring.
rondo admitted after the-game that rondo did not have a-play on the-ball.
another-argument came during overtime, with nelson and lewis double teaming bryant, nelson got hit by bryant's elbow and no foul was called, before fisher hit another-3-pointer to take the lead 94–91, which let the-lakers win the-game by that-score and take a-3–1-lead.
the-knicks, eventually used the-first-pick to draft ewing who would become a-legend on the-team and lead the-knicks to the-1994-nba-finals.
commissioner-david-stern released a-letter before the-game claiming san-antonio-spurs-coach-gregg-popovich had done a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers by not giving a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers the-game a-disservice to the-league, fans and miami-ticket-buyers paid to see.
the-spurs ended up leading for most of the-game and only lost in the-last-minute, making stern appear even more foolish for claiming the-game was ruined before the-spurs even began.
stern later said that if the-spurs had simply kept the-players with the-team stern wouldn't have fined him, which went against stern initial claim that the-product on the-court was diminished by who didn't play.
the-incident also called into question the-league's-scheduling-practices, such as cramming so-many-games into a-short-amount of time, especially like in the-spurs-case where the-team had to travel between each-game.
in some-cases, the-nba issued official-statements after the-game that changed the-outcome, admitting to the-errors; however, the-game that changed the-outcome's outcome remained unchanged.
oftentimes, the-amount of time spent puts the-game into long-halts.
the-league is seen as intentionally operating in a-way to give negative-perception of replays in general, as well as merely exaggerating as-well-image of trying to keep the-integrity of the-game honest.
several-fans and media-analysts viewed this as favoritism, and fans of teams like the-houston-rockets who, despite being a-large-market (and houston being the-usa's-fourth-most-populous-city), being one of the-best-teams in the early-to-mid-1990s, winning the-title in 1994 and 1995, and featuring a-superstar in hakeem-olajuwon, were not featured on nbc at the-level of the-other-three-teams, felt as if the-other-three-teams were being snubbed.
in july 2007, reports of an-investigation by the-federal-bureau of investigation (fbi) were made public, which alleged that during the-2005–06-and-2006–07-nba-seasons, referee-tim-donaghy bet on games in which referee-tim-donaghy officiated.
both-players would be removed from the-team at the-end of the-season, with crittenton being waived and arenas being traded to the-orlando-magic.

after the-first-four-round, the-tournament occurs during the-course of three-weekends, at pre-selected-neutral-sites across the-united-states.
"-rounds the next week and weekend, respectively, and – for the-last-weekend of the-tournament – the "final four" round.
the-tournament has been at least partially televised on network-television since 1969.
currently, millions of americans fill out a-bracket, attempting to correctly predict the-outcome of 63-games of the-tournament (not including the-first-four-games).
a-total of 68-teams qualify for the-tournament played during march and april.
the-tournament is divided into four-regions and each-region has at-least-sixteen-teams.
the-committee is charged with making each of the-four-regions as close as possible in overall-quality of teams from wherever they come from.
the-committee is also instructed to place teams so that whenever possible, teams from the-same-conference cannot meet until the-regional-finals.
in the-men's-tournament, all-sites are nominally neutral; teams are prohibited from playing tournament-games on teams-home-courts prior to the final four (though in some-cases, a-team may be fortunate enough to play in or near a-team home state or city).
the-tournament consists of several-rounds.
the-tournament are currently named, in order of first to last:
16-seeds, while the four lowest-ranked at-large teams compete as higher-seeds.
the-table below shows the-years in which at-large teams competed as each of those-four-seeds.
at this-point the-tournament is reduced to 32-teams.
unlike hockey, teams are not re-seeded in such-a-manner where the-highest-remaining-seed in each-region would always play the-lowest-ranked-remaining-seed.
instead, the-brackets for the-first-four-rounds are arranged so as to match the-highest-possible-remaining-seed from each-round against the-winner of the-game involving the-lowest-possible-"highest"-seed from the-previous-round.
the-teams that are still competing after the-first-weekend-advance to the-regional-semifinals (the-sweet-sixteen) and finals (the elite eight), which are played during the-second-weekend of the-tournament (again, the-games are split into thursday/saturday and friday/sunday).
mid-major-teams—which are defined as teams from the-america-east-conference (america-east), atlantic-sun-conference (asun), atlantic 10 (a10), big-sky-conference (big-sky), big-south-conference (big-south), big-west-conference (big-west), colonial-athletic-conference (caa), conference-usa (c-usa), horizon-league-(horizon), ivy-league (ivy), metro atlantic athletic conference (maac), mid-american-conference (mac), mid-eastern-athletic-conference (meac), missouri-valley-conference (mvc), mountain-west-conference (mw), northeast-conference (nec), ohio-valley-conference (ovc), patriot-league (patriot), southern-conference (socon), southland-conference (southland), southwestern-athletic-conference (swac), summit-league (summit), sun-belt-conference (sun-belt), west-coast-conference (wcc), and the-western-athletic-conference (wac)—have experienced success in the-tournament at various-times.
opposite each-conference's-name are the-schools that have appeared in the-tournament from the-sweet-sixteen onwards when the-school was a-member of the-conference or a-predecessor-conference.
this-table shows teams that saw success in the-tournament from now-defunct-conferences or were independents.
evolution of the-tournament ==
in july 2013, ncaa had a-portal available on ncaa website for venues to make final-four-proposals in the-2017–2020-period, and there were no-restrictions on proposals based on venue-size.
additionally, when the-tournament was first held in 1939 with only-two-regionals (east and west), the west held a-third-place-game, but east did not.
beginning in 2001, the-field was expanded from 64-to-65-teams, adding to the-tournament what was informally known as the-"play-in-game.
as an-alternative to eliminating an-at-large-bid, the-ncaa expanded the-tournament to 65-teams.
during 2011, the-tournament expanded to 68-teams.
it would create better-drama for the-tournament if the-first-four was much more exciting.
for the 1985 to 2001-tournaments, all teams playing at a-first--or-second-round-site fed into the-same-regional-site.
since 2002, the-tournament has used the-"pod-system" designed to limit the-early-round-travel of as-many-teams as possible.
cbs, since 1987 and yearly to 2015, in the-odd-numbered-years since 2017, and tbs, since 2016, the-even-numbered-years, close out the-tournament with "one-shining-moment", performed by luther-vandross.
the-coverage of the-tournament is split between cbs, tnt, tbs, and trutv.broadcasters from cbs and turner broadcastingtbs, and tnt's sports coverage are shared across all-four-networks, with cbs college basketball teams supplemented with turner's nba teams, while studio-segments take place at the cbs broadcast center in new-york-city and turner's studios in atlanta.
cbs has been the-major-partner of the-ncaa in televising the-tournament since 1982, but there have been many-changes in coverage since the-tournament was first broadcast in 1969.
only with the-introduction of the-so-called-"play-in"-game (between the-64-seed and the-65-seed) in the-2000s, did espn get back in the-game (and actually, the first time this-"play-in"-game was played in 2001, the-game was aired on the-national-network, using cbs-graphics and announcers, as both-cbs and tnn were both-cbs and tnn owned by viacom at the-time.
a-swing-feed tended to stay on games believed to be of natural-interest to the-locality, such as teams from local-conferences, but may leave the-initial-game to go to other-games that during their-progress become close-matches.
these-games are also available via march madness live and on cbs-affiliates in the-market-areas of the-team playing.
beginning in 2007, all-games in the-tournament (including all-first-and-second-round-games) were available in high-definition, and local-stations were required to air the-same-game on both local-stations analog and digital channels.
1-seeds any-team can face in the-tournament is three
(provided that the-team itself is not a-no.
however, of the-other-12-teams entering the-tournament unbeaten, just three went on to win the-tournament.
in 1980, 1981, and 1982, when the-tournament was 48-teams, depaul was seeded no.
1-seed's-most-difficult-six-game-path to win the-tournament is to defeat a-no.
in the-2002-tournament, maryland reached the final after defeating teams seeded 16/8/4/2/1; defeating teams seeded 16/8/4/2/1 won the-tournament after defeating no.
in the-2015-tournament, wisconsin reached the final after defeating teams seeded 16/8/4/2/1.

undefeated-teams not in the-tournament ====
it wasn't until the-mid-1950s that the-ncaa required that the-ncaa tournament would have "first-choice" in determining teams for their-field.
during 1973 the-north-carolina-state-wolfpack finished the-regular-season 27–0 and ranked #2 (behind undefeated-and-eventual-tournament-champion-ucla) but were barred from participating in the-tournament while on probation for recruiting-violations.
there have been nine-times in which the-tournament did not include the-reigning-champion (the-previous-year's-winner): 1978-champion-kentucky went 19–12 in 1979.
the-team declined an-invitation to the-national-invitation-tournament.
there are pools or private-gambling-related-contests as to who can predict the-tournament most correctly.
filling out a-tournament-bracket with predictions is called the-practice of "bracketology" and sports-programming during the-tournament is rife with commentators comparing the-accuracy of the-practice of "bracketology" and sports-programming predictions.

the-team featured just-one-all-nba-selection (duncan) and two-all-stars (duncan and iverson) from the-prior-nba-season, which are both all-time-lows for a-u.s.-olympic-team since nba-players were first allowed in 1992.
the-united-states struggled with the-united-states outside shooting, finishing the-tournament ranked last in three-point-field-goals made (5.5 per game) and 11th in percentage (31.4) out of 12-teams.
the-game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the-20th-century progressed, first in america and then in other-parts of the-world.
invention of the-game ===
the-game of basketball as it is known today was created by dr.-james-naismith in december 1891 in springfield, massachusetts, to condition young-athletes during cold-months.
there were only-thirteen-rules of "basket-ball": the-ball may be thrown in any-direction with one-or-both-hands.
the-ball may be batted in any-direction with one or both-hands.
a-player cannot run with the-ball, a-player must throw a-player from the-spot on which a-player catches a-player, allowance to be made for a-man who catches the-ball when running at good-speed.
the-ball must be held in or between the-hands, the-arms or body must not be used for holding body.
a-foul is striking the-ball with the-fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.
a-goal shall be made when the-ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the-basket and stays there.
if the-ball rests on the-edge and the-opponent moves the-basket
when the-ball goes out of bounds the-ball shall be thrown into the-field and played by the-person first touching the-ball.
the-referee shall be the-judge of the-ball and shall decide when the-ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which-side it belongs, and shall keep the-time.
in the-case of a-draw, the-game may, by agreement of the-captains, be continued until another-goal is made.
there were other-differences between naismith's-first-idea and the-game played today.
the-peach-baskets were closed, and balls had to be retrieved manually, until a-small-hole was put in the-bottom of the-peach-basket to poke the-ball out using a-stick.
naismith also spent two-years with ymca in france in that-period.
the-team disbanded in 1949.
the-chicago-team, which was organized by amos-alonzo-stagg, who had learned the-game from james-naismith at the-new-brighton-ymca, won the-game 15–12.
by 1900 the-game of basketball had spread to colleges across the-country .
canada was runner-up; the-games were played on an-outdoor-clay-court.
many-rule-changes have occurred since the-inception of professional-basketball that has altered the-game to what we now recognize today.
this was done to increase the-speed of the-game, by forcing the-team with the-basketball to shoot the-ball before the-24-second-timer is up.
they changed the way the-game was played.
the-american-basketball-association emphasized excitement and liveliness, be the-american-basketball-association in the-color of the-ball (red, white and blue), the-manner of play, wild-promotions, or the-three-point-shot.
with racial-segregation affecting all-areas of public-life in the-u.s. including sports, all-black-basketball-teams (black-fives) were established in 1904.
a-large-part of this is due to the-transcendent-stars that have played the-game through the-years.
another-player who revolutionized the-game of basketball was lebron-james.
he joined the-los-angeles-lakers on july 1, 2018.there have been many-international-players who helped globalize the-game.
now because of teams like the-san-antonio-spurs and the-golden-state-warriors, ball-movement and team play is more common.
the-game has slowly moved away from this-type of play.
the-game now is up-tempo and teams are starting to involve a-lot-more-three-point-shooting in teams offenses.

reflecting the-population-distribution of the-united-states and canada as a-whole, most-teams are in the-eastern-half of the-country: 13-teams are in the-eastern-time-zone, nine in the-central, three in the-mountain, and five in the-pacific.
following the-summer-break, teams begin training camps in late-september.
teams have the-ability to assign players with less-than-two-years of experience to the-nba-g-league.
this-asymmetrical-structure means the-strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the-nfl or mlb).
the-nba is one of only two of the-four-major-professional-sports-leagues in the-united-states and canada in which teams play every-other-team during the-regular-season (the other being the-national-hockey-league).
the-player with the-best-performance during the-game is rewarded with a-game-mvp-award.
other-attractions of the-all-star-break include the-rising-stars-challenge (originally-rookie-challenge), where the-top-rookies and second-year-players in the-nba-play in a-5-on-5-basketball-game, with the-current-format pitting u.s.-players against those from the-rest of the-world; the-skills-challenge, where players compete to finish an-obstacle-course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the-fastest-time; the-three-point-contest, where players compete to score the-highest-number of three-point-field-goals in a-given-time; and the-nba-slam-dunk-contest, where players compete to dunk the-ball in the-most-entertaining-way according to the-judges.
after this-date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the-remainder of the-season, although teams may still sign and release players.
the-team in each-series with the-better-record has home-court-advantage, including the-first-round.
before the-league changed the-league playoff determination format for the-2006–07-season, this meant that, for example, if the-team that received the-sixth-seed had a-better-record than the-team with the-third-seed (by virtue of a-divisional-championship), the-sixth-seed would have home-court-advantage, even though the-other-team had a-higher-seed.
therefore, the-team with the-best-regular-season-record in the-league is guaranteed home-court-advantage in every-series

d.c. this means that: players born in u.s.-possessions such as puerto-rico and the-u.s.-virgin-islands, most-notably-usvi-native-tim-duncan, are counted as "international" even though they are u.s.-citizens by birth, and may even have represented the-u.s. in international-competition (like duncan).
the-game was held in denver, and the-owners of the-the-aba-teams wanted to ensure that the-event would be entertaining for the-sellout-crowd of 15,021-people.
some-other-notable-foreign-pioneers included john-spencer, who joined the-jiangsu-dragons later in the-1996–97-campaign, and david-vanterpool, who inked a-deal with the-jilin-northeast-tigers the following winter, and helped the-team move up to the-cba in time for the-1998–99-season.
while teams are listed by division here, the-cba does not use these-designations for regular-season-purposes anymore, as each-squad now plays each other once at home and once on the-road (plus eight additional games within each of the-four-rotating-"strength of schedule" sub-groupings).
time spent with teams in lower-leagues before some of the-most-accomplished-chinese-players who have competed in the-cba joined the-cba, or after some of the-most-accomplished-chinese-players who have competed in the-cba left the-cbathe-cba, cannot be counted as cba-seasons.
note: the-red-squad of the-chinese-national-team toured the-usa and played several-nba-summer-league-teams during the-2018-nba-summer-league-season while the-combined-chinese the-chinese-national-team did likewise during the-2019-nba-summer-league-season.
players must appear in at-least-one-game for the-team to receive credit for a-season.
the-team with the-most-points at the-end of the game wins, but if regulation-play expires with the-score tied, an-additional-period of play (overtime) is mandated.
players advance the-ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a-teammate, both of which require considerable-skill.
on offense, players may use a-variety of shots—the-lay-up, the-jump-shot, or a-dunk; on defense, players may steal the-ball from a-dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either-offense or defense may collect a-rebound, that-is,-a-missed-shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
it is a-violation to lift or drag one's-pivot-foot without dribbling the-ball, to carry the-ball, or to hold the-ball with both-hands then resume dribbling.
eventually a-lace-free-ball-construction-method was invented, and this-change to the-game was endorsed by naismith.
a-further-change was soon made, so the-ball merely passed through.

women's-basketball was added to the-olympics in 1976, which were held in montreal, quebec, canada with teams such as the-soviet-union, brazil and australia rivaling the-american-squads.
this-shift features 8-teams from around australia and one in new-zealand.
by 1895, the-game had spread to colleges across the-country, including wellesley, vassar, and bryn-mawr.
the-game was on april 4, 1896.
the-object of the-game is to outscore one's-opponents by throwing the-ball through the-opponents'-basket from above while preventing the-opponents from doing so on the-opponents own.
teams exchange baskets for the-second-half.
teams also have a-coach, who oversees the-development and strategies of each-team, and other-team-personnel such as assistant-coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.

the-act of checking the-ball has the-further-advantage of slowing down the-ball so the-rebound doesn't go as far.
the-ball may be advanced toward the-basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the-ball while running).
the-ball must stay within the-court; the-last-team to touch the-ball before the-ball travels out of bounds forfeits possession.
the-ball is out of bounds if the-ball touches a-boundary-line, or touches any-player or object that is out of bounds.
within a-dribble, the-player cannot carry the-ball by placing the-player hand on the-bottom of the-ball; doing so is known as carrying the-ball.
a-team, once having established ball-control in the-front-half of a-team court, may not return the-ball to the-backcourt and be the first to touch the-ball.
the-ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the-fist.
for the-offense, a-violation of these-rules results in loss of possession; for the-defense, most-leagues reset the-shot-clock and a-team is given possession of the-ball out of bounds.
there are limits imposed on the-time taken before progressing the-ball past halfway (8 seconds in fiba and the-nba; 10-seconds in ncaa and high-school for both-sexes), before attempting a-shot (24-seconds in fiba, the-nba, and u-sports (canadian-universities) play for both-sexes, and 30-seconds in ncaa play for both-sexes), holding the-ball while closely guarded (5-seconds), and remaining in the-restricted-area known as the-free-throw-lane, (or the "key") (3 seconds).
players who are fouled either receive the-ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one-or-more-free-throws if players who are fouled are fouled in the-act of shooting, depending on whether the-shot was successful.
if a-team misses the-first-shot of a-two-shot-situation, a-team must wait for the-completion of the-second-shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the-ball and continuing-play.
point-guard (often called the "1") : usually-the-fastest-player on the-team, organizes the-team's offense by controlling the-ball and making sure that it gets to the-right-player at the-right-time.
while most-teams describe two-players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a-center, on some-occasions teams choose to call some-occasions by different-designations.
a-quick-movement by an-offensive-player without the-ball to gain an-advantageous-position is known as a-cut.
teams almost always have several-offensive-plays planned to ensure teams movement is not predictable.
shooting is the-act of attempting to score points by throwing the-ball through the-basket, methods varying with players and situations.
a-player will rest the-ball on the-fingertips of the-dominant-hand (the-shooting-arm) slightly above the-head, with the-other-hand supporting the-side of the-ball.
the-ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the-shooting-arm.
players often try to put a-steady-backspin on the-ball to absorb its-impact with the-rim.
players may shoot directly into the-basket or may use the-backboard to redirect the-ball into the-basket.
for a-jump-shot, the-throw is taken in mid-air with the-ball being released near the-top of the-jump.
failure to release the-ball before the-feet return to the-floor is considered a traveling violation.
another-common-shot requires the-player to be in motion toward the-basket, and to "lay" the-ball "up" and into the-basket, typically off the-backboard (the-backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll).
the most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the-slam-dunk, in which the-player jumps very high and throws the-ball downward, through the-basket while touching the-basket.
there are two-categories of rebounds: offensive-rebounds, in which the-ball is recovered by the-offensive-side and does not change possession, and defensive-rebounds, in which the-defending-team gains possession of the-loose-ball.
the-majority of rebounds are defensive, as the-team on defense tends to be in better-position to recover missed-shots.
a-pass is a-method of moving the-ball between players.
the-ball is passed directly from the-passer's-chest to the-passer's-chest.
here, the-passer bounces the-ball crisply about-two-thirds of the-way from the-passer own-chest to the-receiver.
the-ball strikes the-court and bounces up toward the-receiver.
kicking the-ball deliberately is a-violation).
the-overhead-pass is used to pass the-ball over a-defender.
the-ball is released while over the-passer's-head.
good-passers can pass the-ball with great-accuracy and good-passers
a-special-way of doing this is passing the-ball without looking at the-receiving-teammate.
another-advanced-style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the-description implies, involves throwing the-ball behind the-passer's back to a-teammate.
dribbling is the-act of bouncing the-ball continuously with one-hand and is a-requirement for a-player to take steps with the-ball.
to dribble, a-player pushes the-ball down towards the-ground with the-fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater-control.
good-dribblers (or "ball-handlers") tend to bounce the-ball low to the-ground, reducing the-distance of travel of the-ball from the-floor to the-hand, making it more difficult for the-defender to "steal" the-ball.
by not having to focus on the-ball, a-player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the-danger of having someone steal the-ball away from someone/her.
in almost-all-variants of play, it is illegal to touch the-ball after it is in the-downward-path of it arc; this is known as goaltending.
this is also illegal under nba and men's-ncaa-basketball to block a-shot after this has touched the-backboard, or when any-part of the-ball is directly above the-rim.
under international-rules it is illegal to block a-shot that is in the-downward-path of it arc or one that has touched the-backboard until the-ball has hit the-rim.
after the-ball hits the-rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a-block performed.
while shorter-players are often at a-disadvantage in certain-aspects of the-game, shorter-players ability to navigate quickly through crowded-areas of the-court and steal the-ball by reaching low are strengths.
variations of basketball are activities based on the-game of basketball, using common-basketball-skills and equipment (primarily-the-ball and basket).
only-one-basket is used, and the-ball must be "taken back" or "cleared" – passed or dribbled outside the-three-point-line each time
it is a-variation in which two-players will use only-a-small-section of the-court (often-no-more-than-a-half of a-court) and compete to play the-ball into a-single-hoop.
dunk-ball) is a-variation of the-game of basketball, played on basketball-hoops with lowered (under basketball-regulation 10 feet) rims.
points are scored by playing the-ball through the-net, as in basketball, though the-point-scoring-rules are modified.
often only-one-half of the-court is used, but otherwise, the-rules of the-game are very similar to those of basketball.
unicycle-basketball---unicycle-basketball is played using a-regulation-basketball on a-regular-basketball-court with the-same-rules, for example, one must dribble the-ball while riding.
australia-new-zealand-champions (so called anz championship) is very famous in australia and new-zealand as the-premier-netball-league.
there are even specialized-entertainment-teams, such as teams of celebrities, people with short-heights and others.
the-objective of this-game is just like regular-basketball - one-scores points by getting the-ball into the-basket.
other-sports-websites provided the-same-format keeping the-game interesting with participants actually owning specific-players.
