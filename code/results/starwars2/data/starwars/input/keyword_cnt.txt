174	however,	1	rose	3	could	1	also	1	be	1	rebellious,	1	and	2	was	1	willing	1	to	4	disobey	1	orders	1	do	1	what	1	thinks	1	is	1	right,	1	as	1	shown	1	by	1	willingness	1	work	1	with	1	finn	1	poe	1	on	1	a-secret-plan	1	help	1	the-resistance	1	in	1	the-last-jedi.	1
175	rose	4	was	2	very	1	close	1	with	1	family,	1	and	3	a-strong-sense	1	of	1	right	1	wrong	1	instilled	1	in	1	by	1	late-parents	1	paige.	1
176	rose	1	particularly	1	looked	1	up	1	to	2	paige,	1	and	2	the	2	two	2	had	2	an-extremely-strong-emotional-connection;	1	according	1	the-cobalt-squadron-novel,	1	never	1	been	2	apart	1	for	1	more-than-a-couple	2	of	2	days,	1	days	1	shared	1	"a-bond	1	that	1	would	1	have	1	extraordinary	1	even	1	between	1	twins".	1
177	prior	1	to	1	the-events	1	of	1	the-last-jedi,	1	rose	2	was	1	more	1	shy	1	and	2	self-conscious,	1	but	1	paige	2	had	1	faith	1	in	1	rose's	1	abilities	1	encouraged	1	even	1	when	1	herself	1	lacked	1	confidence.	1
178	this	1	was	1	particularly	1	illustrated	1	in	1	the-"rose-&-paige"-issue	1	of	2	the-star-wars:	1	forces	1	destiny	1	comic	1	book,	1	during	1	which	1	rose	1	hesitated	1	to	2	share	1	an-idea	1	with	1	general-leia-organa	1	until	1	paige	2	pushed	1	do	1	so.	1
179	in	2	writing	1	about	1	rose's-past	1	forces	1	of	1	destiny	1	and	1	the-star-wars-adventures-comic-books,	1	writer-delilah-s.-dawson	2	said	1	believed	1	the-example	1	paige	1	set	1	for	1	rose	1	"	1
180	when	1	paige	4	died,	1	rose	2	felt	1	a-void	1	in	1	own	1	identity,	1	according	1	to	1	tran,	1	but	1	ultimately	1	paige's	1	love	1	for	1	helped	1	become	1	more	1	confident	1	and	1	carry	1	on	1	after	1	sister	1	was	1	gone.	1
181	paige's-death	1	also	1	drove	1	rose	1	that	1	much	1	harder	1	to	1	fight	1	against	1	the-first-order,	1	so	1	her-sister's-death	1	would	1	not	1	be	1	in	1	vain.	1
182	rose's-rage	1	toward	1	the-first-order	1	was	1	informed	1	not	1	only	1	by	1	paige's-death,	1	but	1	also	1	because	1	paige	2	personally	1	witnessed	1	the-brutality	1	and	1	devastation	1	it	1	unleashed	1	on	1	home	1	planet	1	of	1	hays-minor.	1
183	as	1	a-result,	1	her-dedication	1	to	2	the-resistance	1	was	1	not	1	tied	1	a-noble,-abstract-idea	1	of	4	heroism,	1	but	1	a-firsthand-knowledge	1	the-threat	1	they	1	are	1	fighting,	1	which	1	gave	1	her	1	a-deeper-understanding	1	the-war	1	than	1	even	1	some	1	the-soldiers	1	around	1	her.	1
184	rose's-feelings	1	occasionally	1	manifested	1	in	1	anger,	1	such	1	as	1	her-reaction	1	when	2	her	4	discovered	1	finn	1	attempting	1	to	1	flee	1	the-raddus,	1	or	1	said	1	of	1	canto-bight	1	that	1	wished	1	could	1	"put	1	(her)	1
185	however,	1	rose	1	was	1	also	1	very	1	empathetic,	1	as	1	demonstrated	1	by	1	the-kindness	1	her	2	showed	1	the-children	1	on	1	canto-bight,	1	and	1	the	1	way	1	rescued	1	finn	1	at	1	the-end	1	of	1	the-last-jedi.	1
186	rose	1	also	1	served	1	the-role	1	of	1	everywoman	1	in	1	the-last-jedi.	1
187	both-johnson	1	and	1	tran	1	have	1	described	1	rose	1	as	1	an-unlikely-hero	1	who	1	preferred	1	to	1	work	1	in	2	the-background,	1	but	1	was	1	pulled	1	into	1	a-prominent-position	1	the-conflict	1	by	1	the-circumstances	1	around	1	rose.	1
188	rose	2	was	1	a-very-low-ranking-member	1	of	1	the-resistance,	1	and	3	demonstrated	1	that	1	every-position	2	matters	2	anyone,	1	no	1	matter	1	anyone	1	status	1	or	1	position,	1	can	1	make	1	a-difference.	1
189	rose	1	also	1	illustrated	1	how	1	war	1	affects	1	the-average-person.	1
190	despite	1	her-talents	1	and	1	abilities,	1	rose	1	did	1	not	1	consider	1	her	2	a	1	hero,	1	nor	1	was	1	seeking	1	to	1	become	1	one.	1
191	tran	1	said	1	of	1	the-character:	1	"it's	1	such-a-huge-deal	1	to	1	tran,	1	the-idea	1	that	2	her's	1	not	1	necessarily	1	special	2	in	3	the-way	1	we	1	have	1	defined	1	before	1	other-movies,	1	or	1	other-stories.	1	"	1
192	rose	2	has	1	also	1	been	1	described	1	as	1	the-personification	1	of	3	real-life-star-wars-fandom,	1	with	1	tran	1	her	1	saying:	1	"i	1	definitely	1	believe	1	that	1	embodies	1	the-idea	1	a-fan	1	being	1	pulled	1	into	1	something	1	that’s	1	kind	1	crazy.	1
193	this	1	was	1	particularly	1	illustrated	1	in	1	rose's-excitement	1	about	1	meeting	1	finn	1	for	1	the-first-time,	1	during	1	which	1	her-trips	1	over	1	her-words,	1	excitedly	1	calling	1	him	1	"the	1	finn",	1	and	1	nervously	1	said	1	"doing	1	talking-[sic]	1	with	1	resistance-heroes	1	isn't	1	really	1	my	1	forte".	1
194	rose-tico	1	was	1	created	1	by	1	rian-johnson	1	for	1	the-film	1	star-wars:	1
195	the-last-jedi	1	(2017),	1	which	1	rian-johnson	1	wrote	1	and	1	directed.	1
196	while	1	working	1	on	2	the-script,	1	rian-johnson	2	originally	1	had	1	the-characters	1	poe-dameron	1	and	1	finn	2	go	1	to	1	canto-bight	1	together,	1	but	1	decided	1	having	1	a-female-character	1	accompany	1	would	1	make	1	for	1	a	1	more	1	interesting	1	dynamic	1	because	1	otherwise,	1	"it	1	was	1	just-these-two-dudes	1	an-adventure".	1
197	rian-johnson	1	said	1	in	1	the-original-versions	1	of	1	the-script	1	with	1	poe	3	and	4	finn	2	together,	1	dialogue	1	could	1	have	1	been	1	interchangeable	1	there	1	was	1	no-conflict	1	between	1	finn.	1
198	this	1	led	1	rian-johnson	3	to	1	conceive	1	the-rose-tico-character,	1	who,	1	in	1	rian-johnson's	1	words,	1	could	1	"actually	1	challenge	1	[finn]	1	and	2	push	1	contrast	1	with	1	was	1	where	1	rose	1	came	1
199	details	1	about	1	the-character	1	were	1	first	1	discussed	1	at	1	the-star-wars-celebration-convention	1	in	1	orlando,	1	florida,	1	on	1	april	1	14,	1	2017.	1
200	johnson	1	described	1	rose-tico	1	as	1	the-"biggest-new-part	1	in	2	the-movie",	1	and	1	the-character	1	introduced	1	the-film.	1
201	rose	1	has	1	the-most-screen-time	1	of	1	any-new-character	1	introduced	1	in	1	the-last-jedi.	1
202	the-name	1	rose	1	was	1	originally	1	used	1	for	1	the-character	1	maz-kanata	1	during	1	the-pre-production	1	of	1	star-wars:	1
203	the-force	1	awakens.	1
204	the-name	1	rose	2	is	1	a-tribute	1	to	1	gilbert,	1	the-late-high-school-english-teacher	1	who	1	instructed	1	both	1	the	1
205	a-handful	1	of	1	scenes	1	involving	1	rose	1	in	2	the	1	original	1	the-last-jedi-scripts	1	were	1	either	1	eliminated	1	or	1	revised	1	later-drafts.	1
206	for	1	example,	1	in	1	the-original-script,	1	finn	2	was	1	a-gunner	1	along	1	with	1	paige	3	during	1	bombing	1	run,	1	and	1	witnessed	1	death.	1
207	additionally,	1	the-master-codebreaker-rose	1	and	2	finn	2	sought	1	was	1	originally	1	planned	1	to	2	be	1	an-insectoid-warlord	1	who	1	involved	1	rose	1	in	1	an-effort	1	rob	1	a-rival.	1
208	this	1	led	1	to	1	an-extended-sequence	1	of	1	finn,	1	rose,	1	and	2	the-codebreaker's-crew	1	climbing	1	atop	1	the-casino-rooftop	1	during	1	an-attempted-robbery,	1	which	1	ended	1	with	1	finn	1	rose	1	getting	1	arrested.	1
209	kelly-marie-tran	4	believed	1	that	1	ultimately	1	helped	1	in	1	audition,	1	because	1	didn't	1	have	1	pre-established-expectations	1	or	1	attempt	1	to	1	model	1	rose	1	on	1	characters	1	from	1	the-previous-films.	1
210	nevertheless,	1	tran	2	wore	1	the-tie	1	again	1	during	1	first	1	callback.	1
211	tran	1	went	1	through	1	five-intense-rounds	1	of	2	auditions	1	over	1	five-months	1	between	2	the-summer	1	and	1	fall	1	2015,	1	with	1	one-month	1	spanning	1	each-audition.	1
212	johnson	4	observed	1	tran	3	during	2	second	1	audition,	1	and	1	immediately	1	liked	1	tran;	1	said	1	watching	1	felt	1	like	1	seeing	1	the-character	1	pictured	1	in	1	mind	1	the-writing-process.	1
213	during	1	one	1	of	1	the-auditions,	1	tran	1	did	1	one-on-one	1	reads	1	alongside	1	john-boyega,	1	the-actor	1	who	1	portrays	1	finn,	1	to	1	determine	1	whether	1	the-two-actors	1	had	1	chemistry	1	and	1	worked	1	well	1	together.	1
214	boyega	2	said	1	was	2	clear	1	from	1	the-start	1	of	1	their-readings	1	together	1	that	1	tran	1	the-best-actress	1	for	1	the-part.	1
215	the-final-audition	1	took	1	place	1	in	1	london	1	with	1	full-hair,	1	makeup,	1	and	1	costuming.	1
216	three	1	weeks	1	later,	1	in	1	november	1	2015,	1	johnson	1	met	1	with	1	tran	2	and	1	offered	1	the-role.	1
217	johnson	2	said	1	tran	2	had	1	an-oddball-nature	1	and	2	genuine-sweetness	1	to	2	tran,	1	knew	1	audiences	1	would	1	want	1	character	1	succeed.	1
218	boyega	1	felt	1	tran's-background	1	in	1	improv-comedy	1	and	1	numerous-internet-videos	1	ultimately	1	helped	1	tran	1	bring	1	to	1	the-role	1	a-light-tone	1	necessary	1	for	1	the-last-jedi,	1	despite	1	the-seriousness	1	of	1	the-narrative.	1
219	the-casting	1	of	1	tran	1	was	1	first	1	announced	1	on	2	the-official-star-wars-website	1	february	1	15,	1	2016,	1	which	1	described	1	the-actress	1	as	1	a-"talented-newcomer".	1
220	tran	3	discussed	1	the-character	1	for	1	the-first-time	1	publicly	1	at	1	the-star-wars-celebration-convention	1	in	2	orlando,	1	where	1	said:	1	"tran's	1	part	1	of	1	the-resistance,	1	and	1	works	1	maintenance.	1
221	in	1	later-interviews,	1	tran	2	said	1	hopes	1	the-character	1	will	1	show	1	viewers	1	that	1	"even	1	if	2	you	3	are	2	not	1	born	1	a-princess	1	or	1	into	1	a-position	1	of	1	privilege,	1	a-background-player	1	and	1	aren't	1	a-frontrunner	1	like	1	a-star-pilot,	1	can	1	still	1	make	1	a-difference".	1
222	the-last-jedi	1	was	1	tran's-first-film-role.	1
223	a-vietnamese-american	4	said	1	believes	1	it	2	was	1	important	2	to	2	have	1	a-strong-female-asian-american-character	1	in	2	star-wars	1	because	1	knows	1	from	1	own	1	childhood	1	how	1	is	1	for	1	young-people	2	see	1	characters	1	like	1	represented	1	film,	1	television,	1	and	1	books.	1
224	that	1	means	1	a-lot	1	to	1	tran	1

226	in	1	may	1	2017,	1	tran	1	posed	1	as	1	rose	1	on	2	the-cover	1	of	1	vanity-fair,	1	becoming	1	the-first-asian-american-cover	1	to	1	appear	1	the-magazine's-cover.	1
227	in	2	december	1	2017,	1	disney	1	arranged	1	for	1	tran	2	to	2	embark	1	on	1	a-press-tour	1	singapore	1	and	1	parents’	1	home	1	country	1	of	1	vietnam	1	publicize	1	the-last-jedi.	1
228	the-costume-design	1	for	2	rose-tico	1	was	2	being	1	developed	1	the-last-jedi	1	before	1	the-actress	1	cast.	1
229	the-original-script	1	called	1	for	1	rose	1	to	1	wear	1	a-beautiful-gown	1	during	1	the-canto-bight-scenes,	1	so	1	the-crew	1	would	1	blend	1	in	1	with	1	the-other-wealthy-clientele.	1
230	this-idea	2	was	2	ultimately	1	abandoned,	1	and	2	decided	1	that	1	rose	2	would	1	wear	1	the-coverall-costume	1	throughout	1	the-entire-canto-bight-subplot,	1	which	1	had	1	the-effect	1	of	1	making	1	finn	1
231	rose	1	is	1	a-no-nonsense-character.	1

234	the-original-script	1	called	1	for	1	the-medallions	1	worn	1	by	1	rose	1	and	1	paige	1	to	2	be	2	a-two-part-pendant	1	that	1	could	1	placed	1	together	1	form	1	a-single-image.	1
235	this	1	was	1	later	1	changed	1	so	1	that	1	both-rose	1	and	3	paige	2	had	1	identical-medallions,	1	but	1	concept-artist-matthew-savage	1	said	1	rose	2	still	1	have	1	a-yin-and-yang-quality	1	about	1	paige.	1
236	in	1	january	1	2016,	1	tran	1	moved	1	to	2	london	1	begin	1	filming.	1
237	tran	3	was	2	bound	1	by	1	confidentiality-agreements	1	not	2	to	1	discuss	1	the-character	1	and	1	could	1	tell	1	anyone	1	that	1	working	1	on	1	a-star-wars-film,	1	even	1	own	1	family.	1

240	on	2	her-first-day	1	the-last-jedi-set,	1	tran	1	saw	1	anthony-daniels	1	performing	1	as	1	c-3po	1	and	1	hugged	1	him,	1	which	1	her	1	called	1	"the	1	best	1	experience	1	ever".	1
241	tran	1	said:	1	"you	1	have	1	to	2	find	1	a-way	1	just	1	do	1	the-work	1	and	1	kind	1	of	1	block	1	everything	1	(else)	1	out.	1

244	tran	3	shared	1	more-scenes	1	with	2	john-boyega	1	than	1	any-other-cast-member,	1	and	2	said	1	it	1	was	1	very	1	easy	1	to	1	work	1	tran,	1	that	1	learned	1	a-lot	1	from	1	tran.	1
245	tran	1	said	1	of	1	john-boyega:	1	"john	1	is	1	someone	1	who	1	i	2	feel	1	like	1	immediately	1	was	1	able	1	to	1	mesh	1	with.	1

735	picking	1	up	1	directly	1	where	1	the-previous-installment	1	left	1	off,	1	rey	2	presents	1	luke	2	with	1	lightsaber,	1	but	1	dismissively	1	throws	1	his-lightsaber	1	aside.	1
736	luke	1	eventually	1	agrees	1	to	1	teach	1	rey	1	the-ways	1	of	1	the-force.	1
737	rey	1	demonstrates	1	immense-raw-strength	1	and	2	a-clear-temptation	1	toward	1	the-dark-side	1	of	2	the-force	1	that	1	reminds	1	luke	1	kylo-ren,	1	who	1	was	1	once	1	his-nephew	1	student,	1	ben-solo.	1
738	all	1	the	1	while,	1	rey	1	feels	1	a-sudden-connection	1	through	1	the-force	1	with	1	ren,	1	who	1	tells	2	her	2	that	2	luke	5	tried	1	to	2	kill	2	while	1	was	2	the-jedi-master’s-student	1	(luke	1	later	1	tempted	1	ben	1	after	1	seeing	1	a-vision	1	of	1	the-pain	1	and	1	suffering	1	would	1	cause,	1	but	1	relented).	1

1321	the-solar-system	1	is	1	located	1	in	1	the-milky-way,	1	a-barred-spiral-galaxy	1	with	1	a-diameter	1	of	1	about-100,000-light-years	1	containing	1	more-than-100-billion-stars.	1
1322	the-sun	1	resides	1	in	1	one	1	of	1	the-milky-way's-outer-spiral-arms,	1	known	1	as	1	the-orion–cygnus-arm	1	or	1	local-spur.	1
1323	the-sun	3	lies	1	about-26,660-light-years	1	from	1	the-galactic-centre,	1	and	1	speed	1	around	1	the-center	1	of	1	the-milky-way	1	is	1	about-247-km/s,	1	so	1	that	1	completes	1	one-revolution	1	every	1	210	1	million	1	years.	1

2466	in	1	march	1	2021,	1	nasa	1	reported,	1	based	1	on	2	measurements	1	of	5	over-500-marsquakes	1	by	1	the-insight-lander	1	mars,	1	that	1	the-core	2	mars	1	is	1	between-1,810-and-1,860-km	1	(1,120	1	and	2	1,160-mi),	1	about-half-the-size	1	earth,	1	significantly	1	smaller	1	—	2	suggesting	1	a-core	1	lighter-elements	1	than	1	thought	1	earlier.	1
2467	although	1	mars	2	has	1	no-evidence	1	of	3	a-structured-global-magnetic-field,	1	observations	1	show	1	that	2	parts	1	the-planet's-crust	1	have	2	been	1	magnetized,	1	suggesting	1	alternating	1	polarity-reversals	1	dipole	1	field	1	occurred	1	in	1	the-past.	1
2468	one-theory,	1	published	1	in	2	1999	1	and	2	re-examined	1	october	1	2005	1	(with	1	the-help	1	of	1	the-mars-global-surveyor),	1	is	1	that	1	these-bands	1	suggest	1	plate-tectonic-activity	1	on	1	mars	1	four	1	billion	1	years	1	ago,	1	before	1	the-planetary-dynamo	1	ceased	1	to	1	function	1	the-planet's-magnetic-field	1	faded.	1
2469	it	1	is	1	thought	1	that,	1	during	1	the-solar-system's-formation,	1	mars	1	was	1	created	1	as	1	the-result	1	of	3	a-stochastic-process	1	run-away-accretion	1	material	1	from	1	the-protoplanetary-disk	1	that	1	orbited	1	the-sun.	1
2470	mars	2	has	1	many-distinctive-chemical-features	1	caused	1	by	1	position	1	in	1	the-solar-system.	1
2471	about-60%	1	of	5	the-surface	2	mars	2	shows	1	a-record	1	impacts	1	from	1	that-era,	1	whereas	1	much	1	is	1	probably	1	underlain	1	by	2	immense-impact-basins	1	caused	1	those-events.	1
2472	this-theory	1	suggests	1	that	1	mars	1	was	1	struck	1	by	1	a-pluto-sized-body	1	about	1	four	1	billion	1	years	1	ago.	1
2473	the-geological-history	1	of	1	mars	1	can	1	be	1	split	1	into	1	many-periods,	1	but	1	the-following	1	are	1	the-three-primary-periods:	1
2474	geological-activity	1	is	1	still	1	taking	1	place	1	on	1	mars.	1
2475	this	1	is	1	a-very-high-concentration	1	and	3	makes	1	the-martian-soil	1	toxic	1	(see	1	also	1	martian-soil-toxicity).streaks	1	are	1	common	1	across	1	mars	1	new-ones	1	appear	1	frequently	1	on	1	steep-slopes	1	of	1	craters,	1	troughs,	1	valleys.	1
2476	liquid-water	1	cannot	1	exist	1	on	1	the-surface	1	of	2	mars	1	due	1	to	1	low-atmospheric-pressure,	1	which	1	is	1	less-than-1%	1	that	1	earth's,	1	except	1	at	1	the-lowest-elevations	1	for	1	short-periods.	1
2477	the-volume	1	of	3	water-ice	1	in	1	the-south-polar-ice-cap,	1	if	1	melted,	1	would	1	be	1	sufficient	1	to	2	cover	1	the-surface	1	mars	1	a-depth	1	11-metres	1	(36-ft).	1
2478	landforms	1	visible	1	on	2	mars	1	strongly	1	suggest	1	that	1	liquid-water	1	has	1	existed	1	the-planet's-surface.	1
2479	further-evidence	1	that	1	liquid-water	1	once	1	existed	1	on	1	the-surface	1	of	4	mars	1	comes	1	from	1	the-detection	1	specific-minerals	1	such	1	as	1	hematite	1	and	1	goethite,	1	both	1	which	1	sometimes	1	form	1	in	1	the-presence	1	water.	1

2481	it	1	is	3	estimated	1	that	2	the-amount	1	of	8	water	1	in	1	the-upper-mantle	1	mars,	1	represented	1	by	1	hydroxyl-ions	1	contained	1	within	1	the-minerals	1	mars's	1	geology,	1	equal	1	to	3	or	1	greater	1	than	1	earth	1	at	3	50–300-parts	1	per	1	million	1	water,	1	which	1	enough	1	cover	1	the-entire-planet	1	a-depth	1	200–1,000-metres	1	(660–3,280	1	ft).in	1	2005,	1	radar-data	1	revealed	1	the-presence	1	large-quantities	1	water-ice	1	the-poles	1	and	1	mid-latitudes.	1
2482	in	1	september	1	2015,	1	nasa	1	announced	1	that	1	they	1	had	1	found	1	conclusive-evidence	1	of	3	hydrated	1	brine	1	flows	1	on	2	recurring-slope-lineae,	1	based	1	spectrometer-readings	1	the-darkened-areas	1	slopes.	1
2483	researchers	1	suspect	1	that	1	much	1	of	3	the-low-northern-plains	1	the-planet	1	were	1	covered	1	with	1	an-ocean	1	hundreds	1	meters	1	deep,	1	though	1	this	1	remains	1	controversial.	1
2484	other-scientists	1	caution	1	that	3	results	1	from	1	the-curiosity-rover	1	have	2	not	2	been	1	confirmed,	1	and	1	point	1	out	1	martian-climate-models	1	yet	1	shown	1	the-planet	1	was	1	warm	1	enough	1	in	1	the-past	1	to	1	support	1	bodies	1	of	1	liquid-water.	1

2487	today,	1	features	1	on	1	mars	1	are	1	named	1	from	1	a-variety	1	of	1	sources.	1
2488	the-surface	1	of	2	mars	1	as	1	seen	1	from	1	earth	1	is	1	divided	1	into	1	two-kinds	1	areas,	1	with	1	differing-albedo.	1
2489	the-largest-dark-feature	1	seen	1	from	1	earth	1	is	1	syrtis-major-planum.	1
2490	mars's-equator	3	is	1	defined	1	by	2	rotation,	1	but	1	the-location	1	of	3	prime	1	meridian	1	was	2	specified,	1	as	1	earth's	1	(at	1	greenwich),	1	choice	1	an-arbitrary-point;	1	mädler	2	and	2	beer	2	selected	1	a-line	1	for	1	first	1	maps	1	mars	1	in	1	1830.	1
2491	after	1	the-spacecraft-mariner	1	9	1	provided	1	extensive-imagery	1	of	3	mars	1	in	2	1972,	1	a-small-crater	1	(later	1	called	1	airy-0),	1	located	1	the-sinus-meridiani	1	("middle-bay"	1	or	1	"meridian-bay"),	1	was	1	chosen	1	by	1	merton-davies	1	the-rand-corporation	1	for	1	the-definition	1	0.0°-longitude	1	to	1	coincide	1	with	1	the-original-selection.	1
2492	because	1	mars	1	has	1	no-oceans	1	and	1	hence-no-"sea-level",	1	a-zero-elevation-surface	1	had	1	to	2	be	1	selected	1	as	1	a-reference-level;	1	this	1	is	1	called	1	the	1	areoid	1	of	1	mars,	1	analogous	1	the-terrestrial-geoid.	1
2493	this-pressure	2	corresponds	1	to	1	the-triple-point	1	of	2	water,	1	and	1	is	1	about-0.6%	1	the-sea-level-surface-pressure	1	on	1	earth	1	(0.006-atm).	1
2494	for	2	mapping-purposes,	1	the-united-states-geological-survey	1	divides	1	the-surface	1	of	1	mars	1	into	1	thirty-cartographic-quadrangles,	1	each	1	named	1	a-classical-albedo-feature	1
2495	research	1	in	2	2008	1	has	1	presented	1	evidence	1	regarding	1	a-theory	1	proposed	1	1980	1	postulating	1	that,	1	four	1	billion	1	years	1	ago,	1	the-northern-hemisphere	1	of	2	mars	1	was	1	struck	1	by	1	an-object	1	one-tenth	1	to	1	two-thirds-the-size	1	earth's-moon.	1
2496	mars	1	is	1	scarred	1	by	1	a-number	1	of	3	impact-craters:	1	a-total	1	43,000-craters	1	with	1	a-diameter	1	5-kilometres	1	(3.1-mi)	1	or	1	greater	1	have	1	been	1	found.	1
2497	due	1	to	1	the-smaller-mass	1	and	1	size	1	of	3	mars,	1	the-probability	1	an-object	1	colliding	1	with	1	the-planet	1	is	1	about	1	half	1	that	1	earth.	1
2498	mars	2	is	1	located	1	closer	1	to	1	the-asteroid-belt,	1	so	1	has	1	an-increased-chance	1	of	1	being	1	struck	1	by	1	materials	1	from	1	that-source.	1
2499	mars	1	is	1	more	1	likely	1	to	1	be	1	struck	1	by	1	short-period-comets,	1	i.e.,	1	those	1	that	1	lie	1	within	1	the-orbit	1	of	1	jupiter.	1
2500	in	1	spite	1	of	2	this,	1	there	1	are	1	far-fewer-craters	1	on	1	mars	2	compared	1	with	1	the-moon,	1	because	1	the-atmosphere	1	provides	1	protection	1	against	1	small-meteors	1	and	1	surface-modifying-processes	1	have	1	erased	1	some-craters.	1
2501	by	1	comparison,	1	the-grand-canyon	1	on	1	earth	1	is	1	only-446-kilometres	1	(277-mi)	1
2502	in	1	2012,	1	valles-marineris	2	was	1	proposed	1	that	1	is	1	not	1	just-a-graben,	1	but	1	a	2	plate	1	boundary	1	where	1	150-kilometres	1	(93-mi)	1	of	1	transverse-motion	1	has	1	occurred,	1	making	1	mars	1	planet	1	with	1	possibly-a-two-tectonic-plate-arrangement.	1
2503	compared	1	to	1	earth,	1	the-atmosphere	1	of	1	mars	1	is	1	quite	1	rarefied.	1
2504	the-highest-atmospheric-density	1	on	1	mars	1	is	1	equal	1	to	1	that	1	found	1	35-kilometres	1	(22-mi)	1	above	1	earth's-surface.	1
2505	the-resulting-mean-surface-pressure	1	is	1	only-0.6%	1	of	2	that	1	earth	1	101.3-kpa	1	(14.69	1	psi).	1
2506	the-scale-height	1	of	5	the-atmosphere	2	is	3	about-10.8-kilometres	1	(6.7-mi),	1	which	1	higher	1	than	1	earth's,	2	6-kilometres	1	(3.7-mi),	1	because	1	the-surface-gravity	1	mars	1	only-about-38%	1	an-effect	1	offset	1	by	1	both-the-lower-temperature	1	and	1	50%-higher-average-molecular-weight	1	mars.	1
2507	the-atmosphere	1	of	3	mars	1	consists	1	about-96%-carbon-dioxide,	1	1.93%-argon	1	and	2	1.89%-nitrogen	1	along	1	with	1	traces	1	oxygen	1	water.	1
2508	the-atmosphere	1	of	1	mars	1	is	1	quite	1	dusty,	1	containing	1	particulates	1	about	1	1.5	1	µm	1	in	1	diameter	1	which	1	give	1	the-martian-sky	1	a-tawny-color	1	when	1	seen	1	from	1	the-surface.	1
2509	in	2	september	1	2017,	1	nasa	1	reported	1	radiation-levels	1	on	1	the-surface	1	of	2	the-planet	1	mars	1	were	2	temporarily	1	doubled,	1	and	1	associated	1	with	1	an-aurora	1	25	1	times	1	brighter	1	than	1	any	1	observed	1	earlier,	1	due	1	to	1	a-massive,-and-unexpected,-solar-storm	1	the-middle	1	the-month.	1
2510	of	3	all-the-planets	1	in	1	the-solar-system,	1	the-seasons	1	mars	1	are	1	the	1	most	1	earth-like,	1	due	1	to	1	the-similar-tilts	1	the-two-planets'-rotational-axes.	1
2511	the-lengths	1	of	3	the-seasons	1	mars	1	are	1	about	2	twice	1	those	1	earth's	1	because	1	mars's	1	greater	1	distance	1	from	1	the-sun	1	leads	1	to	1	the-martian-year	1	being	1	two	1	earth	1	years	1	long.	1

2513	if	1	mars	3	had	1	an-earth-like-orbit,	1	seasons	1	would	1	be	1	similar	2	to	2	earth's	1	because	1	axial	1	tilt	1	is	1	earth's.	1

4382	when	1	the-millennium-falcon	2	tries	1	to	3	take	1	off,	1	starkiller	1	seizes	1	with	1	the-force	1	while	1	goading	1	skywalker	2	give	1	into	1	the-dark-side	1	rescue	1	friends.	1

4386	developers	1	tried	1	not	1	to	4	make	1	starkiller	1	so	1	evil	1	that	1	players	1	would	1	have	1	difficulty	1	connecting	1	the-character,	1	aiming	1	strike	1	a-balance	1	between	1	loyalty	1	the-character	2	master	1	and	1	growing	1	sense	1	of	1	disillusionment	1	with	1	the-empire.	1
4387	the-character's-name	1	is	1	an-homage	1	to	1	"anakin-starkiller,"	1	the-original-name	1	of	1	the-character	1	that	1	eventually	1	became	1	luke-skywalker.	1

4390	a-young-princess-leia-introduction	1	early	1	in	1	the-game	1	allows	1	the-relationship	1	with	1	starkiller	1	to	1	develop,	1	and	1	a-young-princess-leia-inclusion	1	helps	1	"recapture	1	that	1	rich-ensemble	1	feel	1	of	1	the-original-star-wars".	1
4391	the-name	1	"juno-eclipse"	1	was	2	originally	1	proposed	1	as	2	a-name	1	for	1	the-character	1	eventually	1	called	1	"asajj	1	ventress"	1	—	1	it	1	ultimately	1	rejected	1	insufficiently	1	villainous.	1

4393	developers	2	realized	1	early	1	that	1	starkiller	1	would	1	require	1	insight	1	into	1	the-force	1	from	2	someone	1	other	1	than	1	darth-vader;	1	after	1	rejecting	1	the-idea	1	of	4	this	1	coming	1	the-spirit	1	qui-gon-jinn	1	or	1	some-version	1	darth-plagueis,	1	decided	1	to	1	fill	1	this-role	1	with	1	one	1	starkiller's	1	jedi	1	opponents.	1
4394	the-character	1	was	1	conceived	1	as	1	a	1	"tough-as-nails"	1	contrast	1	to	1	the-more-traditional-image	1	of	1	a-jedi	1	represented	1	by	1	jinn	1	and	1	obi-wan-kenobi.	1
4395	the-character	2	changed	1	little	1	after	1	being	1	conceived;	1	fredricksen's-own-traits	1	made	1	tougher.	1
4396	the-character	1	was	1	originally	1	conceived	1	as	1	a-pirate-captain,	1	and	1	christianson's-early-art	1	included	1	brood's-distinctive-lightsaber-tonfas.	1

4402	production	1	was	2	greatly	1	aided	1	by	1	concept-art,	1	which	1	intended	1	to	2	visually	1	bridge	1	the-two-star-wars-trilogies,	1	convey	1	the-impression	1	of	1	a	1	"lived-in"	1	universe,	1	show	1	how	1	the-galaxy	1	changes	1	under	1	imperial-rule,	1	and	1	seem	1	familiar	1	yet	1	new.	1

4404	the-idea	1	of	4	"reimagining"	1	the-force	2	as	1	"amped	1	up"	1	in	1	unleashed	1	aligned	1	with	1	lucasarts'-overall-goal	1	harnessing	1	the-power	1	the-latest-video-game-consoles	1	to	1	"dramatically"-change-gaming,	1	specifically	1	through	1	the-use	1	simulation-based-gameplay.	1

4854	lucas	3	initially	1	rejected	1	casting	1	ford	2	for	1	the-role,	1	as	1	"wanted	1	new-faces";	1	had	1	previously	1	worked	1	with	1	on	1	american-graffiti.	1
4855	instead,	1	lucas	1	asked	1	ford	1	to	1	assist	1	in	1	the-auditions	1	by	1	reading	1	lines	1	with	1	the-other-actors	2	and	2	explaining	1	the-concepts	1	history	1	behind	1	the-scenes	1	that	1	were	1	reading.	1
4856	lucas	2	was	1	eventually	1	won	1	over	1	by	1	ford's-portrayal	1	and	1	cast	1	instead	1	of	1	kurt-russell,	1	nick-nolte,	1	sylvester-stallone,	1	bill-murray,	1	christopher-walken,	1	burt-reynolds,	1	jack-nicholson,	1	al-pacino,	1	steve-martin,	1	chevy-chase,	1	or	1	perry-king	1	(who	1	later	1	played	1	han-solo	1	in	1	the	1	radio	1	plays).	1
4857	lucas	2	originally	1	had	1	peter-cushing	1	in	2	mind	1	for	1	the-role	2	of	2	obi-wan-kenobi,	1	but	1	believed	1	that	1	"lucas	1	lean	1	features"	1	would	1	be	1	better	1	employed	1	grand-moff-tarkin	1	instead.	1
4858	lucas	1	commended	1	peter-cushing's-performance,	1	saying	1	"[lucas]	1	is	1	a-very-good-actor.	1

4861	guinness	1	was	1	one	1	of	2	the-few-cast-members	1	who	1	believed	1	that	1	the-film	1	would	1	be	1	successful;	1	japanese-actor-toshiro-mifune	2	(who	2	starred	2	in	3	many-akira-kurosawa-films)	2	negotiated	1	a-deal	1	for	1	2.25%	1	the-one-fifth-gross-royalties	1	paid	1	to	1	lucas,	1	which	1	made	1	quite	1	wealthy	1	later-life.	1
4862	lucas	1	credited	1	he	1	with	1	inspiring	1	the-cast	1	and	1	crew	1	to	2	work	1	harder,	1	saying	1	that	1	guinness	1	contributed	1	significantly	1	the-completion	1	of	1	the-filming.	1
4863	a-protocol-droid	1	who	1	is	1	"fluent	1	in	2	over-six-million-forms	1	of	2	communication"	1	saw	1	a-ralph-mcquarrie-drawing	1	the-character	1	and	1	was	1	struck	1	by	1	the-vulnerability	1	the-robot's-face.	1
4864	initially,	1	lucas	1	did	1	not	1	intend	1	to	1	use	1	anthony-daniels	1	as	1	c-3po:	1
4865	lucas	1	originally	1	intended	1	for	1	orson-welles	1	to	3	voice	1	the-character	1	after	1	dismissing	1	david-prowse	3	due	1	west	1	country	1	english	1	accent	1	(which	1	led	1	being	1	nicknamed,	1	within	1	the-cast,	1	as	1	"darth-farmer").	1
4866	however,	1	determining	1	that	1	orson-welles-voice	1	would	1	be	1	too	1	familiar	1	to	1	audiences,	1	lucas	1	instead	1	cast	1	then-relatively-less-recognizable-james-earl-jones	1	as	1	the-voice	1	of	1	darth-vader.	1
4867	lucas	3	had	1	the-idea	1	for	1	a-space-fantasy-film	1	in	1	1971,	1	after	1	completed	1	directing	1	first-full-length-feature,	1	thx	1	1138.	1
4868	originally,	1	lucas	3	wanted	1	to	1	adapt	1	the-flash-gordon-space-adventure-comics	1	and	1	serials	1	into	1	own	1	films,	1	having	1	been	1	fascinated	1	by	1	his-own-films	1	since	1	was	1	young.	1
4869	lucas	1	later	1	said:	1	i	1	especially	1	loved	1	the-flash-gordon-serials	1	...	1
4870	at	1	the-cannes-film-festival	1	following	1	the-completion	1	of	1	thx	1	1138,	1	lucas	1	pushed	1	towards	1	buying	1	the-flash-gordon-rights,	1	but	1	the-flash-gordon-rights	1	were	1	already	1	tied-up	1	with	1	dino-de-laurentiis.	1
4871	lucas	1	later	1	recounted:	1	i	2	wanted	1	to	2	make	1	a-flash-gordon-movie,	1	with	1	all-the-trimmings,	1	but	1	couldn't	1	obtain	1	the-rights	1	the-characters.	1
4872	director-francis-ford-coppola,	1	who	1	accompanied	1	lucas	1	in	2	trying	1	to	1	buy	1	the-flash-gordon-rights,	1	recounted	1	1999:	1	"	1
4873	lucas	3	would	1	later	1	claim	1	that	2	had	1	the-idea	1	for	1	an-original-space-opera	1	long	1	before	2	1971,	1	and	1	even	1	tried	1	to	1	film	1	it	1	american-graffiti.	1
4874	believing	1	that	1	the-bleak-tone	1	of	1	thx	1	1138	1	led	2	to	3	its-poor-reception,	1	lucas	1	chose	1	make	1	star-wars	1	more	1	optimistic;	1	this	1	is	1	what	1	its-fun-and-adventurous-tone.	1
4875	lucas	1	went	1	to	1	united-artists	3	and	1	showed	1	the-script	1	for	1	american-graffiti,	1	but	1	passed	1	on	1	the-film,	1	which	1	was	1	then	1	picked	1	up	1	by	1	universal-pictures.	1
4876	united-artists	1	also	1	passed	1	on	1	lucas-space-opera-concept,	1	which	1	lucas	1	shelved	1	for	1	the	1	time	1	being.	1
4877	after	1	spending	1	the-next-two-years	1	completing	1	american-graffiti,	1	lucas	3	turned	1	attention	1	to	1	space	1	opera.	1
4878	lucas	1	drew	1	inspiration	1	from	1	politics	1	of	1	the-era,	1	later	1	saying,	1	“it	1	was	3	really	1	about	1	the-vietnam-war,	1	and	1	that	1	the-period	1	where	1	nixon	1	trying	1	to	1	run	1	for	1	a-[second]-term.	1	"	1
4879	lucas	1	began	1	writing	1	in	1	january	1	1973,	1	"eight	1	hours	1	a	2	day,	1	five-days	1	week",	1	by	1	taking	1	small-notes,	1	inventing	1	odd-names	2	and	1	assigning	1	possible-characterizations.	1
4880	lucas	2	would	1	discard	1	many	1	of	1	these	1	by	1	the-time	1	the-final-script	3	was	1	written,	1	but	1	included	1	several-names	1	and	1	places	1	in	1	or	1	sequels.	1
4881	lucas	1	used	1	these-initial-names	1	and	1	ideas	1	to	1	compile	1	a-two-page-synopsis	1	titled	1	journal	1	of	3	the-whills,	1	which	1	told	1	the-tale	1	the-training	1	apprentice-cj-thorpe	1	as	1	a-"jedi-bendu"-space-commando	1	by	1	the-legendary-mace	1	windy.	1
4882	frustrated	1	that	1	his-story	1	was	1	too	1	difficult	1	to	1	understand,	1	lucas	1	then	1	began	1	writing	1	a-13-page-treatment	1	called	1	the	1	star	1	wars	1	on	1	april	1	17,	1	1973,	1	which	1	had	1	narrative-parallels	1	with	1	kurosawa's-1958-film	1	the-hidden-fortress.	1
4883	lucas	2	and	2	producer-gary-kurtz	2	presented	1	the-film-treatment	1	to	1	universal-pictures,	1	the-studio	1	that	1	financed	1	american-graffiti;	1	while	1	agreed	1	it	1	could	1	be	1	"a-very-commercial-venture",	1
4884	lucas	3	and	2	producer	1	gary-kurtz	1	had	1	doubts	1	about	1	ability	1	to	1	pull	1	it	1	all	1	off,"	1	said	1	that	1	should	1	follow	1	american-graffiti	1	with	1	more-consequential-themes.	1
4885	lucas	1	said,	1	"i've	1	always	1	been	1	an-outsider	1	to	1	hollywood-types.	1
4886	kurtz	1	said,	1	"although	1	star-wars	1	wasn't	1	like	1	[then-current-science-fiction]	1	at	1	all,	1	it	1	was	1	just	1	sort	1	of	2	lumped	1	into	1	that-same-kind	1	category.	1
4887	"lucas	1	explained	1	in	1	1977	1	that	2	the-film	2	is	2	not	1	"about	1	the-future"	1	and	1	"is	1	a-fantasy	1	much	1	closer	1	to	2	the-brothers-grimm	1	than	1	it	1	2001."	1
4888	lucas	1	would	1	later	1	recontextualize	1	the-discussion	1	around	1	the-film,	1	saying	1	the-film	1	was	1	born	1	out	1	of	2	research	1	into	1	"psychological-underpinings	1	mythology",	1	a	1	claim	1	that	1	had	1	been	1	dismissed	1	by	1	kurtz	1	as	1	self-aggrandizing:	1	"	1
4889	the-whole-idea	1	of	3	star-wars	2	as	1	a-mythological-thing,	1	i	1	think	1	came	1	about	1	because	1	[later--lucas]-interviews	1	that	2	tied	1	the-film	1	to	1	the-hero	1	with	1	a-thousand-faces"	1	and	4	by	1	steven-hart	1	michael-kaminski:	1	"it	1	is	1	here	1	the-true-origin	1	comes	1	from	3	--	1	not	1	myth	1	legend,	1	but	1	the-'schlock'	1	sold	1	on	1	newspapers	1	stands	1	played	1	in	1	matinees.	1
4890	lucas	1	and	2	kurtz,	1	in	1	pitching	1	the-film,	1	said	1	that	1	it	1	would	1	be	2	"low-budget,	1	roger-corman-style,	1	the-budget	1	was	1	never	1	going	1	to	1	more	1	than—	1
4891	after	1	disney	1	rejected	1	the-project,	1	lucas	1	and	2	kurtz	1	persisted	1	in	1	securing	1	a-studio	1	to	1	support	1	the-film	3	because	1	"other-people	1	had	1	read	1	said,	1	'yeah,	1	could	1	be	1	a-good-idea.'	1
4892	lucas	1	pursued	1	alan-ladd-jr.,	1	the-head	1	of	1	20th-century-fox,	1	and	2	in	1	june	1	1973	1	completed	1	a-deal	1	to	1	write	1	direct	1	the-film.	1
4893	although	1	ladd	2	did	1	not	1	grasp	1	the-technical-side	1	of	1	the-project,	1	believed	1	that	1	lucas	1	was	1	talented.	1
4894	lucas	2	later	1	stated	1	that	1	ladd	1	"invested	1	in	2	me,	1	did	1	not	1	invest	1	the-movie."	1
4895	the-deal	1	gave	1	lucas	1	$150,000	1	to	1	write	1	and	1	direct	1	the-film.	1
4896	american-graffiti's-positive-reception	1	afforded	1	lucas	2	the-leverage	1	necessary	1	to	2	renegotiate	1	deal	1	with	1	ladd	1	and	1	request	1	the-sequel-rights	1	the-film	1	in	1	august	1	1973.	1
4897	since	1	commencing	1	lucas-writing-process	1	in	2	january	1	1973,	1	lucas	1	had	1	done	1	"various-rewrites	1	the-evenings	1	after	1	the-day's-work.	1
4898	lucas	1	would	1	write	1	four-different-screenplays	1	for	2	star-wars,	1	"searching	1	just-the-right-ingredients,	1	characters	1	and	1	storyline.	1
4899	lucas	1	envisioned	1	the-corellian-smuggler,	1	han-solo,	1	as	1	a-large,-green-skinned-monster	1	with	1	gills.	1
4900	lucas	5	based	1	chewbacca	1	on	1	alaskan	1	malamute	1	dog,	1	indiana	2	(whom	1	would	1	later	1	use	1	as	2	eponym	1	for	1	character	1	jones),	1	who	1	often	1	acted	1	the	1	director's	1	"co-pilot"	1	by	1	sitting	1	in	1	the-passenger-seat	1	of	1	car.	1
4901	lucas	1	completed	1	a-second-draft	1	in	1	january	1	1975	1	as	2	adventures	1	of	1	the-starkiller,	1	episode	1	one:	1	the-star-wars,	1	making	1	heavy-simplifications	1	and	1	introducing	1	the-young-hero	1	on	1	a-farm	1	luke-starkiller.	1
4902	for	1	example,	1	luke	2	had	1	several-brothers,	1	as	2	well	1	father,	1	who	1	appears	1	in	1	a-minor-role	1	at	1	the-end	1	of	1	the-film.	1
4903	this-draft	2	was	2	also	1	the	2	first	2	to	5	introduce	1	the-concept	1	of	1	a	1	jedi	1	turning	1	the-dark-side:	1	included	1	a-historical-jedi	1	who	1	ever	1	fall	1	the-dark-side,	1	and	1	then	1	trained	1	the-sith	1	use	1	this-version.	1
4904	the-script	1	would	2	introduce	1	the-concept	1	of	1	a-jedi-master	2	and	1	son,	1	who	1	trains	1	to	1	be	1	a-jedi	1	under	1	jedi-father's-friend;	1	this	1	ultimately	1	form	1	the-basis	1	for	1	the-film	1	and,	1	later,	1	the-trilogy.	1
4905	according	1	to	2	lucas,	1	the-second-draft	1	was	1	over	2	200	1	pages	1	long,	1	and	1	led	1	lucas	1	split	1	up	1	the-story	1	into	1	multiple-films	1	spanning	1	multiple-trilogies.	1
4906	lucas	1	began	1	to	1	rewrite	1	the-second-draft,	1	creating	1	a-synopsis	1	for	1	the-third-draft.	1
4907	during	1	work	1	on	1	this-rewrite,	1	lucas	1	began	1	researching	1	the-science-fiction-genre	1	by	1	watching	1	films	1	and	2	reading	1	books	1	(including	1	j.-r.-r.-tolkien's-the-hobbit)	1	comics.	1
4908	lucas	1	also	1	claims	1	to	1	have	1	read	1	scholastic-works	1	like	1	joseph-campbell's-the-hero	1	with	1	a-thousand-faces,	1	james-george-frazer's-the-golden-bough,	1	and	1	even-bruno-bettelheim's-the-uses	1	of	1	enchantment.	1
4909	these-claims	1	are	1	doubted	1	by	1	michael-kaminski	2	and	3	chris-taylor,	1	with	1	pointing	1	out	2	that	2	bettelheim's-book	1	would	1	not	1	come	1	until	1	after	1	star-wars	1	was	1	filmed	1	adding	1	"the-original-trilogy-campbell-connection	1	is	2	greatly	1	exaggerated	1	practically	1	non-existent",	1	noting	1	that,	1	in	1	fact,	1	the-second-draft	1	"even	1	closer	1	to	1	campbell's-structure"	1	than	1	the-third.	1
4910	according	1	to	1	lucas,	1	lucas	1	wrote	1	a-rough-draft	1	of	1	about-250–300-pages	1	long,	1	which	1	contained	1	the-outline	1	for	1	the-entire-original-star-wars-trilogy.	1
4911	lucas	1	realized	1	that	1	it	2	was	1	too	1	long	1	for	1	a-single-film,	1	and	1	decided	1	to	1	subdivide	1	into	1	a-trilogy.	1
4912	lucas	1	stated	1	that	3	the-story	1	evolved	1	over	1	time	1	and	1	"there	1	was	1	never	1	a-script	1	completed	1	had	1	the-entire-story	1	as	1	it	1	exists	1	now	1	[in	1	1983]	1	...	1
4913	in	1	1975	1	lucas	1	suggested	1	he	1	could	1	make	1	a-trilogy,	1	which	1	"ends	1	with	1	the-destruction	1	of	2	the-empire"	1	and	1	a-possible-prequel	1	"about	1	the-backstory	1	kenobi	1	as	1	a-young-man."	1
4914	after	1	the-film's-smash-success,	1	lucasfilm	1	announced	1	that	1	lucas	1	had	1	already	1	written	1	"twelve-stories	1	in	1	the-adventures	1	of	1	luke-skywalker"	1	which,	1	according	1	to	2	kurtz,	1	were	1	set	1	be	1	"separate-adventures	1	rather	1	than	1	direct-sequels.	1	"	1
4915	the-writing	1	of	3	the-third-draft,	1	lucas	4	hired	1	conceptual-artist-ralph-mcquarrie	2	to	2	create	1	paintings	1	certain-scenes,	1	several	1	which	1	included	1	with	1	screenplay	1	when	1	delivered	1	20th-century-fox.	1
4916	subsequently,	1	lucas	1	started	1	writing	1	with	1	a-budget	1	in	1	mind,	1	conceiving	1	the	1	cheap,	1	"used"	1	look	1	of	3	much	1	the-film,	1	and	1	(with	1	fox	1	having	1	just	1	shut	1	down	1	the-film	1	special	1	effects	1	department)	1	reducing	1	the-number	1	complex-special-effects-shots	1	called	1	for	1	by	1	the-script.	1
4917	the-third-draft,	1	dated	1	august	1	1,	1	1975,	1	was	1	titled	1	the	1	star	1	wars	1	from	1	the-adventures	1	of	1	luke-starkiller.	1
4918	the-third-draft,	1	dated	1	august	1	1,	1	1975	1	had	1	most	1	of	2	the-elements	1	the-final-plot,	1	with	1	only-some-differences	1	in	1	the-characters	1	and	1	settings.	1
4919	the-draft	1	characterized	1	luke	3	as	1	an-only-child,	1	with	2	father	1	already	1	dead,	1	replacing	1	a-substitute	1	named	1	ben	1	kenobi.	1
4920	lucas	2	worked	1	with	1	friends	1	gloria-katz	1	and	1	willard-huyck	1	to	1	revise	1	the-fourth-draft	1	into	1	the-final-pre-production-script.	1
4921	lucas	1	finished	1	writing	1	the-final-pre-production-script	1	in	1	march	1	1976,	1	when	1	the-crew	1	started	1	filming.	1
4922	during	1	production,	1	he	1	changed	1	luke's-name	1	from	1	starkiller	1	to	2	skywalker	1	and	2	altered	1	the-title	1	the-star-wars	1	later-star-wars.	1
4923	for	1	the-film's-opening-crawl,	1	lucas	1	originally	1	wrote	1	a-composition	1	consisting	1	of	1	six-paragraphs	1	with	1	four-sentences	1	each.	1
4924	lucas	1	said,	1	"the-crawl	1	is	1	such-a-hard-thing	1	because	1	you	1	have	1	to	1	be	1	careful	1	that	2	you're	1	not	1	using	1	too-many-words	1	people	1	don't	1	understand.	1
4925	"	1	lucas	1	showed	1	his-draft	1	to	1	his-friends.	1
4926	lucas	1	recounted	1	what	1	de-palma	2	said	1	the	1	first	1	time	1	saw	1	it:	1	"george,	1	you're	1	out	1	of	1	your-mind!	1
4927	two	1	years	1	later,	1	after	1	completing	1	american-graffiti,	1	lucas	3	approached	1	mcquarrie	1	and	1	asked	1	if	1	would	1	be	1	interested	1	"in	1	doing	1	something	1	for	1	star-wars."	1
4928	the-film	1	was	1	ambitious	1	as	1	lucas	1	wanted	1	to	1	create	1	fresh-prop-prototypes	1	and	1	sets	1	(based	1	on	1	mcquarrie's-paintings)	1	that	1	had	1	never	1	been	1	realized	1	before	1	in	1	science-fiction-films.	1
4929	lucas	2	commissioned	1	production-designers	1	john-barry	1	and	1	roger-christian,	1	who	1	were	1	working	1	on	2	the-sets	1	of	1	the-film	1	lucky-lady	1	(1975)	1	when	1	first	1	approached	1	them,	1	to	1	work	1	the-production-sets.	1
4930	they	2	had	1	a-conversation	1	with	2	lucas	1	on	1	what	1	he	1	would	1	like	1	the-film	1	to	1	appear	1	like,	1	creating	1	the-desired-sets.	1
4931	christian	2	said	1	that	1	lucas	1	"didn't	1	want	1	anything	1	[in	1	star-wars]	1	to	1	stand	1	out,	1	wanted	1	it	1	[to	1	look]	1	all	1	real	1	and	1	used.	1
4932	lucas	1	described	1	a-"used-future"-concept	1	to	3	the-production-designers	1	in	1	which	1	all-devices,	1	ships,	1	and	2	buildings	1	do	1	with	1	tatooine	1	or	1	the-rebels	1	looked	1	aged	1	dirty,	1	as	1	opposed	1	the-sleeker-designs	1	of	1	the-empire.	1
4933	lucas	1	also	1	wanted	1	the-spaceships	1	to	2	look	1	"cobbled	1	together,	1	as	1	opposed	1	a-sleek-monoshape."	1
4934	"	1	lucas	1	believed	1	that	2	"what	1	is	2	required	1	for	1	true-credibility	1	a-used-future",	1	opposing	1	the-interpretation	1	of	1	"future	1	in	1	most-futurist-movies"	1	"always	1	looks	1	new	1	and	2	clean	1	shiny."	1
4935	"the-designers	1	started	1	working	1	with	1	the-director	1	before	1	star-wars	1	was	1	approved	1	by	1	20th-century-fox.	1
4936	although	1	lucas	2	initially	1	provided	1	funds	1	using	1	earnings	1	from	1	american-graffiti,	1	it	1	was	1	inadequate.	1
4937	he	1	suggested	1	that	1	lucas	1	use	1	scrap	1	in	1	making	1	the-dressings,	1	and	1	the-director	1	agreed.	1
4938	in	1	1975,	1	lucas	2	formed	1	own	1	visual-effects-company-industrial-light	1	&	1	magic	1	(ilm)	1	after	1	discovering	1	that	1	20th-century-fox's-visual-effects-department	1	had	1	been	1	disbanded.	1
4939	ilm	2	began	1	work	1	on	1	star-wars	1	in	2	a-warehouse	1	van-nuys.	1
4940	however,	1	since	1	the-film	2	is	1	a-fairy-tale,	1	as	1	george-lucas	1	had	1	described,	1	"i	1	still	1	wanted	1	to	1	have	2	an-ethereal-quality,	1	yet	1	be	1	well	1	composed	1	and,	1	also,	1	an-alien-look."	1
4941	george-lucas	1	designed	1	the-film	1	to	1	have	1	an	1	"extremely	1	bizarre,	1	gregg	1	toland-like	1	surreal	1	look	1	with	1	strange-over-exposed-colors,	1	a-lot	2	of	2	shadows,	1	hot-areas.	1
4942	"	1	lucas	1	wanted	1	star-wars	1	to	2	embrace	1	the-combination	1	of	3	"strange-graphics	1	fantasy"	1	and	1	"the-feel	1	a-documentary"	1	impress	1	a-distinct-look.	1
4943	unsworth	2	was	2	interested	1	in	1	working	1	with	1	the-director,	1	and	2	initially	1	accepted	1	the-job	2	when	1	offered	1	to	1	by	1	lucas	1	kurtz.	1
4944	lucas	2	called	1	up	1	for	2	other-cinematographers,	1	and	2	eventually	1	chose	1	taylor,	1	basing	1	choice	1	on	1	taylor's	1	cinematography	1	dr.-strangelove	1	a-hard-day's-night	1	(both	1	1964).	1
4945	on	1	lucas-decision,	1	lucas	1	said:	1	"i	1	thought	1	they	1	were	1	good,	1	eccentrically	1	photographed	1	pictures	1	with	1	a-strong-documentary-flavor.	1	"	1
4946	taylor	1	said	1	that	1	lucas,	1	who	1	was	1	consumed	1	by	1	the-details	1	of	1	the-complicated-production,	1	"avoided	1	all-meetings	1	and	2	contact	1	with	1	lucas	1	from	1	day	1	one,	1	so	1	i	2	read	1	the-extra-long-script	1	many	1	times	1	made	1	my-own-decisions	1	as	1	to	1	how	1	would	1	shoot	1	the-picture."	1
4947	during	1	production,	1	lucas	1	and	2	taylor—whom	1	kurtz	1	called	1	"old-school"	1	"crotchety"—had	1	disputes	1	over	1	filming.	1
4948	with	1	a-background	1	in	1	independent-filmmaking,	1	lucas	1	was	1	accustomed	1	to	1	creating	1	most	1	of	2	the-elements	1	the-film	1	himself.	1
4949	his-lighting-suggestions	1	were	1	rejected	1	by	2	taylor,	1	who	1	believed	1	that	1	lucas	2	was	1	overstepping	1	boundaries	1	giving	1	specific-instructions,	1	sometimes	1	even	1	moving	1	lights	1	and	1	cameras	1	himself.	1
4950	lucas	1	would]	1	say,	1	'turn	1	off	2	this-light,	1	and	1	turn	1	this-light.'	1
4951	originally,	1	lucas	1	envisioned	1	the-planet	1	of	2	tatooine,	1	where	1	much	1	the-film	1	would	1	take	1	place,	1	as	1	a-jungle-planet.	1
4952	gary-kurtz	3	traveled	1	to	1	the-philippines	1	to-scout-locations;	1	however,	1	because	1	of	2	the-idea	1	spending-months	1	filming	1	in	1	the-jungle	1	would	1	make	1	lucas	1	"itchy",	1	refined	1	vision	1	and	1	made	1	tatooine	1	a	1	desert	1	planet	1	instead.	1
4953	lucas	2	later	1	stated	1	that	1	had	1	wanted	1	to	1	make	1	it	1	look	1	like	1	outer-space.	1
4954	lucas	1	fell	1	behind	1	schedule	1	in	1	the-first-week	1	of	1	shooting	1	due	1	to	1	malfunctioning-props	1	and	1	electronic-breakdowns.	1
4955	"	1	given	1	this-situation,	1	lucas	1	requested	1	heavy-filtration,	1	which	1	taylor	1	rejected,	1	who	1	said:	1	"i	1	thought	1	the-look	1	of	1	the-film	1	should	1	be	1	absolutely	1	clean	1	...	1
4956	but	1	george	1	saw	1	the-film	1	differently,	1	so	1	we	1	tried	1	using	1	nets	1	and	1	other-diffusion.	1
4957	lucas	1	chose	1	hotel-sidi-driss,	1	which	1	is	1	larger	1	than	1	the-typical-underground-dwellings,	1	to	1	shoot	1	the-interior	1	of	1	luke's-homestead.	1
4958	star-wars	1	required	1	the-use	1	of	1	nine-different-sound-stages	1	simultaneously,	1	which	1	most-studios	1	couldn't	1	accommodate.	1
4959	because	1	of	2	stricter-working-conditions,	1	filming	1	in	2	britain	1	had	1	to	1	finish	1	by	1	5:30-pm,	1	unless	1	lucas	1	was	1	the-middle	1	a-scene.	1
4960	actor-baker	2	later	1	confessed	1	that	1	thought	1	the-film	1	would	1	be	1	a-failure.	1
4961	harrison-ford	1	found	1	the-film	1	strange	1	that	1	"there's	1	a-princess	2	with	1	weird-buns	1	in	2	hair",	1	and	1	called	1	chewbacca	1	a	1	"giant	1	a-monkey-suit.	1	"	1
4962	lucas	1	commissioned	1	computer-programmer-larry-cuba	1	to	1	create	1	the-animated-death-star-plans	1	shown	1	at	1	the-rebel-base	1	on	1	yavin	1	4.	1
4963	lucas	2	selected	1	the-location	1	as	1	a-potential-filming-site	1	after	1	seeing	1	a-poster	1	of	1	it	1	hanging	1	at	1	a-travel-agency	1	while	1	was	1	filming	1	in	1	britain.	1
4964	this	1	inspired	1	lucas	1	to	3	send	1	a-film-crew	1	guatemala	1	in	1	march	1	1977	1	shoot	1	scenes.	1
4965	while	2	shooting,	1	lucas	2	rarely	1	spoke	1	to	1	the-actors,	1	who	1	believed	1	that	1	expected	1	too	1	much	1	of	1	them	1	providing	1	little-direction.	1
4966	kurtz	4	has	1	said	1	that	1	lucas	1	"wasn't	1	gregarious,	1	kurtz's	1	very	2	much	1	a	1	loner	1	and	1	shy,	1	so	1	didn't	3	like	3	large-groups	1	of	2	people	1	,	1	working	2	with	2	a-large-crew,	1	a-lot	1	actors.	1	"	1
4967	ladd	1	offered	1	lucas	1	some	1	of	1	the-only-support	1	from	2	the-studio;	1	kurtz	1	dealt	1	with	1	scrutiny	1	board-members	1	over	1	the-rising-budget	1	and	1	complex-screenplay-drafts.	1
4968	"	1	at	1	the-same-time,	1	after	1	production	2	fell	1	behind	1	schedule,	1	ladd	1	told	1	lucas-lucas	1	had	1	to	2	finish	1	within	1	a-week	1	or	1	lucas	1	would	1	be	1	forced	1	shut	1	down	1	production.	1
4969	star-wars	2	was	1	originally	1	slated	1	for	1	release	1	on	1	christmas	1	1976;	1	however,	1	production	1	delays	1	pushed	1	the-film's-release	1	to	1	mid-1977.	1
4970	editor-john-jympson	2	began	1	cutting	1	the-film	1	together	1	while	1	lucas	3	was	2	still	1	filming	1	in	2	tunisia;	1	as	1	noted,	1	an-"impossible-position"	1	because	1	had	1	not	1	explained	1	any	1	of	1	the-film's	1	material	1	to	1	editor-john-jympson.	1
4971	when	1	lucas	3	watched	1	editor-john-jympson's-rough-cut	1	for	1	the-first-time,	1	disliked	1	what	1	saw.	1
4972	j.-w.-rinzler	1	wrote	1	that	1	"jympson's-selection	1	of	1	takes	1	was	1	questionable,	1	and	1	lucas	1	seemed	1	to	1	be	1	having	1	trouble	1	doing	1	match-cuts.	1
4973	lucas	2	was	1	prepared	1	to	1	give	1	editor-john-jympson	2	more	1	time;	1	disliked	1	working	1	style.	1
4974	as	1	production	1	went	1	on,	1	lucas	2	still	1	disapproved	1	of	1	jympson's	1	cut	1	and	1	fired	1	halfway	1	through	1	the-film's-production.	1
4975	lucas	1	commented:	1	"unfortunately	1	it	1	didn't	1	work	1	out.	1
4976	in	1	the-end,	1	i	1	don't	1	think	1	lucas	1	fully	1	understood	1	the-movie	1	and	1
4977	after	1	attempting	1	to	2	persuade	1	jympson	1	cut	1	the-film	2	his-way,	1	lucas	1	replaced	1	his	1	with	2	paul-hirsch,	1	richard-chew	2	and	1	then-wife,	1	marcia	1	lucas,	1	who	1	was	1	also	1	cutting	1	new-york,	1	new-york	1	(1977)	1	lucas's	1	friend	1	martin-scorsese.	1
4978	richard-chew	1	considered	1	the-film	1	to	1	have	1	been	1	cut	1	in	2	a	1	slow,	1	by-the-book	1	manner:	1	scenes	1	were	1	played	1	out	1	master-shots	1	that	1	flowed	1	into	1	close-up-coverage.	1
4979	the-most-significant-material-cut	1	was	1	a-series	1	of	2	scenes	1	from	1	the-first-part	1	the-film	1	which	1	introduced	1	luke-skywalker.	1
4980	these-early-scenes,	1	set	1	in	1	anchorhead	1	on	1	the-planet-tatooine,	1	presented	1	the-audience	1	with	1	luke's-everyday-life	1	among	1	luke-friends	1	as	1	it	1	is	1	affected	1	by	1	the-space-battle	1	above	1	the-planet;	1	they	1	also	1	introduced	1	the-character	1	of	1	biggs-darklighter,	1	luke's-closest-friend	1	who	1	departs	1	to	1	join	1	the-rebellion.	1
4981	so	1	we	1	simplified	1	the-film	1	by	1	taking	1	out	1	luke	1	and	1	biggs.	1
4982	in	2	an-examination	1	of	1	this-early-cut,	1	which	1	has	1	come	1	to	1	be	1	called	1	the	1	"lost	1	cut",	1	david-west-reynolds	1	noted	1	the-film	1	adopted	1	a-"documentary-like"-approach	1	that	1	emphasized	1	"clarity,	1	especially	1	geographic-and-spatial-relationships"	1	over	1	"dramatic-or-artistic-concerns".	1
4983	as	1	a-result,	1	the-film	1	was	1	more	1	"leisurely	1	paced".	1
4984	lucas	2	was	1	looking	1	for	1	a-way	1	of	2	accelerating	1	the-storytelling,	1	and	2	removing	1	luke's-early-scenes	1	would	1	distinguish	1	star-wars	1	from	1	earlier-teenage-drama	1	"get	1	that	1	"american-graffiti	2	in	2	outer-space	1	feel	1	out	1	outer-space.	1
4985	lucas	2	also	1	stated	1	that	1	wanted	1	to	3	move	1	the-narrative-focus	1	c-3po	1	and	1	r2-d2:	1	"at	1	the-time,	1	have	1	the-first-half-hour	1	of	1	the-film	1	be	1	mainly	1	about	1	robots	1	was	1	a-bold-idea.	1
4986	industrial-light	2	&	2	magic	2	had	1	spent	1	half	1	of	1	budget	1	on	1	four-shots	1	that	1	lucas	1	deemed	1	unacceptable.	1
4987	lucas	1	inspired	1	ilm	1	by	1	editing	1	together	1	aerial-dogfights	1	from	1	old-war-films,	1	which	1	enhanced	1	the-pacing	1	of	1	the-scenes.	1
4988	sound-designer-ben-burtt	1	had	1	created	1	a-library	1	of	1	sounds	1	that	1	lucas	1	referred	1	to	1	as	1	an-"organic-soundtrack."	1
4989	lucas	2	and	2	burtt	2	created	1	the-robotic-voice	1	of	1	r2-d2	1	by	1	filtering	1	voices	1	through	1	an-electronic-synthesizer.	1
4990	in	1	february	1	1977,	1	lucas	1	screened	1	an-early-cut	1	of	2	the-film	1	for	1	fox-executives,	1	several-director-friends,	1	along	1	with	1	roy-thomas	1	and	1	howard-chaykin	1	marvel-comics	1	who	1	were	1	preparing	1	a-star-wars-comic-book.	1
4991	an-early-cut	1	of	2	the-film	1	for	2	fox-executives,	1	several-director-friends,	1	along	1	with	1	roy-thomas	1	and	2	howard-chaykin	1	marvel-comics	1	who	1	were	1	preparing	1	a-star-wars-comic-book	1	had	1	a-different-crawl	1	from	1	the-finished-version	1	used	1	prowse's-voice	1	darth-vader's.	1
4992	an-early-cut	2	of	6	the-film	2	for	2	fox-executives,	2	several-director-friends,	2	along	2	with	2	roy-thomas	2	and	3	howard-chaykin	2	marvel-comics	2	who	2	were	2	preparing	2	a-star-wars-comic-book	2	also	1	lacked	1	most-special-effects;	1	hand-drawn-arrows	1	took	1	the-place	1	blaster-beams,	1	when	1	the-millennium-falcon	1	fought	1	tie-fighters,	1	cut	1	to	1	footage	1	world-war-ii-dogfights.	1
4993	lucas	1	later	1	said	1	that	1	the-group	1	was	1	honest	1	and	1	seemed	1	bemused	1	by	1	the-film.	1
4994	lucas	1	found	1	the-experience	1	shocking	1	and	1	rewarding,	1	having	1	never	1	gained	1	any-approval	1	from	1	studio-executives	1	before.	1
4995	with	1	the-project	1	$2	1	million	1	over	1	budget,	1	lucas	1	was	1	forced	1	to	2	make	1	numerous-artistic-compromises	1	complete	1	star-wars.	1
4996	lucas	1	had	1	to	2	write	1	around	1	a-scene	1	featuring	1	a-human-jabba	1	the-hutt,	1	which	1	was	1	scrapped	1	due	1	not	1	being	1	in	1	focus.	1
4997	lucas	3	would	1	later	1	claim	1	wanted	1	to	1	superimpose	1	a-stop-motion-creature	1	over	1	the-actor	1	-	1	which	1	did	1	in	1	the-1997-special-edition	1	with	1	a-computer-generated-version	1	of	1	jabba.	1
4998	however,	1	all-the-script-drafts	1	(with	1	the-exception	1	of	2	one	1	that	1	lucas	2	doctored	1	after	1	the-fact)	1	describe	1	jabba	1	as	1	humanoid,	1	the-notion	1	being	1	an-alien	1	not	1	having	1	come	1	up	1	until	2	work	1	on	1	the-1979-re-release,	1	and	1	scrapped	1	the-special-edition.	1
4999	lucas	2	believed	1	that	2	the-film	1	would	2	portray	1	visually-foreign-worlds,	1	but	1	the-musical-score	1	give	1	the-audience	1	an-emotional-familiarity;	1	wanted	1	a-grand-musical-sound	1	for	1	star-wars.	1
5000	therefore,	1	lucas	5	assembled	1	favorite	1	orchestral	1	pieces	1	for	1	the-soundtrack,	1	until	1	convinced	1	that	1	an-original-score	1	would	1	be	1	unique	1	and	1	more	1	unified,	1	having	1	viewed	1	music	1	choices	1	as	1	a-temp-track.	1
5001	lucas	1	would	1	later	1	deny	1	having	1	ever	1	conceived	1	using	1	extant-music	1	for	1	the-film.	1
5002	in	2	march	1	1977,	1	lucas	1	conducted	1	the-london-symphony-orchestra	1	to	1	record	1	the-soundtrack	1	12-days.	1
5003	20th-century-records	2	also	1	released	1	the-story	1	of	3	star-wars	1	that	1	same	1	year,	1	a-narrated-audio-drama-adaptation	1	the-film	1	utilizing	1	some	1	original-music,	1	dialogue,	1	and	1	sound-effects.	1
5004	according	1	to	1	george-lucas,	1	different-concepts	1	of	2	the-film	1	were	1	inspired	1	by	1	numerous-sources,	1	such	1	as	1	beowulf	1	and	2	king-arthur	1	for	1	the-origins	1	myth	1	religion.	1
5005	star-wars	1	features	1	many-elements	1	derived	1	from	1	flash-gordon,	1	such	1	as	1	the-conflict	1	between	2	rebels	1	and	3	imperial-forces,	1	the-wipes	1	scenes,	1	the-fusion	1	of	1	futuristic-technology	1	traditional-mythology,	1	the-famous-opening-crawl	1	that	1	begins	1	each-film.	1
5006	the-film	1	has	1	also	1	been	1	compared	1	to	1	the-wizard	1	of	1	oz.	1
5007	the-influence	1	of	1	the-hidden-fortress	1	can	1	be	1	seen	2	in	2	the-relationship	1	between	1	c-3po	1	and	3	r2-d2,	1	which	1	evolved	1	from	1	the-two-bickering-peasants,	1	tahei	1	matashichi,	1	a-japanese-family-crest	1	the-film	1	is	1	similar	1	to	1	the-imperial-crest.	1
5008	star-wars	1	also	1	borrows	1	heavily	1	from	1	another-kurosawa-film,	1	yojimbo	1	(1961).	1
5009	arrakis	1	is	1	the-only-known-source	1	of	2	a-longevity-spice;	1	star-wars	1	makes	1	references	1	to	1	spice	1	in	1	"the-spice-mines	1	kessel",	1	and	1	a-spice-freighter.	1
5010	frank-herbert	1	reported	1	that	2	"david-lynch,	1	[director	1	of	2	the-1984-film-dune]	1	had	1	trouble	1	with	1	the-fact	1	star-wars	1	used	1	up	1	so	1	much	1	the-1984-film-dune.	1
5011	in	2	addition,	1	the-sequence	1	was	1	partially	1	inspired	1	by	3	the-climax	1	of	1	the-film	1	633	1	squadron	1	(1964),	1	directed	1	walter-grauman,	1	which	1	raf-de-havilland-mosquitos	1	attack	1	a-german-heavy-water-plant	1	flying	1	down	1	a-narrow-fjord	1	to	1	drop	1	special-bombs	1	at	1	a-precise-point,	1	while	1	avoiding	1	anti-aircraft-guns	1	and	1	german-fighters.	1
5012	the-earlier-big-budget-science-fiction-film	1	influenced	1	the-look	1	of	2	star-wars	1	in	1	many-other-ways,	1	including	1	the-use	1	eva-pods	1	and	1	hexagonal-corridors.	1
